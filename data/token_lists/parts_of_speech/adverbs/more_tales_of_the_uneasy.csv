Well

Now
sulkily
Adelaide

Not

clever

shud-
right
economically
indeed
extravagantly
later
Only
however
Adelaide
Never
bitterly
sly
even
possibly
even
away
soon
Meanwhile
Sometimes
Then
actually
boldly
longer
sadly
better
suddenly
back
longer
probably
always

However
boldly
homely
quizzically
slightly
Then
Quickly
obediently

unwillingly

Now
away
away

helplessly
Well
Even
Never
always
Just
long
agonizedly
away
far
Adelaide
patiently
nearly
thus
broadly
generally
favourably
strongly
undoubtedly
probably
strongly
also
finally
sly
So
unquestioningly
altogether
lazily
together
quite
well
always
hardly
soon
passionately
Then
Adelaide
softly
back
quite
quietly
Then
pleadingly
away
away
never
away
quick
away
fast
contemptuously
squarely
better
even
quietly
well
much
gently
even
lightly
sharply
yes
actually
quite

morbidly
sometimes
lately
well
beastly
never

Indeed

Well

rather

forward

never
automatically
tightly
swiftly
away
studiously
home
rather
unaccountably
quite
fretfully
secretly
however
quite
better
merely
abruptly
never
ever
away
together
much
probably
away
fully
luxuriantly
Once
however
quite
surely
presumably
'ere
ever
half
back
always
rather
abroad
always
heavily
mediaevally
along
carelessly
easily
enough
especially
plainly
already
right
finally
even
longer
much
away
sometimes
rather
sternly
Well
Well
little
Still
presumably
well
apparently
away
often
always
remem-
never
ever
never
almost
exactly
perhaps
mostly
generally
endlessly
far
Thus
generally
kindly
well
never
seriously
away
quite
well
back
far
suddenly
generally
straight
altogether
coldly
Certainly
unwell
away
Not
kindly
Perhaps
indeed
away
nearly
never
still
never
rather
everywhere
alone
kindly
quite
quite
gently
carefully
carefully
hardly
Here
almost
originally
well
still
Slowly
Here
ingly
unavoidably
ever
however
gently
alone
away
gently
alone
frantically
quite
still
immediately
evidently
less
away
probably
even
fully
indeed
Here
unfriendly
probably
quite
almost
probably
surely
closer
fondly
hardly
never
pleadingly
angrily
imperiously
methodically
gently
gravely
Probably
piciously
scornfully
pretty
almost
enough
meditatively
Perhaps
better
Certainly
volubly
never
furiously
back
quietly
back
eagerly
kindly
almost
hard
softly
Not
presently
slowly
away
quickly
however
almost
quite
briskly
curiously
brutally
sturdily
alone
soon
back
long
long
Well
along
always
always
Well
never
never
patiently
furiously
almost
modestly
Then
ately
away
long
first
best
So
back
back
later
forward
ago
Here
Only
apologetically
never
Not
quickly
always
quietly
perfunctorily
Then
urgently
immediately
away
So
lightly
never
quite
quietly
almost
quite
stoutly
enough
simply
ever
neatly
fairly
proudly
away
positively
Quite
absolutely
even
far
urgently
Adelaide
Then
ill
quite
yet
As
soon
away
Bitterly
ately
gently
Just
close
much
gleams
lately
pathetically
Yet
pathologically
lately
heavily
passionately
never
never
even
even
enough
Then
Still
Then
enough
never
Never
never
never
nearly
surely
Adelaide
wearily
merely
mad
yet
Here
back
forward
still
better
merely
daily
pletely
perhaps
well
seldom
never
humanly
thoroughly
freely
fessionally
suddenly
Then
really
slightly
humbly
aside
far
nervously
later
carefully
sharply
suddenly
suddenly
far
perfectly
steadily
Then
deliberately
beside
long
aside
savagely
back
even
forward
Then

never
Then
