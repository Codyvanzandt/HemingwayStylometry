and
,
much
against
the
grain
,
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
devote
a
few
years
to
setting
straight
those
``
domestic
circumstances
,
''
thanks
to
which
he
found
himself
in
the
wilds
of
the
country
.
Vyazovnin
found
his
estate
in
disorder
,
his
fields
and
gardens
run
to
waste
,
his
house
al-
most
in
ruins
.
He
appointed
a
new
village
elder
and
diminished
the
allowances
of
the
house
serfs
.
He
had
two
or
three
rooms
cleared
for
his
own
use
and
ordered
new
shingles
to
be
put
on
where
the
roof
leaked
.
He
did
not
,
how-
ever
,
take
any
violent
measures
,
and
did
not
de-
I'ise
any
improvements
,
in
consequence
appar-
ently
of
the
simple
reflection
that
one
must
,
at
any
rate
,
just
find
out
what
one
wants
to
im-
prove
.
...
So
he
set
to
work
to
understand
the
farming
of
the
land
,
began
,
as
they
say
,
to
go
into
things
.
It
must
be
admitted
that
he
went
into
things
without
any
special
zeal
and
without
haste
.
Being
unaccustomed
to
country
life
,
he
found
it
very
dreary
,
and
often
could
not
think
where
and
how
to
spend
the
livelong
day
.
He
had
a
good
number
of
neighbours
but
he
was
not
acquainted
with
them
,
not
be-
cause
he
avoided
them
but
because
he
had
not
happened
to
come
into
contact
with
them
.
But
at
last
in
the
autumn
he
did
make
the
acquaint-
ance
of
one
of
his
nearest
neighbours
whose
name
was
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Krupitsyn
.
He
had
once
served
in
the
cavalry
and
had
left
the
army
a
Lieutenant
.
His
peasants
and
Vyazov-
nin
's
had
had
a
dispute
from
time
immemorial
concerning
seven
acres
of
mowing
land
.
The
quarrel
from
time
to
time
reached
the
point
pf
fighting
;
cocks
of
hay
were
mysteriously
transferred
from
place
to
place
,
all
sorts
of
unpleasant
incidents
occurred
,
and
most
likely
the
quarrel
would
have
gone
on
for
many
years
longer
,
if
Krupitsyn
,
hearing
by
chance
of
Boris
Andreyitch
's
peaceable
disposition
,
had
not
gone
to
him
to
discuss
the
matter
in
person
.
The
interview
had
very
agreeable
results
;
in
the
first
place
,
the
trouble
was
settled
at
once
and
for
ever
to
the
mutual
satisfaction
of
the
land-
owners
,
and
in
the
second
place
they
were
at-
tracted
by
each
other
,
took
to
meeting
fre-
quently
,
and
by
the
winter
had
become
such
friends
that
they
were
almost
inseparable
.
And
yet
they
had
little
in
common
.
Vyazov-
nin
,
who
had
come
of
wealthy
parents
though
he
was
not
himself
wealthy
,
had
received
a
good
education
,
studied
at
the
University
,
knew
several
languages
,
was
fond
of
reading
and
al-
together
might
be
regarded
as
a
man
of
culture
.
Krupitsyn
,
on
the
contrary
,
spoke
French
bad-
ly
,
never
took
up
a
book
unless
he
was
obliged
,
and
belonged
rather
to
the
class
of
the
uncul-
tivated
.
The
friends
had
little
resemblance
in
appearance
either
:
Vyazovnin
was
rather
tall
,
thin
,
fair
and
like
an
Englishman
;
he
kept
his
person
,
especially
his
hands
,
faultlessly
clean
,
was
elegant
in
his
dress
and
foppish
over
his
cravats
...
all
habits
formed
in
the
capital
!
Krupitsyn
on
the
other
hand
was
black-haired
and
dark-skinned
,
short
and
stooping
,
and
he
went
about
summer
and
winter
alike
in
a
sort
of
sack
overcoat
of
bronze-coloured
cloth
with
gaping
,
bulging
pockets
.
``
I
like
the
colour
,
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
used
to
say
,
``
because
it
does
n't
show
the
dirt
.
''
The
colour
of
the
cloth
certainly
did
not
show
the
dirt
but
the
cloth
itself
was
pretty
grimy
,
Vyazovnin
liked
dainty
fare
and
talked
with
zest
of
the
charms
of
good
dinners
,
and
the
importance
of
taste
;
Krupitsyn
ate
anything
that
was
given
him
,
so
long
as
it
was
something
he
could
work
upon
.
If
he
came
across
cab-
bage
soup
with
boiled
grain
he
swallowed
the
soup
with
pleasure
and
ate
up
the
grain
that
went
with
it
;
if
he
were
offered
German
clear
soup
he
would
fall
upon
it
with
the
same
readi-
ness
and
if
any
boiled
grain
were
at
hand
he
would
toss
it
into
the
same
plate
and
think
it
was
all
right
.
He
loved
kvass
,
to
use
his
own
expression
,
``
like
his
own
father
,
''
while
French
wines
,
especially
the
red
ones
,
he
could
not
endure
,
calling
them
``
vinegar
.
''
Altogether
Krupitsyn
was
very
far
from
being
fastidious
while
Vyazovnin
took
a
clean
handkerchief
twice
a
day
.
In
short
,
the
friends
,
as
we
have
said
already
,
were
not
alike
.
One
thing
they
had
in
common
:
they
were
both
what
is
called
''
good
fellows
,
''
straightforward
,
good-natured
young
men
.
Krupitsyn
had
been
born
one
,
while
Vyazovnin
had
become
one
.
Moreover
they
were
both
further
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
they
were
not
fond
of
anything
in
par-
ticular
;
that
is
,
that
they
had
no
special
passion
or
predilection
for
anything
.
Krupitsyn
was
six
or
eight
years
older
than
Vyazovnin
.
Their
days
were
spent
rather
monotonously
.
As
a
rule
,
in
the
morning
,
not
very
early
,
how-
ever
,
only
about
ten
o'clock
,
Boris
Andreyitch
would
be
sitting
,
with
a
book
and
a
cup
of
tea
,
by
the
window
,
combed
and
washed
,
in
a
hand-
some
dressing-gown
hanging
open
unbuttoned
and
a
snow-white
shirt
;
the
door
would
open
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
in
his
usual
careless
at-
tire
would
come
in
.
His
little
estate
was
less
than
half
a
mile
from
Vyazovno
(
as
Boris
Andreyitch
's
estate
was
called
)
,
though
indeed
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
very
often
stay
the
night
at
Boris
Andreyitch
's
.
``
Ah
,
good-morning
,
''
they
would
both
say
simultaneously
,
``
how
did
you
sleep
?
''
And
at
that
point
Fedyushka
,
a
boy
of
fif-
teen
dressed
like
a
Cossack
,
whose
very
hair
,
bristling
like
the
feathers
of
a
ruff
in
the
mat-
ing
season
,
looked
drowsy
,
would
bring
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
his
dressing-gown
of
Bokhara
stuff
,
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
after
clearing
his
throat
as
a
preliminary
,
would
swathe
himself
in
it
and
set
to
his
tea
and
his
pipe
.
Then
talk
would
begin
,
talk
without
haste
,
with
intervals
and
pauses
:
they
talked
of
the
weather
,
of
yesterday
,
of
the
work
of
the
fields
and
the
price
of
com
;
they
talked
,
too
,
of
the
neighbouring
landowners
and
their
ladies
.
In
the
early
days
of
his
acquaintance
with
Boris
Andreyitch
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
had
thought
it
his
duty
,
and
had
indeed
been
glad
of
the
op-
portunity
,
to
question
his
neighbour
concerning
life
in
the
capital
,
and
learning
and
culture
generally
in
fact
concerning
lofty
subjects
:
Boris
Andreyitch
's
replies
had
interested
him
,
often
surprised
him
,
and
held
his
attention
,
but
at
the
same
time
they
had
brought
on
a
cer-
tain
fatigue
,
so
that
all
such
conversations
were
quickly
dropped
;
and
indeed
Boris
Andreyitch
himself
displayed
no
excessive
desire
to
renew
them
.
It
happened
later
on
,
though
not
often
,
that
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
suddenly
ask
Boris
Andreyitch
,
for
example
,
what
sort
of
thing
the
electric
telegraph
was
,
and
after
listening
to
Boris
Andreyitch
's
not
perfectly
clear
ex-
planation
,
would
sit
silent
for
a
little
,
and
then
say
:
''
Yes
,
that
's
wonderful
,
''
and
wou
!
d
make
no
enquiry
concerning
a
scientific
subject
for
a
long
time
afterwards
.
For
the
most
part
conversations
between
them
were
after
the
following
style
.
Pyotr
A'assilyitch
would
inhale
the
smoke
from
his
pipe
and
puffing
it
out
through
his
nostrils
would
ask
:
''
What
's
that
new
girl
you
've
got
?
I
saw
her
on
the
back
stairs
,
Boris
Andreyitch
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
in
his
turn
would
put
his
cigar
to
his
lips
,
take
two
puffs
at
it
,
and
after
a
sip
of
cold
tea
with
cream
would
bring
out
:
''
What
new
girl
?
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
bend
down
a
little
to
one
side
and
looking
out
of
the
window
into
the
yard
where
the
dog
had
just
bitten
a
bare-
foot
boy
in
the
calf
of
the
leg
would
reply
:
''
Fair-haired
.
.
,
not
bad
looking
.
''
``
Ah
!
''
Boris
Andreyitch
would
exclaim
,
after
a
pause
,
``
that
's
my
new
laundry
girl
.
''
``
Where
does
she
come
from
?
''
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
would
ask
as
though
surprised
.
``
From
Moscow
.
She
's
been
training
there
.
''
And
both
would
sit
silent
for
a
while
.
``
How
many
laundry
girls
have
you
got
al-
together
,
Boris
Andreyitch
?
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
asks
again
,
looking
attentively
at
the
tobacco
burning
with
a
dry
splutter
under
the
charred
ash
in
his
pipe
.
``
Three
,
''
answers
Boris
Andreyitch
,
''
Three
!
I
've
only
one
and
there
's
scarcely
anything
for
the
one
to
do
;
of
course
,
as
you
know
,
we
do
n't
have
a
great
deal
of
washing
!
''
``
H
'm
!
''
answers
Boris
Andrtyitch
,
and
the
conversation
drops
for
a
time
.
The
morning
would
pass
in
such
occupations
and
lunch
time
would
arrive
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
particularly
fond
of
lunch
,
and
declared
that
twelve
o'clock
was
precisely
the
time
when
a
man
was
hungry
;
and
indeed
he
ate
at
that
hour
so
cheerfully
,
with
such
a
pleasant
and
hearty
appetite
,
that
even
a
German
would
have
been
delighted
looking
at
him
:
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
lunched
so
gloriously
!
Boris
Andrey^
itch
ate
far
less
:
he
was
satisfied
with
a
cro-
quette
of
chicken
or
a
couple
of
scrambled
eggs
with
butter
and
some
English
sauce
in
an
ingeniously
made
patent
jar
for
which
he
had
paid
a
great
deal
of
money
and
which
he
secretly
thought
disgusting
,
though
he
declared
that
he
could
not
touch
anything
without
it
.
If
the
weather
were
fine
the
two
friends
would
spend
the
time
between
lunch
and
dinner
look-
ing
after
farming
operations
,
or
would
simply
go
for
a
walk
,
or
look
at
young
horses
being
broken
in
,
etc
.
Sometimes
they
made
their
way
as
far
as
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
estate
and
occa-
sionally
went
into
his
little
house
.
The
house
,
small
and
very
old
,
was
more
like
a
plain
house-serf
's
cottage
than
a
land-
owner
's
residence
.
Green
moss
grew
in
the
thatched
roof
which
was
honeycombed
with
the
nests
of
sparrows
and
jackdaws
.
One
of
the
aspen
log
walls
,
which
had
originally
been
tightly
fitted
,
had
dropped
back
while
the
others
had
shifted
to
one
side
and
sunk
into
the
earth
in
short
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
house
was
poor
without
and
poor
within
.
But
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
not
depressed
by
that
;
being
a
bachelor
and
generally
unexact-
ing
he
cared
little
about
the
conveniences
of
life
,
and
was
satisfied
with
the
fact
that
he
had
a
little
place
in
which
he
could
at
need
find
shelter
from
cold
and
bad
weather
.
His
house
was
managed
by
the
housekeeper
,
Makedonia
,
a
middle-aged
woman
,
very
zealous
and
even
honest
but
with
an
unlucky
hand
;
nothing
she
did
succeeded
the
crockery
was
broken
,
the
linen
was
torn
,
the
food
was
uncooked
or
burnt
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
used
to
call
her
Caligula
.
,
,
,
.
Having
a
natural
bent
for
hospitality
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
liked
to
have
visitors
in
his
house
and
to
regale
them
in
spite
of
the
narrowness
of
his
means
.
He
was
particularly
active
in
his
efforts
when
Boris
Andreyitch
visited
him
,
but
thanks
to
Makedonia
,
who
almost
flew
off
her
legs
at
each
step
in
her
eagerness
to
please
,
poor
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
festive
fare
was
al-
ways
a
failure
,
and
for
the
most
part
did
not
get
further
than
a
piece
of
stale
dried
sturgeon
and
a
glass
of
vodka
which
he
himself
de-
scribed
very
justly
when
he
said
that
it
was
''
capital
against
the
stomach
.
''
After
their
walk
the
two
friends
would
return
to
Boris
Andrey-
itch
's
house
and
dine
in
leisurely
fashion
.
After
eating
as
though
he
had
had
no
lunch
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
retire
to
some
secluded
nook
and
sleep
for
two
or
three
hours
,
while
Boris
Andreyitch
would
read
foreign
magazines
.
In
II
the
evening
the
friends
met
again
,
so
great
was
their
friendship
.
Sometimes
they
sat
down
to
play
preference
,
sometimes
they
simply
talked
as
in
the
morning
.
Occasionally
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
would
take
a
guitar
from
the
wall
and
sing
in
a
rather
agreeable
tenor
.
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
was
very
fond
of
music
,
far
more
so
than
Boris
Andreyitch
,
though
the
latter
could
not
utter
the
name
of
Beethoven
without
a
dis-
play
of
enthusiasm
and
was
always
intending
to
order
a
piano
from
Moscow
.
In
moments
of
melancholy
or
depression
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
had
the
habit
of
singing
a
song
connected
with
the
period
of
his
service
in
the
regiment
.
.
.
.
With
peculiar
feeling
and
a
little
through
his
nose
,
he
would
deliver
the
following
verse
:
''
No
Frenchman
ever
cooks
for
us
;
A
soldier
gets
our
meals
for
us
.
No
glorious
Rodez
playo
for
us
;
No
Catalini
sings
for
us
.
A
bugler
greets
the
dawn
for
us
,
A
sergeant
brings
reports
to
us
.
''
.
.
.
Boris
Andreyitch
would
sometimes
second
him
,
but
his
voice
was
disagreeable
and
not
always
in
tune
.
At
ten
o'clock
,
and
sometimes
earlier
,
the
friends
parted
.
.
.
.
And
the
same
thing
began
again
next
day
.
Sitting
one
day
as
usual
,
a
little
on
one
side
facing
Boris
Andreyitch
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
looked
at
him
rather
intently
and
brought
out
in
a
dreamy
voice
:
''
There
's
one
thing
I
wonder
at
,
Boris
An-
dreyitch
.
''
``
What
's
that
?
''
inquired
the
latter
.
``
Why
,
this
.
You
're
young
,
intelligent
,
well-
educated
.
What
induces
you
to
live
in
the
country
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
at
his
neighbour
in
surprise
.
``
Why
,
you
know
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
'
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
that
if
it
were
not
for
my
circum-
stances
.
.
.
circumstances
compel
me
to
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitcli
.
''
``
Circumstances
.
Your
circumstances
are
nothing
to
matter
so
far
.
.
.
.
With
your
estate
you
can
get
along
all
right
.
You
should
go
into
the
service
.
''
And
after
a
brief
pause
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
added
:
``
If
I
were
you
I
should
go
into
the
Uhlans
.
''
``
The
Uhlans
?
Why
into
the
Uhlans
?
''
^3
''
Oh
,
I
fancy
it
would
be
more
suitable
for
you
to
be
in
the
Uhlans
,
''
''
But
excuse
me
,
you
were
in
the
Hussars
,
were
n't
you
?
''
``
I
?
Of
course'I
was
in
the
Hussars
,
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
said
eagerly
.
``
And
in
what
a
regi-
ment
!
You
.
would
n't
find
another
regiment
like
it
in
the
whole
world
!
It
was
a
golden
regiment
!
My
superior
officers
,
my
comrades
what
fellows
they
were
!
But
you
,
I
don't
know
.
.
.
.
You
ought
to
be
in
Hie
Uhlans
,
to
my
thinking
.
You
're
fair
,
you
've
a
slim
fig-
ure
,
it
's
all
in
keeping
.
''
``
But
excuse
me
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
You
forget
that
by
the
Army
regulations
I
should
have
to
begin
as
an
Ensign
.
At
my
age
that
would
be
rather
difficult
.
I
think
it
's
forbidden
,
in
fact
.
''
``
That
's
true
,
''
observed
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
and
he
became
downcast
.
``
Well
,
in
that
case
you
should
get
married
,
''
he
pronounced
,
sud-
denly
raising
his
head
.
``
What
queer
ideas
you
've
got
to-day
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
''
exclaimed
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
WTiy
queer
?
What
's
the
use
of
living
like
this
really
?
What
are
you
waiting
for
?
You're
only
losing
lime
.
I
want
to
know
what
ad-
vantage
it
will
be
to
you
not
to
get
married
!
''
``
But
it
's
not
a
question
of
advantage
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
was
beginning
.
``
No
,
excuse
me
,
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
inter-
rupted
him
,
suddenly
growing
excited
.
``
I
can't
understand
why
it
is
young
men
are
so
afraid
to
be
married
nowadays
!
I
simply
ca
n't
under-
stand
it
.
Never
mind
my
not
being
married
,
Boris
Andreyitch
.
I
wanted
to
be
perhaps
and
made
an
offer
,
but
they
showed
me
out
,
''
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
pointed
upwards
and
out-
wards
with
the
finger
of
his
right
hand
towards
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
But
with
your
property
how
is
it
you
're
not
married
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
intently
at
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
``
Is
it
amusing
to
live
as
a
bachelor
?
''
Pyoti
Vassilyitch
went
on
.
``
It
's
nothing
to
boast
of
!
It
's
a
poor
sort
of
fun
!
Really
the
young
men
of
to-day
are
a
wonder
to
me
.
''
And
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
knocked
his
pipe
against
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
an
air
of
vexation
and
blew
violently
into
the
mouthpiece
.
``
But
who
has
told
you
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
that
I
do
n't
intend
to
get
married
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
brought
out
slowly
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
remained
motionless
,
as
he
was
,
with
his
fingers
in
his
spangled
maroon
velvet
tobacco
pouch
.
Boris
Andreyitch
's
v
;
ords
astonished
him
.
``
Yes
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
went
on
,
``
I
'm
ready
to
be
married
.
Find
me
a
bride
and
I
'll
marry
.
''
``
Really
?
''
``
Really
.
''
``
No
,
I
say
,
upon
your
word
?
''
``
What
a
fellow
you
are
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
!
Upon
my
word
I
'm
not
joking
.
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
filled
his
pipe
.
``
Well
you
shall
see
then
,
Boris
Andreyitch
.
We
'll
find
you
a
bride
.
''
``
Very
good
,
''
replied
Boris
Andreyitch
,
``
but
tell
me
really
what
do
you
want
to
marry
me
for
?
''
``
Why
because
,
as
I
told
you
,
you
're
not
fitted
for
doing
nothing
hke
this
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
smiled
.
i6
''
It
has
always
seemed
to
me
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
I
was
a
master
at
it
.
''
``
You
misunderstand
me
,
''
said
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
,
and
he
changed
the
conversation
.
Two
days
later
Pyotr
Vassilyitch*
arrived
at
his
neighbour
's
not
in
his
usual
sack
overcoat
,
but
in
a
frock-coat
,
the
colour
of
a
raven's
wing
,
with
a
high
waist
,
minute
buttons
and
long
sleeves
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
moustaches
looked
almost
black
from
wax
,
and
his
hair
,
curled
tightly
in
front
in
the
form
of
two
long
sausages
,
glistened
with
pomatum
.
A
big
velvet
cravat
with
a
satin
ribbon
tightly
compressed
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
neck
and
gave
a
solemn
im-
mobility
and
festive
dignity
to
the
whole
of
the
upper
part
of
his
person
.
``
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
get-up
?
''
en-
quired
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
The
meaning
of
this
get-up
,
''
replied
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
sinking
into
an
armchair
,
but
not
with
his
usual
carelessness
,
``
is
that
you
must
order
the
carriage
;
we
are
going
out
.
''
``
Whereto
?
''
``
To
see
the
bride
.
''
``
What
bride
?
''
``
Why
,
have
you
forgotten
already
what
we
were
talking
about
three
days
ago
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
laughed
,
though
he
was
in-
wardly
disturbed
.
``
Upon
my
word
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
why
,
that
was
only
a
joke
.
''
``
A
joke
?
How
was
it
then
that
you
swore
at
the
time
that
you
were
not
joking
?
No
,
ex-
cuse
me
,
Boris
Andreyitch
,
you
must
keep
your
word
.
I
've
taken
steps
already
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
was
still
more
disturbed
.
'/What
steps
do
you
mean
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Oh
,
do
n't
worry
yourself
.
.
.
.
What
do
you
imagine
!
I
have
only
warned
a
neighbour
of
ours
,
a
very
charming
lady
,
that
we
intend
to
call
on
her
to-day
.
''
``
Who
is
this
neighbour
?
''
``
Wait
a
bit
and
you
will
know
.
Come
,
you
must
first
dress
and
order
the
horses
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
round
him
irreso-
lutely
.
``
Really
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
what
possessed
you
!
.
.
.
Look
at
the
weather
.
''
``
The
weather
does
n't
matter
;
it
's
always
like
that
.
''
i8
''
And
is
it
far
to
drive
?
''
``
About
ten
miles
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
was
silent
.
``
But
let
us
at
least
have
lunch
first
!
''
``
Lunch
,
certainly
,
if
you
like
.
Do
you
know
what
;
you
run
and
dress
now
.
I
'll
arrange
it
all
while
you
are
gone
:
a
drop
of
vodka
,
a
morsel
of
caviare
,
and
we
shall
be
fed
at
the
little
widow
's
.
You
need
n't
be
anxious
about
that
.
''
``
You
do
n't
say
she
's
a
widow
?
''
Boris
An-
dreyitch
asked
,
turning
round
on
his
way
to
the
door
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
shook
his
head
.
``
There
,
you
will
see
,
you
will
see
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
went
out
and
shut
the
door
after
him
,
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
left
alone
,
ordered
the
lunch
and
the
carriage
.
Boris
Andreyitch
spent
a
considerable
time
over
his
toilet
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
with
a
slight
frown
and
a
melancholy
air
,
was
already
drink-
ing
his
second
glass
of
vodka
when
Boris
Andreyitch
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
study
.
He
had
taken
trouble
over
dressing
.
He
had
put
on
a
full
fashionably
cut
black
frock-coat
,
the
dark
mass
of
which
contrasted
agreeably
with
the
faint
brilliance
of
the
light-grey
trou-
sers
,
a
low
black
cravat
,
and
a
handsome
dark-
blue
waistcoat
;
a
gold
chain
hooked
into
the
lowest
buttonhole
modestly
vanished
into
the
side
pocket
;
the
thin
high
boots
creaked
in
a
gentlemanly
way
,
and
at
Boris
Andreyitch's
entrance
the
air
was
filled
with
a
scent
of
Ess
bouquet
combined
with
the
smell
of
fresh
linen
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
could
only
articulate
``
Ah
!
''
and
pick
up
his
cap
.
Boris
And
rey
itch
drew
a
grey
kid
glove
on
to
his
left
hand
,
after
first
blowing
into
it
;
then
with
the
same
hand
he
nervously
poured
himself
out
a
quarter
of
a
glass
of
vodka
and
drank
it
off
;
than
he
took
his
hat
and
went
with
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
out
into
the
entry
.
``
I
'm
doing
this
entirely
on
your
account
,
''
said
Boris
Andreyitch
,
as
he
got
into
the
car-
riage
.
``
Supposing
it
is
on
my
account
,
''
said
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
who
was
evidently
impressed
by
Boris
Andreyitch
's
elegant
appearance
;
``
you
will
perhaps
thank
me
for
it
yourself
.
''
And
he
told
the
coachman
where
to
drive
and
how
to
get
there
.
The
carriage
drove
off
.
``
We
are
going
to
see
Sofya
Kirillovna
Zad-
nyeprovskoy
,
''
observed
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
after
a
rather
prolonged
interval
,
in
the
course
of
which
the
two
friends
had
sat
motionless
as
though
turned
to
stone
.
``
Have
you
heard
of
her
?
''
!
``
I
believe
I
have
,
''
answered
Boris
Andrey-
itch
.
``
Why
,
have
you
chosen
her
for
a
bride
for
me
?
''
``
And
why
not
?
She
is
a
woman
of
excel-
lent
understanding
,
with
property
,
with
the
manners
,
one
may
say
,
of
Petersburg
.
But
you
can
have
a
look
at
her
.
That
does
n't
bind
you
to
anything
,
you
know
.
''
``
I
should
hope
not
,
''
retorted
Boris
Andrey-
itch
,
``
and
how
old
is
she
?
''
``
Twenty-five
or
seven
,
not
more
;
in
her
very
prime
,
as
they
say
!
''
It
was
not
ten
miles
to
Madame
Zadnyeprov-
skoy
's
but
a
good
sixteen
and
a
half
,
so
that
Boris
Andreyitch
was
fairly
frozen
by
the
end
of
the
drive
and
kept
hiding
his
reddening
nose
in
the
beaver
collar
of
his
greatcoat
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
not
afraid
of
cold
as
a
rule
and
especially
not
so
when
he
was
dressed
in
his
holiday
dress
,
then
he
was
more
liable
to
get
into
a
perspiration
.
Madame
Zad-
nyeprovskoy
's
homestead
consisted
of
a
little
new
white
house
with
a
green
roof
of
suburban
style
that
looked
like
a
summer
villa
,
and
a
little
garden
and
courtyard
.
Such
villas
may
frequently
be
met
with
near
Moscow
;
in
the
provinces
they
are
not
so
common
.
It
was
evi-
dent
that
the
lady
had
settled
here
only
re-
cently
.
The
friends
got
out
of
the
carriage
.
They
were
met
on
the
steps
by
a
footman
in
pea-green
trousers
and
a
grey
swallowtail
coat
with
rounded
edges
and
buttons
with
a
crest
on
them
;
in
the
entry
,
which
was
fairly
neat
though
it
had
a
box
seat
in
it
,
they
were
met
by
another
similar
footman
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
bade
him
take
his
name
and
Boris
Andreyitch's
to
his
mistress
.
The
footman
did
not
go
to
his
mistress
,
but
answered
that
he
had
orders
to
show
them
in
.
They
went
in
and
through
a
dining-room
in
which
a
canary
was
singing
in
a
deafening
way
,
walked
into
a
drawing-room
full
of
fashionable
Russian
shop-made
furniture
,
very
ingeniously
constructed
.and
with
chairs
bent
in
all
direc-
tions
to
provide
comfort
for
the
sitter
and
really
very
uncomfortable
.
Two
minutes
had
not
elapsed
when
the
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
was
heard
in
the
next
room
;
the
curtain
over
the
door
was
raised
and
the
lady
of
the
house
walked
with
rapid
steps
into
the
drawing-room
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
made
a
bow
and
a
scrape
and
introduced
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
I
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
have
long
wished
to
,
''
the
lady
responded
in
a
free-and-easy
tone
,
scanning
him
with
a
rapid
glance
.
``
I
am
very
grateful
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
for
bringing
me
such
an
agreeable
acquaintance
;
please
sit
down
.
''
And
with
a
rustle
of
her
skirts
the
lady
sat
down
on
a
little
low
sofa
,
leaned
back
in
it
,
stretched
out
her
feet
in
charming
little
boots
and
folded
her
arms
.
Her
dress
was
of
green
glace
silk
with
whitish
lights
on
it
,
made
with
several
rows
of
flounces
.
Boris
Andreyitch
sat
down
on
the
low
chair
facing
her
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
a
little
further
away
.
Conversation
followed
.
Boris
Andrey-
itch
scrutinised
Sofya
Kirillovna
attentively
.
She
was
a
tall
,
well
made
woman
,
with
a
sUm
waist
,
dark
and
rather
handsome
.
The
ex-
pression
of
her
face
,
and
particularly
of
her
big
and
shining
eyes
turned
up
at
the
corners
like
a
Chinaman
's
,
betrayed
a
strange
mixture
of
boldness
and
timidity
and
could
not
have
been
called
natural
.
She
would
screw
up
her
eyes
and
then
suddenly
open
them
wide
;
a
smile
which
tried
to
seem
careless
was
continually
playing
on
her
lips
,
All
Sofya
Kirillovna's
movements
were
very
free
,
almost
abrupt
.
Her
appearance
attracted
Boris
Andreyitch
,
how-
ever
,
except
that
he
was
disagreeably
impressed
by
the
way
her
hair
was
parted
on
one
side
,
which
gave
a
saucy
and
boyish
air
to
her
face
;
moreover
,
to
his
thinking
she
spoke
Russian
with
excessive
purity
and
correctness
,
.
.
.
Boris
Andreyitch
shared
Pushkin
's
opinion
that
one
can
no
more
love
the
Russian
language
without
a
grammatical
mistake
than
rosy
lips
without
a
smile
.
In
short
,
Sofya
Kirillovna
belonged
to
that
class
of
women
who
are
spoken
of
by
polite
men
as
``
ladies
who
can
hold
their
own
,
''
by
husbands
as
``
formidable
women
,
''
and
by
old
bachelors
as
``
festive
old
girls
.
''
At
first
the
conversation
touched
upon
the
extreme
dullness
of
country
life
.
``
There
's
simply
not
a
living
soul
here
,
sim-
ply
no
one
to
say
a
word
to
,
''
said
Sofya
Kiril-
lovna
,
pronouncing
the
letter
``
s
''
with
peculiar
distinctness
.
``
I
ca
n't
make
out
the
people
liv-
ing
here
,
and
those
,
''
she
added
with
a
grimace
,
'with
whom
it
would
be
pleasant
to
be
ac-
quainted
,
they
do
n't
call
,
they
leave
us
poor
things
to
our
cheerless
solitude
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
made
a
slight
bow
and
mut-
tered
some
awkward
apology
while
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
merely
glanced
at
him
as
though
to
say
:
''
Well
,
what
did
I
tell
you
?
She
's
not
at
a
Toss
for
a
word
,
you
see
.
''
``
Do
you
smoke
?
''
asked
Sofya
Kirillovna
.
``
Yes
.
...
But
.
.
.
''
``
Please
do
.
I
smoke
myself
,
''
And
as
she
said
these
words
the
widow
took
a
rather
large
silver
cigar
case
from
the
little
table
,
took
a
cigarette
from
it
and
offered
it
to
her
guests
.
Each
took
a
cigarette
.
Sofya
Kirillovna
rang
.^
the
bell
and
told
a
boy
with
a
broad
expanse
of
red
waistcoat
to
bring
a
light
.
The
boy
brought
a
wax
candle
on
a
crystal
tray
.
The
cigarettes
were
lighted
.
``
Now
,
for
instance
,
you
would
n't
believe
,
''
the
widow
went
on
lightly
,
turning
her
head
and
puffing
a
thin
coil
of
smoke
upwards
,
``
there
are
people
here
who
think
ladies
ought
n't
to
smoke
,
and
as
for
riding
on
horseback
,
God
forbid
!
They
would
simply
stone
one
.
Yes
,
''
she
added
after
a
brief
pause
,
``
anything
that
departs
from
the
common
level
,
everything
that
breaks
the
rules
of
an
artificial
decorum
,
is
sub-
jected
to
the
severest
censure
here
.
''
``
The
young
ladies
in
particular
are
angry
about
that
,
''
observed
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
widow
.
``
They
are
the
chief
sufferers
!
I
do
n't
know
them
at
all
,
though
:
scandal
wo
n't
allow
them
to
visit
my
solitary
retreat
.
''
``
And
are
n't
you
dull
?
''
asked
Boris
Andrey-
itch
.
``
Dull
?
No
,
I
read
.
.
.
.
And
when
I'm
tired
of
books
I
dream
,
I
tell
my
future
and
put
questions
to
my
fate
.
''
``
You
tell
your
fortune
on
cards
?
''
asked
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
The
widow
gave
a
condescending
smile
.
``
Why
should
n't
I
tell
my
fortune
?
I
'm
old
enough
for
that
.
''
``
Oh
,
what
next
!
''
retorted
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
Sofya
Kirillovna
screwed
up
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
.
``
Let
us
drop
that
subject
,
though
,
''
she
said
,
and
turned
with
alacrity
to
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
Listen
,
Monsieur
Vyazovnin
.
I
am
con*
vinced
that
you
are
interested
in
Russian
litera-
ture
?
''
``
Yes
.
...
Of
course
.
.
.
.
''
Vyazovnin
was
fond
of
reading
,
but
he
had
read
little
in
Russian
and
without
interest
.
The
more
modern
literature
especially
was
unknown
to
him
;
he
had
stopped
at
Pushkiti
.
``
Tell
me
,
please
,
why
has
Marlinsky
fallen
into
such
disfavour
of
late
?
To
my
thinking
it
's
extremely
unjust
;
what
is
your
view
of
him
?
''
``
Marlinsky
is
a
writer
of
merit
of
course
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
replied
.
``
He
is
a
poet
;
he
carries
the
imagination
away
into
a
world
of
enchantment
and
marvels
;
but
of
late
they
've
taken
to
describing
every-
day
life
,
and
upon
my
word
,
what
good
is
tViere
in
this
everyday
life
here
on
earth
?
.
.
.
''
And
Sofya
Kirillovna
waved
her
hand
round
her
.
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
significantly
at
Sofya
Kirillovna
.
``
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
.
I
think
there
's
a
great
deal
that
's
good
just
here
,
''
he
said
,
with
peculiar
emphasis
on
the
last
word
.
Sofya
Kirillovna
suddenly
broke
into
an
ab-
rupt
laugh
,
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
as
suddenly
raised
his
head
,
thought
a
moment
,
and
fell
to
smoking
again
.
The
conversation
went
on
in
the
same
style
till
dinner
time
,
continually
changing
from
one
subject
to
another
,
which
does
not
happen
when
a
conversation
becomes
really
interesting
.
Amongst
other
things
they
touched
upon
mar-
riage
,
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
the
position
of
women
in
general
.
Sofya
Kiril-
lovna
vigorously
attacked
marriage
,
became
ex-
cited
at
last
,
and
,
beginning
to
feel
hot
,
ex-
pressed
herself
very
eloquently
,
though
her
listeners
scarcely
contradicted
her
;
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
she
loved
IMarlinsky
.
She
could
,
too
,
resort
on
occasion
to
the
fine
flowers
of
the
most
up-to-date
style
.
The
words
''
artistic
,
''
``
aestheticism
,
''
``
conditioned
by
''
were
continuously
dropping
from
her
lips
.
``
What
can
be
of
more
value
to
a
woman
than
freedom
?
freedom
of
thought
,
of
feeling
,
of
action
,
''
she
exclaimed
at
last
,
''
But
excuse
me
,
''
said
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
whose
face
was
beginning
to
assume
a
disatis-
fied
expression
,
``
what
does
woman
want
free-
dom
for
;
what
will
she
do
with
it
?
''
``
How
can
you
ask
'what
'
?
Why
,
a
man
wants
it
to
your
thinking
,
does
n't
he
?
To
be
sure
you
gentlemen
.
.
.
''
``
But
a
man
does
n't
want
it
either
,
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
interrupted
her
again
.
``
How
do
you
mean
does
n't
want
it
?
''
``
Wh
)
'
,
just
what
I
say
that
he
does
n't
.
What
use
to
a
man
is
the
freedom
you
praise
so
?
A
man
who
is
free
it
's
a
thing
we
all
know
is
either
bored
or
plays
the
fool
.
''
``
Then
,
''
observed
Sofya
Kirillovna
with
an
ironical
smile
,
``
you
are
bored
,
because
,
know-
ing
you
to
be
a
sensible
man
,
I
ca
n't
suppose
that
you
play
the
fool
,
as
you
say
.
''
``
Both
happen
,
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
answered
calmly
.
``
Well
,
that
's
charming
!
However
,
I
ought
to
be
grateful
to
your
boredom
for
giving
me
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
here
to-day
.
.
.
.
''
And
satisfied
with
the
tactful
turn
of
her
phrase
the
lady
sank
back
a
little
,
and
pro-
nounced
in
an
undertone
:
''
Your
friend
,
I
see
,
is
fond
of
paradoxes
,
Monsieur
Vyazovnin
.
''
``
I
have
n't
noticed
it
,
''
replied
Boris
Andrey-
itch
.
``
What
am
I
fond
of
?
''
asked
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
.
``
Paradoxes
.
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
looked
into
Sofya
Kiril-
lovna
's
eyes
and
m.ade
her
no
reply
but
thought
to
himself
:
``
I
know
what
you
're
fond
of
.
.
.
.
''
The
boy
with
the
red
waistcoat
came
in
and
announced
that
dinner
was
ready
.
``
Will
you
come
,
then
?
''
said
the
lady
,
get-
ting
up
from
the
sofa
,
and
they
all
went
into
the
dining-room
.
The
two
friends
did
not
like
the
dinner
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
hungry
when
he
rose
from
the
table
,
though
there
were
many
dishes
;
while
Boris
Andreyitch
,
who
was
fond
of
good
fare
,
was
dissatisfied
though
the
food
was
served
under
dish
covers
,
and
the
plates
had
been
heated
.
The
wines
,
too
,
were
poor
,
in
spite
of
the
magnificent
labels
,
adorned
with
gold
and
silver
,
on
the
bottles
.
Sofya
Kiril-
lovna
talked
without
ceasing
,
though
from
time
to
time
she
cast
expressive
glances
at
the
serv-
ants
who
were
handing
the
dishes
,
and
she
drank
a
fair
amount
of
wine
,
remarking
that
in
England
all
the
ladies
drank
wine
,
while
here
even
that
was
considered
improper
.
After
din-
ner
the
lady
invited
them
back
into
the
drawing-
room
,
and
asked
them
which
they
preferred
,
tea
or
coffee
.
Boris
Andreyitch
preferred
tea
,
and
after
emptying
his
cup
inwardly
regretted
that
he
had
not
asked
for
coffee
,
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
chose
coffee
,
and
after
emptying
it
asked
for
tea
,
tasted
it
and
put
the
cup
back
on
the
tray
.
The
lady
settled
herself
in
her
seat
,
lighted
a
cigarette
and
was
evidently
not
disinclined
to
enter
on
the
liveliest
conversation
:
her
eyes
glowed
and
her
dark
cheeks
w^ere
flushed
,
but
her
guests
responded
listlessly
to
her
sallies
,
were
more
absorbed
by
their
smoking
,
and
judg-
ing
from
the
looks
they
bent
on
the
corners
of
the
room
were
thinking
of
taking
leave
.
Boris
Andreyitch
,
however
,
would
probably
have
consented
to
stay
till
evening
:
he
had
just
entered
upon
a
skirmish
with
Sofya
Kiril-
lovna
on
her
asking
coquettishly
whether
he
was
not
surprised
at
her
living
alone
without
a
companion
,
but
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
unmis-
takably
in
a
hurry
to
go
home
.
.
He
got
up
,
went
out
into
the
entry
and
ordered
the
horses
.
When
at
last
the
two
friends
began
saying
good-bye
and
their
hostess
tried
to
keep
them
,
and
politely
upbraided
them
for
staying
so
short
a
time
,
Boris
Andreyitch
by
the
irresolute
in-
clination
of
his
person
and
the
simpering
ex-
pression
of
his
face
did
at
least
show
that
her
reproaches
had
some
effect
on
him
;
but
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
kept
muttering
``
quite
impossible
,
time
to
be
going
,
work
to
do
,
it
's
moonlight
now
,
''
and
obstinately
backed
towards
the
door
.
Sofya
Kirillovna
made
them
promise
,
however
,
THE
two
FRIENDS
that
they
would
come
again
in
a
few
days
and
held
out
her
hand
to
them
for
an
English
''
shake
hands
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
alone
availed
himself
of
the
offer
and
pressed
her
fingers
rather
warmly
.
She
screwed
up
her
eyes
and
smiled
.
At
that
instant
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
already
putting
on
his
greatcoat
in
the
entry
.
Before
the
carriage
had
driven
out
of
the
village
he
first
broke
the
silence
by
exclaiming
:
''
That
's
not
the
thing
,
not
the
thing
,
no
,
it
wo
n't
do
!
''
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
asked
him
.
``
It
's
not
the
thing
,
not
the
thing
,
''
repeated
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
looking
away
and
turning
a
little
aside
.
``
If
you
are
saying
that
about
Sofya
Kiril-
lovna
,
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
;
she
's
a
very
charming
lady
,
conceited
but
charming
.
''
``
I
should
think
so
!
Of
course
if
your
only
object
were
.
.
.
but
you
know
my
motive
in
wanting
to
make
you
acquainted
with
her
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
did
not
answer
.
``
Well
,
I
tell
you
she
's
not
right
!
I
see
that
myself
.
I
like
that
saying
about
herself
:
'I'm
an
epicure
.
'
Why
,
I
've
two
teeth
out
on
the
right
side
here
but
do
you
suppose
I
talk
about
it
?
And
anyone
can
see
that
without
my
saying
so
.
And
besides
she
's
a
nice
housekeeper
,
isn't
she
?
Why
,
she
has
almost
starved
me
to
death
.
No
.
What
I
think
is
,
be
free
and
easy
,
be
learned
if
you
have
a
turn
that
way
,
have
bon
ton
if
you
like
,
but
be
a
good
housekeeper
before
everything
.
No
,
she
wo
n't
do
,
she
won't
do
,
that
's
not
what
you
want
.
There
's
no
daz-
zling
you
with
those
red
waistcoats
and
night-
caps
over
the
dishes
.
''
``
But
do
you
want
me
to
be
dazzled
?
''
asked
Boris
Andrcyitch
.
``
Oh
,
I
know
what
you
want
,
I
know
.
''
``
I
assure
you
I
'm
grateful
to
you
for
intro
ducing
me
to
Sofya
Kirillovna
.
''
``
So
much
the
better
,
but
I
say
again
,
she
wo
n't
do
.
''
The
friends
arrived
home
late
.
As
he
was
leaving
Boris
Andreyitch
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
:
''
I
'm
not
going
to
let
you
off
though
,
I
'm
not
going
to
give
you
back
your
promise
.
''
``
Very
well
,
I
'm
at
your
service
,
''
replied
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
That
's
all
right
then
!
''
And
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
went
off
.
A
whole
week
passed
again
in
the
usuaJ
routine
with
the
only
difference
,
however
,
that
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
absent
for
a
whole
day
.
At
last
one
morning
he
appeared
again
dressed
in
his
holiday
best
,
and
again
proposed
to
Boris
Andreyitch
to
take
him
with
him
for
a
visit
.
Boris
Andreyitch
,
who
had
evidently
been
ex-
pecting
this
invitation
with
some
impatience
,
obeyed
without
protest
.
``
Where
are
you
taking
me
now
?
''
he
asked
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
as
he
sat
beside
him
in
the
sledge
.
Winter
had
set
in
since
their
expedition
to
Sofya
Kirillovna
's
.
``
I
'm
taking
you
now
,
''
answered
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
impressively
,
``
to
a
very
respectable
family
to
the
Tihoduevs
.
It
's
a
most
respect-
able
family
.
The
old
man
is
a
colonel
,
and
an
excellent
fellow
.
His
wife
is
an
excellent
lady
;
they
have
two
daughters
,
extremely
amiable
persons
,
very
well
educated
,
and
there
is
prop-
erty
.
I
do
n't
know
which
you
will
like
best
.
One
,
well
,
is
rather
livelier
,
the
other
is
quieter
;
the
other
,
I
confess
,
is
too
shy
,
but
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
both
of
them
.
Well
,
you
will
see
.
''
``
Very
well
,
I
will
see
,
''
replied
Boris
Andrey-
itch
,
and
thought
to
himself
:
``
Like
the
Larin
family
in
Onyegin
.
''
And
either
thanks
to
this
reminiscence
or
for
some
other
reason
,
his
features
assumed
an
ex-
pression
of
disillusionment
and
boredom
.
``
What
's
the
father
's
name
?
''
he
asked
cas-
ually
.
``
Kalimon
Ivanitch
,
''
answered
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
.
``
Kalimon
!
What
a
name
!
.
.
.
And
the
mother
?
''
``
The
mother
's
name
is
Pelageya
Ivanovna
.
''
``
And
the
daughters
'
names
?
''
``
One
is
Pelageya
too
,
and
the
other
is
Emerentsiya
.
''
``
I'.merentsiya
?
I
have
never
heard
such
a
name
in
my
life
.
.
.
.
And
Kalimon
too
.
.
.
''
``
Yes
,
the
name
certainly
is
rather
odd
.
Bui
what
a
girl
she
is
!
Simply
,
one
might
say
,
made
of
a
sort
of
virtuous
fire
!
''
``
Upon
my
soul
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
how
poet-
ically
you
express
yourself
.
But
which
of
them
is
Emerentsiya
^the
one
that
's
rather
quiet
?
''
``
No
,
the
other
.
.
.
.
But
there
,
you
'll
see
for
yourself
.
''
``
Emerentsiya
Kalimonovna
1
''
Vyazovnin
ex-
claimed
once
more
.
``
Her
mother
calls
her
Emerance
,
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
observed
in
an
undertone
.
``
And
does
she
call
her
husband
Calimon
?
''
``
That
I
have
n't
heard
,
but
there
,
wait
a
bit
.
''
``
Oh
,
ril
wait
.
''
To
the
Tihoduevs
'
it
was
a
drive
of
nearly
twenty
miles
,
as
it
had
been
to
Sofya
Kiril-
lovna
's
;
but
their
old-fashioned
house
was
not
in
the
least
like
the
jaunty
little
villa
of
the
free-and-easy
widow
.
It
was
a
clumsy
building
,
roomy
and
ram-
bling
,
a
mass
of
dark
beams
with
dark
panes
in
the
windows
.
Tall
birch-trees
stood
in
two
rows
on
each
side
;
the
dark-brown
tops
of
huge
lime-trees
could
be
seen
behind
the
roof
,
the
whole
house
seemed
overgrown
;
in
sum-
mer
all
this
vegetation
probably
brightened
up
the
place
,
in
winter
it
gave
it
a
still
more
dis-
Z7
consolate
aspect
.
The
impression
made
by
the
inside
of
the
house
could
not
be
called
cheering
either
:
everything
in
it
looked
gloomy
and
dingy
,
everything
looked
older
than
it
really
was
.
The
friends
sent
in
their
names
and
were
ushered
into
the
drawing-room
.
The
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
got
up
to
greet
them
,
but
for
a
long
time
could
only
welcome
them
by
signs
and
bodily
movements
,
to
which
the
guests
on
their
side
replied
only
by
signs
and
bows
,
such
a
deafening
barking
was
set
up
by
four
white
sheepdogs
who
on
the
appearance
of
strangers
bounded
up
from
the
embroidered
cushions
on
which
they
had
been
lying
.
In
one
way
and
another
,
by
flap-
ping
pocket-handkerchiefs
and
other
means
,
they
pacified
the
infuriated
curs
,
but
a
maid-
servant
was
obliged
to
drag
one
of
them
,
the
oldest
and
most
spiteful
,
from
under
a
seat
and
to
take
it
away
into
a
bedroom
,
getting
bitten
on
her
right
hand
in
the
process
.
When
silence
was
restored
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
took
advantage
of
it
to
introduce
Boris
An-
dreyitch
.
Monsieur
and
Madame
Tihoduev
sim-
ultaneously
declared
that
they
were
very
glad
to
meet
their
new
acquaintance
;
then
Kalimon
Ivanitch
introduced
his
daughters
,
calhng
them
Polinka
and
Eminka
.
There
were
two
other
persons
of
the
female
sex
,
no
longer
young
,
in
the
room
,
one
in
a
cap
and
the
other
in
a
dark
kerchief
;
but
Kalimon
Ivanitch
did
not
think
fit
to
introduce
Boris
Andreyitch
to
them
,
Kalimon
Ivanitch
was
a
tall
,
stoutly
built
,
grey-headed
man
of
about
five
and
fifty
;
his
face
expressed
nothing
in
particular
:
his
fea-
tures
were
plain
and
heavy
with
a
stamp
of
indifference
,
good
nature
and
indolence
upon
them
.
His
wife
,
a
thin
little
woman
,
with
a
little
face
that
looked
rather
the
worse
for
wear
and
a
front
of
reddish
hair
under
a
high
cap
,
seemed
in
continual
agitation
;
traces
of
bygone
affectation
could
be
detected
in
her
.
One
of
the
daughters
,
Pelageya
,
a
girl
with
dark
hair
and
a
swarthy
skit
)
,
looked
up
from
under
her
brows
and
was
wildly
shy
;
on
the
other
hand
,
Emerentsiya
,
a
fair-haired
,
plump
girl
witli
round
red
cheeks
,
with
a
little
pursed-up
mouth
,
a
turned-up
nose
,
and
sugary
eyes
,
fairly
thrust
herself
forward
.
It
was
evident
that
the
duty
of
entertaining
visitors
was
her
responsibility
and
did
not
weigh
upon
her
in
the
least
.
Both
sisters
wore
white
dresses
with
Hght-blue
rib-
bons
that
fluttered
with
the
sHghtest
movement
.
Bhie
suited
Emerentsiya
,
but
did
not
suit
Po-
linka
.
.
.
indeed
,
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
anything
to
suit
her
,
though
she
could
not
have
been
called
ugly
.
The
visitors
were
seated
and
the
usual
ques-
tions
were
put
to
them
,
pronounced
with
that
mawkish
and
affected
expression
of
face
seen
in
the
most
well-bred
persons
during
the
first
moments
of
conversation
with
new
acquaint-
ances
;
the
guests
replied
in
the
same
manner
.
All
this
had
a
somewhat
oppressive
effect
.
Kali-
mon
Ivanitch
,
who
was
not
naturally
very
re-
sourceful
,
asked
Boris
Andreyitch
``
whether
he
had
been
living
long
in
our
parts
''
though
Boris
Andreyitch
had
only
just
replied
to
the
same
question
from
Pelageya
Ivanovna
.
The
lady
in
a
very
soft
voice
the
voice
always
used
before
visitors
on
the
day
of
their
first
visit
reproached
her
husband
for
his
absent-minded-
ness
.
Kalimon
Ivanitch
was
rather
confused
and
blew
his
nose
loudly
with
a
check
pocket-hand-
The
Two
friends
kerchief
.
This
sound
excited
one
of
the
sheep-
dogs
and
it
began
barking
;
but
Emerentsiya
was
on
the
spot
at
once
and
soothed
it
back
into
silence
.
The
same
young
lady
contrived
to
render
another
service
to
her
somewhat
help-
less
parents
:
she
enlivened
the
conversation
by
modestly
but
resolutely
sitting
down
beside
Boris
Andreyitch
and
,
with
the
most
honeyed
air
,
asking
him
questions
which
though
trivial
were
agreeable
and
calculated
to
elicit
amusing
answers
.
Things
were
soon
going
swimmingly
;
a
lively
general
conversation
sprang
up
in
which
all
but
Polinka
took
part
.
She
looked
obsti-
nately
at
the
floor
,
while
Emerentsiya
actually
laughed
,
gracefully
lifting
up
one
hand
and
at
the
same
time
her
manner
seemed
to
be
saying
:
''
Look
,
look
,
how
well-bred
and
amiable
I
am
and
what
charming
playfulness
and
friendli-
ness
I
have
with
everyone
!
''
She
seemed
even
to
be
lisping
out
of
good
nature
.
She
laughed
with
lingering
dulcet
notes
,
though
Boris
An-
dreyitch
did
not
at
first
say
anything
particularly
funny..
She
laughed
still
more
when
Boris
Andreyitch
,
encouraged
by
the
success
of
his
words
,
began
being
really
witty
and
mali-
cious
.
.
.
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
laughed
too
.
Vya-
zovnin
observed
among
other
things
that
he
was
passionately
fond
of
music
.
``
And
I'm
most
awfully
fond
of
music
too
!
''
exclaimed
Emerentsiya
.
``
You
're
not
only
fond
of
it
you
're
a
first-
rate
musician
yourself
,
''
observed
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
.
``
Really
?
''
asked
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
Both
Emerentsiya
Kalimonovna
and
Pela-
geya
Kalimonovna
sing
and
play
the
piano
very
well
,
especially
Emerentsiya
Kalimonovna
.
''
On
hearing
her
name
Polinka
flushed
crim-
son
and
almost
started
up
from
her
seat
while
Emerentsiya
modestly
cast
down
her
eyes
.
``
Oh
,
Mesdemoiselles
,
''
said
Boris
Andreyitch
,
''
surely
you
will
not
refuse
to
be
so
good
.
.
.
to
give
me
the
pleasure
.
.
.
''
``
Really
...
I
do
n't
know
.
.
.
''
And
cast-
ing
a
sly
glance
at
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
she
added
reproachfully
:
``
Oh
,
what
a
man
you
are
!
''
But
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
like
a
practical
person
at
once
appealed
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
.
``
Pelageya
Ivanovna/
'
he
said
,
``
please
tell
your
daughters
to
play
or
sing
us
something
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
they
are
in
voice
to-
day
,
but
they
can
try
.
''
``
Yes
,
try
,
try
!
''
their
father
urged
.
``
Oh
,
Maman
,
but
how
can
we
?
.
.
.
''
``
Emerance
,
quand
je
vous
dis
.
.
.
''
Pela-
geya
Ivanovna
pronounced
in
a
low
voice
but
very
gravely
.
She
had
the
habit
,
common
to
many
mothers
,
of
giving
orders
or
addressing
reproofs
to
her
children
before
other
persons
in
French
,
even
though
those
persons
understood
that
language^
and
this
practice
was
the
more
strange
in
her
case
as
she
knew
very
little
French
and
pro-
nounced
it
badly
.
Emerentsiya
got
up
.
``
What
are
we
going
to
sing
,
Maman
f
''
she
asked
submissively
.
``
Your
duet
;
it
's
very
charming
.
My
daugh-
ters
,
''
Pelageya
Ivanovna
went
on
,
addressing
Boris
Andreyitch
,
``
have
different
voices
;
Emer-
entsiya
a
treble
.
.
.
''
``
Soprano
,
you
mean
?
''
``
Yes
.
.
.
.
Yes
.
.
.
.
Somprano
,
and
Polinka
contro-alto
.
''
Ah
!
Contralto
!
That
's
very
nice
.
''
``
I
ca
n't
sing
to-day/
'
Polinka
brought
out
with
an
effort
.
``
I
am
hoarse
.
''
Her
voice
cer-
tainly
sounded
more
like
a
bass
than
a
con-
tralto
.
``
Ah
,
well
,
if
so
,
Emerance
,
you
sing
us
your
piece
,
the
Italian
one
,
our
favourite
,
and
Po-
linka
will
accompany
you
.
''
``
The
piece
where
you
go
pattering
like
peas
,
''
her
father
chimed
in
.
``
The
bravura
,
''
explained
the
mother
.
The
two
young
ladies
went
to
the
piano
.
Polinka
raised
the
lid
.
put
a
book
of
manuscript
music
on
the
music
rest
and
sat
down
,
while
Emerentsiya
stood
by
her
,
throwing
herself
not
too
obviously
into
charming
attitudes
under
the
fixed
gaze
of
Boris
Andreyitch
and
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
,
and
at
times
putting
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
.
At
last
she
began
to
sing
,
as
for
the
most
part
young
ladies
do
sing
,
shrilly
and
going
off
at
moments
into
howls
.
She
did
not
articulate
the
words
distinctly
,
but
from
certain
nasal
sounds
it
could
be
surmised
that
she
was
singing
in
Italian
.
Towards
the
end
she
really
did
break
into
a
''
patter
like
peas
''
to
the
huge
delight
of
Kali-
mon
Ivanitch
he
raised
himself
slightly
in
his
easy-chair
and
exclaimed
:
''
Give
it
him
!
''
But
the
last
trill
she
let
off
earlier
than
she
should
,
so
that
her
sister
had
to
play
a
few
bars
by
herself
.
This
did
not
,
however
,
prevent
Boris
Andreyitch
from
expressing
his
pleasure
and
paying
Emerentsiya
compliments
,
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
after
repeating
twice
:
``
Very
good
,
very
good
,
''
added
:
``
Could
n't
you
give
us
something
Russian
now
;
the
'Nightingale
,
'
for
instance
,
or
the
'Little
Sarafan
,
'
or
some
gipsy
song
?
These
foreign
pieces
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
are
not
written
for
people
like
us
,
''
''
I
agree
with
you
,
''
said
Kalimon
Ivanitch.
''
Chant
e
:
;
le
Sarafan/
'
the
mother
observed
in
an
undertone
and
with
the
same
severity
as
before
.
``
No
,
not
the
'Sarafan
,
'
``
interposed
Kalimon
Ivanitch
,
``
but
'We
Two
Gipsy
Girls
'
or
'Take
Off
Your
Cap
and
Make
a
Low
Bow
'
;
do
you
know
it
?
''
``
Papa
!
You
are
always
like
that
!
''
Emer-
entsiya
protested
,
and
she
sang
``
Take
Off
Your
Cap
,
''
and
sang
it
fairly
well
.
Kalimon
Ivanitch
joined
in
humming
and
beating
time
with
his
foot
,
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
quite
delighted
.
``
Come
,
that
's
a
different
thing
!
That
's
in
our
style
,
''
he
declared
.
``
You
have
delighted
me
,
Emerentsiya
Kalimonovna
.
.
.
.
Now
I
see
that
you
have
the
right
to
call
yourself
a
devotee
of
music
and
a
mistress
of
your
art
.
''
``
Oh
,
how
indiscreet
you
are
!
''
retorted
Emer-
entsiya
,
and
would
have
gone
back
to
her
seat
.
``
A
present
le
'Sarafan
'
``
said
the
mother
.
Emerentsiya
sang
the
``
Sarafan
,
''
not
so
suc-
cessfully
as
``
Take
Off
Your
Cap
,
''
but
still
suc-
cessfully
.
``
Now
you
ought
to
play
us
your
Sonata
duet
,
''
observed
Pelageya
Ivanovna
,
``
though
perhaps
that
will
be
better
another
time
or
I'm
afraid
we
shall
weary
Monsieur
Vyazovnin
.
''
``
No
.
.
.
indeed
.
.
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
,
but
Polinka
closed
the
piano
at
once
and
Emer-
entsiya
declared
that
she
was
tired
.
Boris
Andreyitch
thought
it
necessary
to
repeat
his
compliment
.
``
Oh
,
Monsieur
Vyazovnin
,
''
she
answered
,
''
I
expect
you
have
heard
very
different
singers
''
;
I
can
imagine
what
my
singing
must
seem
like
after
them
.
.
.
though
indeed
when
Bome-
rius
was
here
,
he
did
say
to
me
.
.
.
.
You've
heard
of
Bomerius
,
I
expect
?
''
``
No
;
what
Bomerius
?
''
``
Good
gracious
!
The
celebrated
violinist
;
he
studied
in
the
Paris
Conservatoire
,
a
wonderful
musician
.
.
.
.
He
said
to
me
:
'With
your
voice
,
Mademoiselle
,
if
you
could
study
under
a
good
teacher
it
would
be
simply
marvellous
.
'
He
kissed
all
his
fingers
to
me
,
but
how
is
one
to
study
here
?
''
And
Emerentsiya
heaved
a
sigh
.
``
No
,
indeed
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
assented
po-
litely
,
``
but
with
your
talent
.
.
.
.
''
He
was
at
a
loss
for
words
and
looked
away
still
more
politely
.
``
Emerance
,
demandez
pourquoi
que
le
diner
,
''
said
Pelageya
Ivanovna
.
''Qui
,
Maman
,
''
replied
Emerentsiya
and
she
went
out
with
a
sprightly
little
skip
at
the
door
.
She
would
not
have
made
the
skip
if
there
had
not
been
visitors
.
Boris
Andreyitch
turned
to
Polinka
.
``
If
this
is
the
Larin
family
,
''
he
thought
,
''
perhaps
this
one
is
Tatyana
.
''
And
he
went
up
to
Polinka
,
who
watched
his
approach
not
without
terror
.
``
You
played
your
sister
's
accompaniment
charmingly
,
''
he
began
,
``
charmingly
!
''
Polinka
made
no
answer
;
she
merely
turned
crimson
to
her
ears
.
``
I
'm
very
sorry
I
've
not
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
your
duet
;
from
what
opera
is
it
?
''
Polinka
's
eyes
wandered
uneasily
.
Vyazovnin
waited
for
her
answer
;
no
answer
came
.
``
What
sort
of
music
do
you
like
best
?
''
he
asked
after
a
brief
interval
,
``
Italian
or
Ger-
man
?
''
Polinka
looked
down
.
``
Pelagic
,
repondez
done
,
''
Pelageya
Ivanovna
brought
out
in
an
agitated
whisper
.
``
Any
sort
,
''
Polinka
articulated
hurriedly
.
``
Any
sort
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
persisted
.
``
That
's
hard
to
believe
.
Beethoven
,
for
in-
stance
,
is
a
genius
of
the
first
rank
and
yet
he
is
not
appreciated
by
everyone
.
''
``
No
,
''
answered
Polinka
.
``
Art
is
infinitely
varied
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
continued
mercilessly
.
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Polinka
.
The
conversation
between
them
did
not
last
long
.
``
No
,
''
thought
Boris
Andreyitch
as
he
moved
away
from
her
,
``
she
is
not
a
Tatyana
;
she
is
simply
a
tremor
personified
.
.
.
.
''
And
when
poor
Polinka
was
going
to
bed
that
evening
she
complained
with
tears
to
her
maid
that
the
visitor
to-day
had
pestered
her
with
music
and
that
she
had
not
known
what
to
answer
,
and
that
she
was
always
wretched
when
visitors
came
;
it
only
meant
that
Mamma
scolded
afterwards
,
that
was
all
the
pleasure
she
got
out
of
it
.
At
dinner
Boris
Andreyitch
sat
between
Kali-
mon
Ivanitch
and
Emerentsiya
.
The
dinner
was
Russian
,
not
elaborate
but
ample
,
and
far
more
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
taste
than
the
wid-
ow
's
recherche
dishes
.
Polinka
was
sitting
be-
side
him
,
and
,
overcoming
her
shyness
at
last
,
she
did
anyway
answer
his
questions
.
Emerentsiya
,
on
the
other
hand
,
entertained
her
neighbour
so
zealously
that
at
last
he
could
hardly
endure
it
.
She
had
the
habit
of
turn-
ing
her
head
do
the
right
while
she
lifted
a
morsel
to
her
mouth
with
the
left
hand
,
as
if
she
was
playing
with
it
;
and
Boris
Andreyitch
very
much
disliked
this
habit
.
He
disliked
,
too
,
the
way
in
which
she
incessantly
talked
about
herself
,
confiding
to
him
with
much
feeling
the
most
trivial
details
of
her
life
;
but
as
a
well-
bred
man
he
made
no
outward
sign
of
his
senti-
ments
,
so
that
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
who
was
watching
him
across
the
table
,
was
quite
unable
to
decide
what
sort
of
impression
Emerentsiya
was
making
upon
him
.
After
dinner
Kalimon
Ivanitch
suddenly
sank
into
meditation
,
or
,
to
speak
more
directly
,
a
slight
doze
;
he
was
accustomed
to
take
a
nap
after
dinner
and
though
,
noticing
that
his
guests
were
preparing
to
take
their
leave
,
he
articu-
lated
several
times
:
``
But
why
is
this
,
gentle-
men
,
what
for
?
How
about
a
game
of
cards
?
''
yet
in
his
heart
he
was
pleased
when
he
saw
that
they
had
their
caps
in
their
hands
.
Pela-
geya
Ivanovna
on
the
contrary
grew
alert
at
once
and
with
peculiar
insistence
tried
to
keep
her
visitors
.
Emerentsiya
zealously
seconded
her
,
and
did
everything
she
could
to
persuade
them
to
remain
;
even
Polinka
said
:
``
Mais
Messieurs
.
.
.
.
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
answered
neither
yes
nor
no
and
kept
looking
towards
his
companion
;
but
Boris
Andreyitch
courteously
but
firmly
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
returning
home
.
It
was
in
fact
just
the
opposite
of
their
leave-
taking
from
Sofya
Kirillovna
.
Promising
to
repeat
their
visit
very
shortly
,
the
visitors
at
last
withdrew
;
Emerentsiya's
cordial
glances
followed
them
to
the
dining-
room
,
while
Kalimon
Ivanitch
even
went
out
with
them
to
the
hall
,
and
after
watching
Boris
Andreyitch
's
adroit
servant
wrap
the
gentlemen
in
their
fur
coats
,
wind
their
scarves
round
them
,
and
draw
their
warm
top
boots
on
to
their
feet
,
went
back
to
liis
study
and
promptly
fell
asleep
,
while
Polinka
,
after
being
put
to
shame
by
her
mother
,
went
off
to
her
own
room
upstairs
and
the
two
mute
feminine
figures
,
one
in
a
cap
,
the
other
in
a
dark
kerchief
,
con-
gratulated
Emerentsiya
on
her
new
conquest
.
The
friends
drove
off
in
silence
.
Boris
An-
dreyitch
smiled
to
himself
,
screened
from
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
by
the
turned-up
collar
of
his
rac-
coon-lined
coat
,
and
waited
to
see
what
he
would
say
.
``
Not
the
thing
again
!
''
exclaimed
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
.
But
this
time
a
certain
indecision
was
notice-
able
in
his
voice
,
and
straining
to
get
a
look
at
Boris
Andreyitch
over
his
fur
collar
,
he
added
in
an
enquiring
voice
:
``
It
's
not
,
is
it
?
''
``
No
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
answered
with
a
laugh
.
``
I
thought
not
,
''
replied
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
and
after
a
brief
silence
he
added
:
''
Though
,
after
all
,
why
not
?
In
what
way
is
the
young
lady
deficient
?
''
``
She
's
not
deficient
in
anything
;
on
the
con-
trary
she
has
too
much
of
everything
.
.
.
''
``
How
do
you
mean
too
much
?
''
``
What
I
say
!
''
``
Excuse
me
,
Boris
Andreyitch
,
I
do
n't
under-
stand
you
.
If
you
're
speaking
of
culture
,
is
that
amiss
?
And
as
regards
character
,
con-
duct
.
.
.
''
``
Oh
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
''
said
Boris
Andrey-
itch
,
``
I
'm
surprised
that
with
your
clear
way
of
looking
at
things
you
do
n't
see
through
that
mincing
Emerentsiya
!
That
affected
amiabil-
ity
,
that
continual
self-adoration
,
that
modest
conviction
of
her
own
virtues
,
that
indulgence
of
an
angel
looking
down
on
you
from
the
heights
of
heaven
,
but
there
's
no
need
of
words
!
If
it
came
to
that
,
in
case
of
necessity
I
'd
twenty
times
rather
marry
her
sister
.
She
does
know
how
to
hold
her
tongue
,
anyway
!
''
``
You
're
right
,
of
course
,
''
poor
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
answered
in
a
low
voice
.
Boris
Andrey-
itch
's
sudden
outburst
perplexed
him
.
``
No
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
and
he
said
it
for
the
first
time
since
his
acquaintance
with
Vyazov-
nin
,
``
this
fellow
's
not
on
my
level
.
.
.
.
He's
too
well
educated
.
.
.
.
''
Vyazovnin
for
his
part
was
thinking
as
he
gazed
at
the
moon
which
hung
low
over
the
white
rim
of
the
horizon
:
``
And
that
might
be
out
of
Onyegin
too
.
.
.
'
Round
,
ruddy-
cheeked
is
she
'
.
.
.
But
a
queer
sort
of
Lensky
I
've
got
and
I
'm
a
fine
Onyegin
.
''
``
Go
on
,
go
on
,
Laryushka
!
``
he
added
aloud
.
``
So
it
's
not
the
thing
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
asked
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
jestingly
,
as
with
the
The
two
friends
and
other
stories
assistance
of
his
groom
he
got
out
of
the
sledge
and
mounted
the
steps
of
his
house
:
``
Eh
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
?
''
But
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
made
him
no
answer
,
and
went
home
that
night
to
sleep
.
Emerentsiya
next
day
wrote
to
her
friend
(
she
carried
on
a
vast
and
active
correspond-
ence
)
:
''
A
new
visitor
came
to
see
us
yesterday
,
a
neighbour
called
Vyazovnin
.
He
is
a
very
charming
and
amiable
person
;
one
can
see
at
once
that
he
is
highly
cultured
and
shall
I
whisper
it
in
your
ear
?
I
fancy
I
made
rather
an
impression
upon
him
.
But
do
n't
be
uneasy
,
mon
amie
;
my
heart
was
not
touched
and
Valentin
has
nothing
to
fear
.
''
The
Valentin
referred
to
was
a
high-school
teacher
.
He
was
a
gay
dog
when
he
was
in
the
town
,
while
in
the
country
he
heaved
pla-
tonic
and
hopeless
sighs
for
Emerentsiya
.
The
friends
met
again
next
morning
as
usual
and
their
life
flowed
on
in
its
old
way
.
A
fortnight
passed
.
Boris
Andreyitch
was
in
daily
expectation
of
a
fresh
summons
but
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
seemed
to
have
completely
relinquished
his
design
.
Boris
Andreyitch
began
talking
of
the
widow
and
of
the
Tihoduevs
,
and
hinting
that
one
ought
to
give
everything
three
trials
;
but
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
gave
no
sign
of
understanding
his
hints
.
At
last
Boris
Andreyitch
could
not
re-
frain
from
beginning
.
``
How
's
this
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
?
''
he
said
.
``
It
seems
it
's
my
turn
now
to
remind
you
of
your
promises
.
''
``
What
promises
?
''
``
Do
n't
you
remember
you
meant
to
marry
me
;
I
am
waiting
.
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
turned
round
on
his
chair
.
``
But
you
see
,
you
're
so
particular
!
There's
no
satisfying
you
!
God
knows
what
you
want
.
It
seems
we
've
no
young
ladies
here
to
your
taste
.
''
``
That
's
too
bad
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
You
ought
not
to
despair
so
soon
.
To
fail
twice
is
not
much
to
complain
of
.
Besides
,
I
did
like
the
widow
.
If
you
abandon
me
,
I
'll
go
off
to
her
.
''
``
Well
,
go
then
,
and
God
bless
you
.
''
S
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
I
assure
you
,
I
do
want
to
get
married
,
in
earnest
;
take
me
somewhere
else
.
''
``
But
really
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
whole
district
.
''
``
That
's
impossible
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
Do
you
mean
to
say
there
's
not
one
pretty
girl
here
in
the
whole
neighbourhood
?
''
``
Of
course
there
are
plenty
,
but
not
a
match
for
you
.
''
``
But
do
name
someone
,
anyway
.
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
held
the
amber
of
his
pipe
in
his
teeth
.
``
Well
,
there
's
Verotchka
Barsukov
,
of
course
,
''
he
brought
out
at
last
;
``
what
could
be
better
?
Only
not
for
you
.
''
``
Why
not
?
''
``
Too
simple
.
''
``
All
the
better
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
All
the
better
.
''
``
And
her
father
is
such
a
queer
fish
.
''
``
That
does
n't
matter
either
.
.
.
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
my
dear
fellow
,
do
introduce
me
to
this
.
,
.
what
did
you
call
the
young
lady
?
''
``
Barsukov
.
''
``
To
this
Barsukov
girl
,
.
.
please
.
''
And
Boris
Andreyitch
gave
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
no
rest
until
the
latter
promised
to
take
him
to
the
Barsukovs
.
Two
days
later
they
drove
off
to
see
them
.
The
Barstikov
family
consisted
of
two
per-
sons
,
the
father
,
aged
fifty
,
and
the
daughter
,
aged
nineteen
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
had
correctly
described
the
father
as
a
queer
fish
;
he
really
was
a
singular
person
if
ever
there
was
one
.
After
brilliantly
completing
a
course
of
study
in
a
Government
institution
,
he
entered
the
Marine
service
,
and
quickly
attracted
the
atten-
tion
of
his
superior
officers
.
But
he
suddenly
retired
from
the
Service
,
married
,
settled
in
the
country
,
and
by
degrees
had
grown
lazy
and
let
himself
go
to
such
a
point
that
he
not
merely
gave
up
going
out
anywhere
,
but
did
not
even
leave
his
room
.
In
a
short
,
full
,
hare
skin
coat
and
slippers
without
any
back
to
them
,
with
his
hands
thrust
in
the
pockets
of
his
loose
Turkish
trousers
,
he
would
walk
to
and
fro
for
days
together
,
hum-
ming
or
whistling
,
and
whatever
was
said
to
him
he
would
answer
with
a
smile
:
``
Braoo
,
Braoo
,
''
by
which
he
meant
,
``
Bravo
,
Bravo
.
''
``
Do
you
know
,
Stepan
Petrovitch
?
''
a
neigh-
bour
would
say
,
to
him
,
for
instance
,
and
neighbours
went
to
see
him
readily
,
for
no
man
could
have
been
more
hospitable
and
genial
:
''
Do
you
know
they
say
the
price
of
rye
has
gone
up
to
thirteen
paper
roubles
at
Byelovo
?
''
``
Braoo
,
Braoo
,
''
Barsukov
would
answer
calmly
,
though
he
had
just
sold
his
rye
for
seven
and
a
half
.
``
And
have
you
heard
that
your
neighbour
Pavel
Fomitch
has
lost
twenty
thousand
at
cards
?
''
``
Braoo
,
Braoo
,
''
Barsukov
would
answer
just
as
calmly
.
``
There
's
the
cattle-plague
at
Salykovo
,
''
an-
other
neighbour
sitting
with
them
would
ob-
serve
.
``
Braoo
,
Braoo
!
''
``
The
Lapin
young
lady
has
run
off
with
the
bailiff
.
''
``
Braoo
,
Braoo
,
Braoo
!
''
And
so
on
endlessly
.
If
he
were
informed
that
his
horse
had
gone
lame
,
that
a
Jew
had
arrived
with
goods
,
that
the
clock
had
fallen
off
the
wall
,
that
the
boy
had
mislaid
his
boots
somewhere
,
the
only
comment
heard
from
him
was
``
Braoo
,
Braoo
,
''
and
yet
there
was
no
great
disorder
to
be
noticed
in
his
house
:
his
peasants
were
prosperous
and
he
made
no
debts
.
Barsukov
's
appearance
was
preposses-
sing
:
his
round
face
with
large
brown
eyes
,
a
delicate
,
regular
nose
and
red
lips
,
was
re-
markable
from
its
almost
youthful
freshness
.
This
freshness
was
the
more
striking
from
the
snowy
whiteness
of
his
hair
;
a
faint
smile
was
almost
continually
playing
on
his
lips
,
and
not
so
much
on
his
lips
as
in
the
dimples
in
his
cheeks
;
he
never
laughed
,
but
sometimes
,
very
rarely
,
giggled
hysterically
,
and
on
every
such
occasion
felt
unwell
afterwards
.
Apart
from
his
habitual
exclamation
he
said
very
little
and
only
what
was
quite
essential
,
with
the
utmost
possible
brevity
.
His
daughter
Verotchka
was
very
much
like
him
in
face
,
in
her
way
of
smiling
and
in
the
expression
of
her
dark
eyes
,
which
seemed
still
darker
from
the
delicate
tint
of
her
flaxen
hair
.
She
was
rather
short
and
charmingly
propor-
TH
TWO
FRIEiSTDS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
tioned
.
There
was
nothing
specially
attractive
about
her
,
but
one
had
only
to
glance
at
her
or
hear
the
sound
of
her
voice
to
say
to
one-
self
:
``
That
's
a
good
kind
creature
.
''
The
father
and
daughter
were
fond
of
each
other
;
the
whole
management
of
the
house
was
in
her
hands
and
she
liked
looking
after
it
.
.
.
.
She
had
no
other
pursuits
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
had
correctly
described
her
as
simple
.
When
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
and
Boris
Andrey-
itch
called
upon
Barsukov
he
was
as
usual
walking
up
and
down
in
his
study
.
This
study
,
which
might
have
been
called
a
draw-
ing-room
and
a
dining-room
,
since
visitors
were
received
and
meals
were
served
in
it
,
formed
about
half
of
the
little
house
.
The
furniture
in
it
was
ugly
but
comfort-
able
;
along
the
whole
length
of
one
of
the
walls
stood
an
extrfemely
broad
and
soft
sofa
with
a
multitude
of
cushions
,
a
sofa
very
well
known
to
all
the
gentlemen
of
the
neighbour-
hood
.
To
tell
the
truth
one
could
lie
luxuriously
on
that
sofa
.
In
the
other
rooms
there
were
only
chairs
,
little
tables
of
one
sort
or
another
,
and
cupboards
;
all
these
rooms
led
into
one
another
and
no
one
lived
in
them
.
Verotchka's
little
bedroom
looked
into
the
garden
and
ex-
cept
for
her
neat
little
bed
and
washing
stand
with
a
little
looking-glass
over
it
and
one
arm-
chair
there
was
no
furniture
in
it
either
.
On
the
other
hand
everywhere
,
in
all
the
corners
,
there
were
bottles
of
liqueurs
and
jars
of
jam
prepared
by
Verotchka
's
own
hand
.
On
going
into
the
hall
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
have
sent
in
his
name
and
Boris
An-
dreyitch
's
,
but
a
boy
in
a
long-skirted
coat
merely
glanced
at
him
and
began
taking
off
his
fur
coat
with
the
words
:
``
Please
walk
in
,
Sir
.
''
The
friends
went
into
Stepan
Petrovitch's
study
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
introduced
Boris
Andreyitch
.
Stepan
Petrovitch
pressed
his
hand
,
articu-
lated
:
``
Delighted
.
.
.
very
.
.
.
you
're
cold
.
.
.
vodka
?
''
and
with
a
motion
of
his
head
indicating
the
edibles
that
stood
on
a
little
table
,
he
fell
to
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
again
.
Boris
Andreyitch
drank
off
a
little
glass
of
i
vodka
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
did
the
same
and
they
both
sat
down
on
the
broad
sofa
with
a
multitude
of
cushions
.
Boris
Andreyitch
felt
at
once
as
though
he
had
been
sitting
on
that
sofa
for
ages
and
had
known
the
master
of
the
house
for
long
,
long
years
.
All
Barsukov's
visitors
were
familiar
with
that
feeling
.
He
was
not
alone
that
day
;
and
indeed
he
could
not
often
be
found
alone
.
There
was
sitting
with
him
a
pettifogging
clerk
,
a
thread-
bare
hack
with
a
wrinkled
face
like
an
old
woman
's
,
a
hawk
nose
and
restless
eyes
,
who
had
lately
had
a
snug
little
job
in
the
Govern-
ment
service
,
but
was
at
the
moment
awaiting
his
trial
for
some
malpractice
.
Holding
on
to
his
cravat
with
one
hand
and
the
lapel
of
his
coat
with
the
other
,
this
gentleman
was
keep-
ing
watch
on
Stepan
Petrovitch
and
,
waiting
till
the
guests
were
seated
,
he
brought
out
with
a
deep
sigh
:
''
Oh
,
Stepan
Petrovitch
,
Stepan
Petrovitch
!
It
's
easy
to
condemn
a
man
;
but
you
know
the
saying
:
'The
honest
man
's
a
sinner
,
the
rogue's
a
sinner
,
they
all
live
by
sin
and
so
do
we
.
'
``
''
Braoo
,
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
was
beginning
,
but
he
checked
himself
and
commented
:
''
A
nasty
saying
.
''
``
Who
denies
it
?
Of
course
it
's
nasty
,
''
re-
pHed
the
threadbare
gentleman
;
``
but
what
would
you
have
one
do
!
Poverty
is
not
one's
brother
,
you
know
;
it
eats
the
honesty
out
of
you
.
Here
I
'm
ready
to
appeal
to
these
noble
gentlemen
if
only
they
'll
be
so
good
as
to
listen
to
the
circumstances
of
my
case
.
.
.
.
''
``
May
I
smoke
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
asked
his
host
.
The
latter
nodded
.
``
Of
course
,
''
the
threadbare
gentleman
con-
tinued
,
``
I
,
too
,
perhaps
have
more
than
once
been
vexed
both
with
myself
and
the
world
generally
,
have
felt
,
so
to
say
,
the
generous
indignation
.
.
.
''
``
Invented
by
scoundrels
,
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
interrupted
.
The
gentleman
started
.
``
That
is
.
.
.
.
How
's
that
,
Stepan
Petrov-
itch
?
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
generous
in-
dignation
is
invented
by
scoundrels
?
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
gave
a
nod
again
.
The
gentleman
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
then
suddenly
broke
into
a
cracked
laugh
,
display-
ing
as
he
did
so
that
he
had
not
a
tooth
left
in
his
head
,
yet
he
spoke
fairly
clearly
.
``
He
,
he
,
Stepan
Petrovitch
,
you
always
talk
like
that
.
Our
attorney
may
well
say
of
you
that
you're
a
regular
humourist
.
''
``
Braoo
,
Braoo
!
''
replied
Barsukov
.
At
that
instant
the
door
opened
and
Ve-
rotchka
walked
in
.
Moving
with
a
firm
and
light
tread
,
she
brought
in
two
cups
of
coffee
and
a
jug
of
cream
on
a
round
green
tray
.
Her
dark-grey
dress
hung
gracefully
,
about
her
slender
form
.
Boris
Andreyitch
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
both
got
up
from
the
sofa
;
she
made
them
a
curtsey
in
response
,
without
put-
ting
down
the
tray
,
then
going
up
to
the
table
,
laid
her
burden
on
it
with
the
words
:
``
Here
is
your
coffee
.
''
``
Braoo
,
''
said
her
father
.
``
Two
more
cups
,
''
he
added
,
indicating
the
visitors
.
``
Boris
An-
dreyitch
,
my
daughter
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
made
her
a
second
bow
.
``
Will
you
have
coffee
?
''
she
asked
,
looking
quietly
straight
into
his
eyes
.
``
It
's
an
hour
and
a
half
to
dinner
time
,
''
''With
the
greatest
pleasure
,
''
answered
Boris
Andreyitch
.
Verotchka
turned
to
Krupitsyn
,
``
And
you
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
?
''
``
I
'll
have
a
cup
too
.
''
``
In
a
minute
.
It
's
a
long
time
since
I
've
seen
you
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
''
Saying
this
,
Ver-
otchka
went
out
.
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
after
her
and
bend-
ing
down
to
his
friend
,
whispered
in
his
ear
:
''
But
she
's
very
sweet
.
.
,
and
what
easy
manners
!
...
''
''
That
's
habit
,
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
answered
.
``
Why
,
it
's
something
hke
a
restaurant
here
;
there
's
always
someone
coming
or
going
.
''
As
though
to
confirm
Pyotr
Vassilyitch's
words
another
visitor
walked
into
the
room
.
This
was
a
very
corpulent
,
to
use
the
old-fash-
ioned
word
that
has
been
preserved
in
our
part
of
the
country
,
full-bodied
gentleman
with
a
big
face
,
big
eyes
and
lips
end
thick
ruffled
hair
.
An
expression
of
permanent
dissatisfaction
,
a
sour
expression
,
could
be
detected
in
his
coun-
tenance
.
He
was
wearing
a
very
roomy
coat
and
his
whole
person
swayed
as
he
walked
.
He
sank
heavily
onto
the
sofa
and
only
then
said
``
Good-day
,
''
without
,
however
,
addressing
any
one
of
the
company
in
particular
.
``
Vodka
?
'*
Stepan
Petrovitch
asked
him
.
``
No
!
Vodka
indeed
!
''
answered
the
new
guest
.
``
I
do
n't
want
vodka
.
How
are
you
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
?
''
he
added
,
looking
round
.
``
Good-day
,
Mihey
Miheyitch
,
''
answered
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
;
``
where
's
God
brought
you
from
?
''
``
Where
from
?
From
town
,
of
course
.
It's
only
you
lucky
fellows
who
've
no
need
to
go
to
town
,
but
I
,
thanks
to
the
trustees
and
to
these
gentry
,
''
he
added
,
jerking
his
finger
in
the
direction
of
the
gentleman
who
was
await-
ing
his
trial
,
``
I
've
knocked
up
all
my
horses
trailing
off
to
the
town
confound
it
!
''
``
Our
humble
respects
to
Mihey
Miheyitch
,
''
said
the
gentleman
who
had
been
so
uncere-
moniously
included
in
the
term
``
gentry
.
''
Mihey
Miheyitch
looked
at
him
.
``
Tell
me
one
thing
,
please
,
''
he
began
,
fold-
ing
his
arms
,
``
when
are
you
going
to
be
hanged
?
''
The
other
was
offended
.
``
But
you
ought
to
be
!
Upon
my
soul
,
you
ought
!
The
Government
is
too
indulgent
to
fellows
like
you
.
Let
me
tell
you
that
!
Why
,
does
it
trouble
you
that
you
're
to
be
tried
?
Not
a
bit
of
it
.
There
's
only
one
thing
may
be
annoying
now
,
there
's
no
hahen
sie'gewesen
now
!
''
And
Mihey
Miheyitch
made
a
motion
with
his
hand
as
though
he
had
caught
something
in
the
air
and
thrust
it
into
his
side
pocket
.
``
They
've
put
a
stop
to
that
!
Ah
,
you
riff-
raff
!
''
``
You
're
always
pleased
to
be
joking
,
''
re-
plied
the
retired
Government
clerk
,
``
and
you
will
not
take
into
consideration
that
he
who
gives
is
free
to
give
and
he
who
takes
to
take
.
Besides
I
have
not
acted
in
this
affair
on
my
own
initiative
.
Another
person
has
taken
the
principal
part
,
as
I
have
explained
.
.
.
.
''
``
Of
course
,
''
Mihey
Miheyitch
observed
ironically
,
``
the
fox
hid
under
the
harrow
from
the
rain
not
every
drop
would
fall
on
her
any-
way
.
But
you
must
own
our
police
captain
gave
you
a
good
wigging
?
Eh
?
It
was
a
sound
one
?
''
The
threadbare
gentleman
winced
.
``
He
's
a
man
quick
to
come
down
on
you
,
''
he
said
at
last
with
hesitation
.
``
I
should
think
so
!
''
``
With
all
that
,
though
,
of
him
one
could
.
.
.
''
``
He
's
a
priceless
man
,
a
real
treasure
,
''
Mihey
Miheyitch
interrupted
him
,
addressing
Stepan
Petrovitch
,
``
for
dealing
with
these
fine
fellows
and
for
drunkards
,
too
,
he
's
a
giant
.
''
``
Braoo
,
Braoo
,
''
commented
Stepan
Petrov-
itch
.
Verotchka
came
in
with
two
more
cups
of
coffee
on
a
tray
.
Mihey
Miheyitch
bowed
to
her
.
``
One
more
,
''
said
her
father
.
``
Why
do
you
take
all
this
trouble
yourself
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
said
as
he
took
the
cup
from
her
.
``
It
's
no
trouble
,
''
answered
Verotchka
,
``
and
I
do
n't
want
to
leave
it
to
the
man
;
it
seems
to
me
it
will
be
nicer
so
.
''
``
Of
course
,
from
your
hands
.
''
But
Verotchka
did
not
hear
his
politeness
;
she
went
out
and
came
back
at
once
with
coffee
for
Mihey
Miheyitch
.
``
Have
you
heard
,
''
Mihey
Miheyitch
began
,
when
he
had
emptied
his
cup
,
``
Mavra
Ilyi-
nitchna
is
lying
speechless
?
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
stopped
and
raised
his
head
.
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
Mihey
Miheyitch
went
on
,
''
paralysis
.
You
know
how
fond
she
was
of
good
eating
.
Well
,
the
day
before
yesterday
she
was
sitting
at
table
,
and
visitors
with
her
,
they
served
cold
kvass
soup
and
she
had
just
had
two
platesful
and
asked
for
a
third
all
at
once
she
looked
round
and
said
,
like
this
without
any
haste
,
you
know
:
'Take
away
the
soup
,
all
the
people
are
green
.
.
.
'
and
fell
flop
off
her
chair
.
They
flew
to
pick
her
up
and
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
.
.
.
she
explained
with
her
hands
,
but
her
tongue
would
n't
work
.
They
say
our
district
apothe-
cary
distinguished
himself
on
the
occasion
.
.
.
.
He
leapt
up
and
cried
:
*A
doctor
!
Send
for
a
doctor
!
'
He
quite
lost
his
head
.
And
after
all
,
what
is
his
practice
?
He
simply
lives
on
dead
bodies
.
''
``
Bra-oo
,
Bra-oo
,
''
Barsukov
articulated
pen-
sively
.
``
And
we
're
going
to
have
kvass
soup
to-
day
,
''
observed
Verotchka
,
sitting
down
in
the
corner
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
.
``
What
with
,
with
sturgeon
?
''
Mihey
Mi-
heyitch
asked
quickly
.
``
Yes
,
with
sturgeon
.
''
``
That
's
a
capital
thing
.
Here
they
say
kvass
soup
is
not
a
good
thing
in
winter
because
it's
a
cold
dish
.
That
's
nonsense
,
is
n't
it
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
?
''
``
Absolute
nonsense
,
''
answered
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
.
``
Why
,
is
n't
it
warm
here
in
this
room
?
''
``
Very
warm
.
''
``
Then
why
should
n't
one
eat
a
cold
dish
in
a
warm
room
?
I
do
n't
understand
.
''
``
And
I
do
n't
understand
either
.
''
The
conversation
continued
for
a
good
while
in
this
style
.
The
master
of
the
house
took
hardly
any
part
in
it
and
kept
on
walking
about
the
room
.
At
dinner
everyone
did
very
well
indeed
:
everything
was
good
though
simply
prepared
.
Verotchka
sat
at
the
head
,
helped
the
kvass
soup
,
sent
round
the
dishes
,
watched
how
her
guests
were
getting
on
,
and
tried
to
anticipate
their
wants
.
tHE
TWO
FllIENDS
Vyazovnin
sat
beside
her
and
watched
her
intently
.
Verotchka
like
her
father
could
not
speak
without
smiling
and
that
was
very
becom-
ing
to
her
.
Vyazovnin
addressed
her
from
time
to
time
with
a
question
,
not
for
the
sake
of
get-
ting
any
answer
from
her
but
merely
to
see
that
smile
.
After
dinner
Mihey
Miheyitch
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
and
the
gentleman
awaiting
his
trial
,
whose
name
was
Onufry
Ilyitch
,
sat
down
to
play
cards
.
Mihey
Miheyitch
did
not
again
speak
so
cruelly
of
him
,
though
he
con-
tinued
to
banter
him
;
possibly
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
Mihey
Miheyitch
had
had
a
drop
too
much
at
dinner
.
He
did
,
it
is
true
,
de-
clare
at
every
deal
that
all
the
aces
and
trumps
would
be
sure
to
be
Onufry
's
,
that
that
nettle-
seed
would
have
some
dodge
in
shuffling
,
that
his
hands
were
made
for
plunder
;
but
on
the
other
hand
after
they
had
w^on
a
game
together
Mihey
Miheyitch
quite
unexpectedly
praised
him
.
``
Well
,
say
what
you
like
,
you
're
a
bad
lot
of
course
,
but
'pon
my
soul
I
like
you
;
in
the
first
place
,
because
that
's
my
temperament
,
and
in
the
second
,
because
if
one
comes
to
think
The
two
friene
)
s
and
other
stories
of
it
there
are
plenty
worse
than
you
,
and
in-
deed
one
may
say
that
in
your
own
way
you're
a
decent
fellow
.
''
``
You
're
pleased
to
tell
the
truth
,
Mihey
Mi-
heyitch
,
''
replied
Onufry
Ilyitch
,
greatly
en-
couraged
by
these
words
.
``
The
holy
truth
;
only
persecution
of
course
.
*
.
.
.
''
``
Come
,
deal
,
deal
,
''
Mihey
Miheyitch
inter-
rupted
him
.
``
Persecution
,
indeed
!
What
per-
secution
?
Thank
God
you
're
not
sitting
in
the
Pugatchev
tower
in
chains
.
.
.
.
Deal
,
''
And
Onufry
Ilyitch
proceeded
to
deal
,
rap-
idly
winking
his
eyes
and
still
more
rapidly
moistening
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
with
his
long
thin
tongue
.
Meanwhile
Stepan
Petrovitch
was
walking
about
the
room
,
while
Boris
Andreyitch
kept
near
Verotchka
.
The
conversation
between
them
was
fragmentary
(
she
was
continually
going
out
)
and
so
in-
significant
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
repro-
duce
it
.
He
asked
her
who
lived
in
their
neigh-
bourhood
,
whether
she
often
went
out
visiting
,
whether
she
liked
keeping
house
.
To
the
ques-
tion
what
she
was
reading
,
she
answered
:
``
I
ought
to
read
but
I
've
no
time
.
''
And
yet
when
at
nightfall
a
boy
came
into
the
study
announc-
ing
that
their
horses
were
ready
,
he
was
sorry
to
be
going
away
,
sorry
not
to
go
on
seeing
those
kind
eyes
,
that
bright
smile
.
If
Stepan
Petrovitch
had
thought
fit
to
ask
him
he
would
certainly
have
stayed
the
night
;
but
Stepan
Petrovitch
did
not
do
so
,
not
because
he
was
not
pleased
with
his
new
visitor
but
because
his
rule
was
that
if
anyone
wanted
to
stay
the
night
he
gave
orders
at
once
himself
that
a
bed
should
be
prepared
for
him
.
Mihey
Miheyitch
and
Onufry
Ilyitch
did
so
;
they
even
slept
in
the
same
room
and
talked
long
after
midnight
.
Their
voices
were
dimly
audible
from
the
study
;
Onufry
Ilyitch
talked
most
and
seemed
to
be
telling
some
story
or
trying
to
prove
some-
thing
while
his
companion
merely
uttered
at
intervals
,
sometimes
in
a
dubious
,
sometimes
in
an
approving
tone
:
``
H
'm
.
''
Next
morning
they
drove
away
together
to
Mihey
Miheyitch's
estate
and
from
there
to
the
town
,
also
together
.
On
their
way
home
Boris
Andreyitch
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
were
for
a
long
time
silent
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
even
dropped
asleep
,
lulled
by
the
tinkling
of
the
bell
and
the
even
mo-
tion
of
the
sledge
.
``
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
said
at
last
.
``
Well
,
''
said
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
half
asleep
.
``
Why
is
it
you
do
n't
question
me
?
''
``
Question
you
about
what
?
''
``
Why
,
as
you
did
the
other
times
.
''
``
About
Verotchka
,
do
you
mean
?
''
``
Yes
!
''
``
So
that
's
what
you
're
after
!
Do
you
sup-
pose
I
meant
her
for
you
?
She
's
not
fit
for
you
.
''
``
You
're
wrong
in
thinking
that
;
I
like
her
far
better
than
all
your
Emerentsiyas
and
Sofya
Kirillovnas
.
''
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
``
What
I
tell
you
.
''
``
But
come
now
,
really
!
She
's
quite
a
sim-
ple
girl
.
She
may
be
a
good
housekeeper
,
it's
true
,
but
that
's
not
what
you
want
,
you
know
.
''
``
Why
not
?
Perhaps
that
's
just
what
I'm
looking
for
.
''
``
What
are
you
talking
about
,
Boris
An-
dreyitch
!
Upon
my
word
!
Why
,
she
doesn't
speak
French
at
all
!
''
``
What
of
it
?
Do
you
suppose
one
ca
n't
do
without
French
?
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
silent
for
a
space
.
``
I
had
n't
expected
this
at
all
.
.
.
from
you
,
that
is
.
...
I
believe
you
are
joking
.
''
``
No
,
I
'm
not
joking
.
''
``
God
knows
what
to
make
of
you
then
!
Why
,
I
thought
she
was
only
suited
for
a
fel-
low
like
me
.
However
,
she
really
is
a
first-
rate
girl
.
''
And
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
straightened
his
cap
,
thrust
his
head
into
the
pillow
and
fell
asleep
.
Boris
Andreyitch
went
on
thinking
about
Verotchka
.
He
was
haunted
by
her
smile
,
by
the
good-humoured
mildness
of
her
eyes
.
The
night
was
light
and
cold
,
the
snow
glistened
with
blue
gleams
Hke
diamonds
;
the
sky
was
spangled
with
stars
and
the
pleiades
twinkled
brightly
;
the
frost
crunched
and
crackled
un-
der
the
runners
;
the
twigs
on
the
trees
cov-
ered
with
icy
hoarfrost
faintly
tinkled
,
glitter-
ing
in
the
moonlight
as
though
they
were
made
of
glass
.
At
such
a
time
the
imagination
works
eagerly
.
Vyazovnin
experienced
this
.
He
pondered
all
sorts
of
things
before
the
sledge
stopped
at
last
at
his
steps
;
but
the
image
of
Verotchka
never
left
his
brain
and
secretly
accompanied
his
dreams
.
As
we
have
mentioned
already
,
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
was
surprised
at
the
impression
Ve-
rotchka
had
made
on
Boris
Andreyitch
,
but
he
was
still
more
surprised
two
days
later
when
his
friend
announced
that
he
meant
to
go
to
Barsukov
's
and
that
he
should
go
alone
if
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
were
not
disposed
to
accompany
him
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
replied
of
course
that
he
was
ready
and
delighted
,
and
the
friends
drove
off
>
to
Barsukov
's
again
,
and
again
spent
the
whole
day
there
.
As
on
the
first
occasion
,
they
found
several
visitors
whom
Verotchka
re-
galed
with
coffee
and
after
dinner
with
jam
;
but
Vyazovnin
had
more
conversation
with
her
than
on
the
first
visit
;
that
is
,
he
talked
more
to
her
.
He
told
her
about
his
past
life
,
about
Petersburg
,
about
his
travels
,
in
fact
about
anything
that
came
into
his
head
.
She
listened
to
him
with
quiet
interest
,
continually
smiling
and
looking
at
him
,
but
never
for
a
moment
forgot
her
duties
as
a
hostess
:
she
got
up
at
once
as
soon
as
she
noticed
that
her
visitors
needed
anything
and
brought
them
everything
herself
.
When
she
went
away
,
Vyazovnin
looked
placidly
about
him
and
did
not
leave
his
seat
;
she
came
back
,
sat
down
beside
him
and
took
up
her
work
,
and
he
entered
into
conver-
sation
with
her
again
.
Stepan
Petrovitch
would
go
up
to
them
,
listen
to
Vyazovnin
's
remarks
and
mutter
:
``
Bra-oo
,
Bra-oo
,
''
and
the
hours
simply
raced
by
.
This
time
the
two
friends
stayed
the
night
and
only
went
home
late
in
the
evening
of
the
following
day
.
.
.
.
At
parting
Vyazovnin
pressed
Verotchka's
hand
.
She
flushed
a
little
.
No
man
had
ever
pressed
her
hand
till
that
day
,
but
she
thought
that
that
was
what
they
did
in
Petersburg
.
The
two
friends
began
going
frequently
to
see
Stepan
Petrovitch
,
and
Boris
Andreyitch
in
particular
became
quite
at
home
in
his
house
.
At
times
he
had
a
great
craving
,
an
intense
longing
to
be
there
.
On
several
occasions
he
went
alone
.
He
liked
Verotchka
more
and
more
;
already
a
friendship
had
arisen
between
them
,
already
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
i*
she
was
tcM
>
cool
and
reasonable
a
friend
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
left
off
speaking
to
him
of
Verotchka
.
.
.
but
one
morning
,
after
loo'king
at
him
as
usual
for
some
time
without
speak-
ing
,
he
brought
out
significantly
:
''
Boris
Andreyitch
.
''
``
Well
?
''
replied
Boris
Andreyitch
,
and
he
coloured
a
little
,
though
he
could
not
say
why
.
``
There
is
something
I
wanted
to
say
to
you
,
Boris
Andreyitch
.
.
.
.
Mind
you
do
n't
.
.
.
er
.
.
.
it
would
be
bad
,
you
know
,
if
anything
,
for
instance
.
.
.
''
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
said
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
''
``
Why
,
about
Verotchka
.
.
.
.
''
``
About
Verotchka
?
''
And
Boris
Andreyitch
flushed
redder
.
``
Yes
.
Take
care
,
you
know
,
harm
is
soon
done
.
.
.
.
Wrong
,
that
is
.
.
.
excuse
my
openness
;
but
I
imagine
it
's
my
duty
as
a
friend
.
.
.
''
``
But
where
did
you
get
that
idea
,
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
interrupted
him
.
``
Verotchka
's
a
girl
of
the
strictest
principles
,
and
,
besides
,
there
's
nothing
between
us
but
the
most
ordinary
friendship
.
''
``
Oh
,
nonsense
,
Boris
Andreyitch
,
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
retorted
in
his
turn
.
``
How
can
a
cultivated
man
like
you
have
a
friendship
with
a
country
girl
who
has
never
been
outside
her
own
four
walls
?
''
``
You
're
at
that
again
!
''
Boris
Andreyitch
in-
terrupted
him
for
the
second
time
.
``
What
you
drag
culture
in
for
I
ca
n't
imagine
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
was
a
little
irritated
.
``
Well
,
listen
,
anyway
,
Boris
Andreyitch
,
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
said
impatiently
.
``
Since
it's
come
to
this
,
I
must
tell
you
,
you
have
a
per-
fect
right
to
be
reserved
with
me
,
but
as
for
deceiving
me
,
excuse
me
,
you
do
n't
.
I
have
eyes
too
.
Yesterday
''
they
had
been
together
at
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
the
evening
before
``
re-
vealed
a
great
deal
to
me
.
.
.
.
''
``
And
what
precisely
did
it
reveal
to
you
?
''
asked
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
It
revealed
to
me
that
you
love
her
and
are
even
jealous
over
her
.
''
Vyazovnin
looked
at
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
*'Well
,
and
does
she
love
me
?
''
``
That
I
ca
n't
say
for
certain
,
but
it
would
be
strange
if
she
did
n't
love
you
.
''
``
Because
I
'm
cultivated
,
you
mean
to
say
?
''
``
Both
because
of
that
and
because
you
are
well
off
.
And
your
appearance
is
attractive
,
too
,
but
the
property
is
the
chief
thing
.
''
Vyazovnin
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
.
``
How
could
you
see
that
I
was
jealous
?
''
he
suddenly
asked
,
turning
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
``
Why
,
you
were
not
like
yourself
yesterday
till
that
scamp
Karantyev
had
gone
.
''
Vyazovnin
made
no
answer
,
but
in
his
soul
he
felt
that
his
friend
had
spoken
the
truth
.
This
Karantyev
was
a
student
who
had
not
completed
his
studies
,
a
good-humoured
fel-
low
not
without
intelligence
and
feeling
,
but
utterly
nonsensical
and
hopelessly
ruined
.
His
powers
had
been
dissipated
by
his
passions
in
early
youth
;
he
had
been
left
too
young
without
guardianship
.
He
had
a
reckless
gipsy
face
and
was
altogether
like
a
gipsy
,
singing
and
dancing
like
one
.
He
fell
in
love
with
every
woman
he
met
.
Verotchka
attracted
him
very
much
.
Boris
Andreyitch
had
made
his
ac-
quaintance
at
Barsukov
's
and
had
at
first
been
very
well
disposed
towards
him
;
but
on
one
occasion
,
observing
the
peculiar
expression
of
face
with
which
Verotchka
listened
to
his
sing-
ing
,
he
began
to
feel
differently
about
him
.
``
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
''
said
Boris
Andreyitch
,
going
up
to
his
friend
and
standing
facing
him
,
``
I
ought
to
own
...
I
believe
you're
right
.
I
have
felt
it
for
a
long
time
,
but
you
have
completely
opened
my
eyes
.
I
certainly
am
not
indifferent
to
Verotchka
;
but
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
what
of
it
?
She
and
I
both
of
us
want
nothing
dishonourable
;
besides
,
as
I've
told
you
already
,
I
see
no
special
signs
on
her
part
of
a
liking
for
me
.
''
``
Quite
so
,
''
replied
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
``
but
the
Evil
One
is
powerful
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
was
silent
for
a
while
.
``
What
am
I
to
do
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
?
''
``
What
are
you
to
do
?
Give
up
going
there
.
''
``
You
think
so
?
''
``
Of
course
.
.
.
.
You
're
not
going
to
marry
her
!
''
Vyazovnin
was
silent
for
a
space
again
.
``
And
why
should
n't
I
marry
her
?
''
he
ex-
claimed
at
last
.
i
''
I
've
told
you
why
already
,
Boris
An-
dreyitch
;
she
's
not
a
match
for
you
.
''
``
I
do
n't
see
that
.
''
``
Well
,
if
you
do
n't
see
it
,
do
as
you
think
best
.
I
'm
not
your
guardian
,
''
And
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
began
filling
his
pipe
.
Boris
Andreyitch
sat
in
the
window
and
sank
into
thought
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
did
not
inter-
rupt
his
musings
but
with
great
composure
puffed
little
clouds
of
smoke
from
his
lips
.
At
last
Boris
Andreyitch
got
up
and
with
notice-
able
excitement
ordered
his
carriage
.
``
Where
to
?
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
asked
him
.
``
To
the
Barsukovs
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
an-
swered
abruptly
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
puffed
half
a
dozen
times
.
``
Am
I
to
go
with
you
or
what
?
``
-
''
No
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
I
should
like
to
go
alone
to-day
;
I
want
to
come
to
an
understand-
ing
with
Verotchka
herself
.
''
``
You
know
best
.
''
``
So
,
''
he
said
to
himself
as
he
saw
Boris
Andreyitch
out
,
``
this
is
how
a
joke
has
turned
to
earnest
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
.
.
.
and
all
through
idleness
,
''
he
added
as
he
set-
tled
himself
on
the
sofa
.
On
the
evening
of
the
same
day
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
,
who
had
gone
home
without
awaiting
his
friend
's
return
,
was
just
going
to
bed
when
all
at
once
Boris
Andreyitch
,
covered
with
pow-
dery
snow
,
dashed
into
his
room
and
threw
himself
on
his
neck
.
``
My
friend
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
congratulate
me
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
She
has
accepted
me
and
the
old
man
has
given
his
consent
too
.
.
.
.
It's
all
settled
!
''
``
How
's
that
?
.
.
.
What
do
you
mean
?
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
muttered
in
astonishment
.
``
I
'm
going
to
get
married
!
''
``
To
Verotchka
?
''
``
Yes
.
.
.
.
It
's
all
settled
and
arranged
.
''
``
It
ca
n't
be
!
''
``
What
a
man
you
are
;
I
tell
you
it
's
all
settled
.
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
hurriedly
slid
his
bare
feet
into
slippers
,
flung
on
his
dressing
gown
and
shouted
:
''
Makedoniya
,
tea
!
''
and
added
:
``
Well
,
since
it
's
all
settled
it
's
no
use
talking
about
it
;
God
give
you
concord
and
counsel
!
But
please
tell
me
how
it
all
happened
.
''
``
With
pleasure
,
if
you
like
,
''
answered
Vyazovnin
,
and
began
telling
him
.
This
was
how
it
really
had
happened
.
When
Boris
Andreyitch
had
arrived
at
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
,
the
latter
,
contrary
to
his
usual
habit
,
had
no
visitor
with
him
and
was
not
walking
up
and
down
the
room
but
was
sit-
ting
in
an
invalid
chair
;
he
was
not
very
well
.
When
this
was
the
case
he
gave
up
talking
altogether
;
and
so
he
merely
gave
Vyazovnin
a
friendly
nod
,
first
pointing
him
to
the
table
with
food
on
it
and
then
to
Verotchka
,
and
closed
his
eyes
.
This
was
all
Vyazovnin
wanted
;
he
sat
down
by
Verotchka
and
began
talking
to
her
in
a
low
voice
.
They
spoke
of
Stepan
Petrovitch's
heakh
.
``
I
'm
always
frightened
,
''
Verotchka
said
in
a
whisper
,
``
when
he
is
unwell
.
You
know
what
he
is
;
he
does
n't
complain
,
does
n't
ask
for
anything
,
you
ca
n't
get
a
word
out
of
him
.
He
'll
be
ill
and
say
nothing
.
''
'And
you
love
him
very
much
?
''
Vyazovnin
asked
her
.
``
Whom
?
Father
?
Yes
,
more
than
anyone
in
the
world
.
God
preserve
us
from
anything
happening
to
him
.
I
beheve
I
should
die
.
''
``
Then
it
would
be
impossible
for
you
to
part
from
him
?
''
``
Part
?
What
should
I
part
from
him
for
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
into
her
face
.
``
A
girl
ca
n't
live
all
her
life
in
her
father's
house
.
''
``
Ah
I
see
what
you
mean
.
Well
,
I
needn't
trouble
then
.
Who
would
have
me
?
''
``
I
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
was
almost
saying
,
but
he
restrained
himself
.
``
What
are
you
thinking
?
''
she
asked
,
looking
at
him
with
her
habitual
smile
.
``
I
think
.
.
.
''
he
replied
,
``
I
think
.
.
.
that
.
.
.
''
And
suddenly
changing
his
tune
,
he
asked
her
how
long
she
had
known
Karantyev
.
``
I
really
do
n't
remember
.
.
.
.
You
see
,
so
many
of
them
come
to
see
father
.
I
believe
he
came
to
see
us
for
the
first
time
last
year
.
''
``
Tell
me
do
you
like
him
?
''
``
No
,
''
answered
Verotchka
after
a
moment's
thought
.
``
Why
not
?
''
``
He
's
so
untidy
,
''
she
answered
simply
.
``
But
he
must
be
a
good
fellow
and
he
sings
so
splendidly
.
...
It
stirs
one
's
heart
when
he
sings
.
''
``
Ah
!
''
Vyazovnin
commented
,
and
after
a
brief
pause
he
added
,
``
Whom
do
you
like
then
?
''
``
I
like
a
great
many
people
,
I
like
you
.
''
``
You
and
I
are
friends
,
we
know
,
but
is
there
no
one
you
'
like
more
than
the
rest
?
''
``
How
inquisitive
you
are
!
''
``
And
you
are
very
cold
.
''
``
How
so
?
''
Verotchka
asked
naively
.
``
Listen
,
''
Vyazovnin
was
beginning
.
.
.
.
But
at
that
instant
Stepan
Petrovitch
turned
in
his
chair
.
``
Listen
,
''
he
went
on
,
hardly
audibly
,
while
the
blood
seemed
to
be
throbbing
in
his
throat
.
``
There
is
something
I
must
say
to
you
,
very
important
,
only
not
here
.
''
``
Where
then
?
''
``
Why
,
in
the
next
room
,
for
instance
.
''
``
What
is
it
?
A
secret
,
then
?
''
said
Ve-
rotchka
,
getting
up
.
``
Yes
,
a
secret
.
''
``
A
secret
,
''
repeated
Verotchka
wonderingly
and
she
went
into
the
next
room
,
Vyazovnin
followed
her
as
though
in
a
fever
.
``
Well
,
what
is
it
?
''
she
asked
him
with
curiosity
.
Boris
Andreyitch
meant
to
lead
up
to
the
subject
,
but
glancing
at
that
youthful
face
beaming
with
the
faint
smile
which
he
so
loved
,
at
those
clear
eyes
gazing
at
him
with
such
a
soft
look
,
he
lost
his
head
and
quite
to
his
own
surprise
asked
Verotchka
bluntly
,
without
any
preliminary
:
''
Vera
Stepanovna
,
will
you
be
my
wife
?
''
``
What
?
''
said
Verotchka
,
turning
hot
all
over
and
flushing
crimson
to
her
ears
.
``
Will
you
be
my
wife
?
''
Vyazovnin
repeated
mechanically
.
``
I
...
I
really
do
n't
know
,
I
did
n't
expect
.
.
.
it
's
so
.
.
.
''
whispered
Verotchka
,
stretch-
ing
out
her
hand
to
the
window-sill
to
steady
herself
,
and
all
at
once
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
into
her
bedroom
.
Boris
Andreyitch
remained
standing
where
he
was
for
a
little
while
,
then
in
great
con-
fusion
went
back
to
the
study
.
On
the
table
lay
a
number
of
the
Moscow
News
.
He
took
it
up
and
began
looking
at
the
printed
lines
,
not
only
without
understanding
what
was
in
them
but
even
without
any
idea
of
what
was
happening
to
him
generally
.
He
spent
a
quar-
ter
of
an
hour
in
this
condition
;
but
all
at
once
there
was
a
faint
rustle
behind
him
and
with-
out
looking
round
he
felt
that
Verotchka
had
come
in
.
A
few
more
moments
passed
;
he
stole
a
glance
at
her
from
behind
the
pages
of
the
Moscow
News
.
She
was
sitting
in
the
window
,
turned
away
from
him
,
and
she
looked
pale
.
At
last
he
plucked
up
courage
and
got
up
,
went
to
her
and
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
her
.
Stepan
Petrovitch
did
not
stir
,
sitting
in
his
low
chair
with
his
head
thrown
back
.
``
Forgive
me
,
Vera
Stepanovna
,
''
Vyaaovnin
began
with
some
effort
.
``
I
am
to
blame
,
I
ought
not
so
suddenly
.
.
.
and
besides
...
I
had
of
course
no
grounds
.
.
.
''
Verotchka
made
no
answer
.
``
But
since
it
has
happened
like
this
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
went
on
,
'1
should
like
to
know
what
answer
.
.
.
''
Verotchka
gently
bowed
her
head
,
her
cheeks
flushed
again
.
``
Vera
Stepanovna
,
one
word
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
,
really
.
.
.
''
she
began
,
``
Boris
Andreyitch
...
it
depends
on
father
.
...
''
''
Unwell
?
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
voice
asked
suddenly
.
4
Verotchka
started
and
quickly
raised
her
head
.
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
eyes
fastened
upon
her
expressed
uneasiness
.
She
went
up
to
him
at
once
.
``
You
are
asking
me
something
,
father
?
''
``
Feeling
unwell
?
''
he
repeated
.
``
Who
?
...
I
?
...
No
.
.
,
.
What
makes
you
think
so
?
''
He
looked
at
her
intently
.
``
Really
quite
well
?
''
he
asked
once
more
.
``
Of
course
;
how
do
you
feel
?
''
``
Braoo
,
Bra-oo
,
''
he
said
softly
and
closed
his
eyes
again
.
Verotchka
turned
towards
the
door
,
Boris
Andreyitch
stopped
her
.
``
Tell
me
,
anyway
,
do
you
allow
me
to
speak
to
your
father
?
''
``
If
you
like
,
''
she
whispered
,
``
only
,
Boris
Andreyitch
,
I
think
I
am
not
a
match
for
you
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
would
have
taken
her
hand
;
but
she
evaded
him
and
went
away
.
``
Strange
!
''
he
thought
.
``
She
says
exactly
the
same
thing
as
Krupitsyn
.
''
Left
alone
with
Stepan
Petrovitch
,
Boris
An-
dreyitch
vowed
to
explain
things
more
sen-
sibly
to
him
and
as
far
as
possible
to
prepare
him
for
the
unexpected
proposal
;
but
his
task
turned
out
in
reality
even
more
difficult
than
speaking
to
Verotchka
.
Stepan
Petrovitch
was
a
little
feverish
and
in
a
state
between
brooding
and
dozing
.
He
made
reluctant
and
tardy
answers
to
the
vari-
ous
questions
and
observations
by
means
of
which
Boris
Andreyitch
hoped
gradually
to
lead
up
to
the
real
subject
of
the
conversa-
tion
.
...
In
short
,
Boris
Andreyitch
,
seeing
that
his
hints
were
being
thrown
away
,
was
compelled
to
approach
the
subject
directly
.
Several
times
he
took
breath
as
though
pre-
paring
to
speak
,
stopped
short
and
did
not
utter
a
word
.
``
Stepan
Petrovitch
,
''
he
began
at
last
,
``
I
in-
tend
to
make
you
a
proposal
that
will
surprise
you
very
much
.
''
``
Bra-oo
,
Bra-oo
,
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
replied
calmly
.
``
A
proposal
which
you
do
not
expect
in
the
least
.
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
opened
his
eyes
.
``
Only
please
do
n't
be
angry
with
me
.
.
.
.
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
eyes
opened
more
widely
.
``
I
...
I
intend
to
ask
you
for
the
hand
of
your
daughter
,
Vera
Stepanovna
.
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
got
up
quickly
from
his
invalid
chair
.
``
What
?
''
he
asked
,
in
exactly
the
same
voice
and
with
the
same
expression
of
face
as
Verotchka
.
Boris
Andreyitch
was
compelled
to
repeat
his
proposal
.
Stepan
Petrovitch
fixed
His
eyes
on
Vyazov-
nin
and
looked
at
him
a
long
time
in
silence
so
that
at
last
he
felt
awkward
.
tHE
TWO
FRIENDS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
'-
``
Does
Vera
know
?
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
asked
.
``
I
have
spoken
to
Vera
Stepanovna
and
she
has
allowed
me
to
address
myself
to
you
.
''
``
Were
you
speaking
to
her
just
now
?
''
``
Yes
,
Just
now
.
''
``
Wait
a
minute
,
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
articu-
lated
,
and
he
went
out
.
Boris
Andreyitch
was
left
alone
in
the
queer
old
man
's
study
.
In
a
state
of
stupor
he
gazed
first
at
the
walls
and
then
at
the
floor
,
when
suddenly
there
was
a
sound
of
horse
's
hoofs
at
the
steps
,
the
front
door
banged
.
A
thick
voice
asked
:
``
At
home
?
''
Steps
were
heard
and
Mihey
Miheyitch
,
al-
ready
known
to
the
reader
,
walked
swaying
into
the
study
.
Boris
Andreyitch
was
ready
to
die
with
vexation
.
``
How
warm
it
is
in
here
!
''
exclaimed
Mihey
ISIiheyitch
,
dropping
onto
the
sofa
,
''
Ah
,
how
do
you
do
?
And
where
's
Stepan
Petrovitch
?
''
``
He
's
just
gone
out
;
he
'll
be
back
directly
.
'*
''
It
's
awfully
cold
to-day
,
''
observed
Mihey
Miheyitch
,
pouring
himself
out
a
glass
of
vodka
.
And
,
scarcely
giving
himself
time
to
swallow
it
,
he
added
briskly
:
''
I
've
come
from
the
town
again
,
you
know
.
''
``
From
the
town
?
''
repeated
Vyazovnin
,
con-
cealing
his
emotion
with
difficulty
.
``
From
the
town
,
''
repeated
Mihey
Miheyitch
,
''
and
all
thanks
to
that
brigand
Onufry
.
Only
fancy
,
he
told
me
no
end
of
tales
,
held
out
such
alluring
prospects
that
it
made
one
's
mouth
water
!
'I
have
found
an
investment
for
you
,
'
says
he
,
'like
nothing
else
in
the
world
.
You've
simply
to
rake
the
shekels
in
by
hundreds
,
and
the
whole
thing
ended
in
his
borrowing
twenty-five
roubles
from
me
and
my
dragging
myself
off
to
the
town
for
nothing
.
I
quite
knocked
up
my
horses
.
''
``
You
do
n't
say
so
,
''
muttered
Vyazovnin
.
``
I
tell
you
he
's
a
brigand
,
a
brigand
,
if
ever
there
was
one
.
He
might
as
well
be
a
high-
wayman
with
a
bludgeon
.
I
really
do
n't
know
what
the
police
are
about
.
If
he
goes
on
like
this
,
he
will
leave
me
without
a
half-penny
,
upon
my
soul
!
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
came
into
the
room
.
Mihey
Miheyitch
began
describing
his
adven-
tures
with
Onufry
.
``
And
why
is
it
somebody
does
n't
give
him
a.
good
hiding
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Does
n't
give
him
a
hiding
!
''
repeated
Stepan
Petrovitch
,
and
he
suddenly
went
off
into
a
peal
of
laughter
.
Mihey
Miheyitch
laughed
too
,
looking
at
him
and
even
repeat-
ing
``
Precisely
,
he
ought
to
have
a
good
hiding
.
''
But
when
Stepan
Petrovitch
fell
on
the
sofa
in
paroxysms
of
hysterical
laughter
,
Mihey
Miheyitch
turned
to
Boris
Andreyitch
and
turn-
ing
up
the
palms
of
his
hands
,
commented
:
''
There
,
he
is
always
like
that
:
bursts
out
laugh-
ing
,
the
Lord
only
knows
what
at
.
That
's
his
whimsy
!
''
Verotchka
came
in
looking
agitated
and
with
red
eyes
.
``
Papa
's
not
quite
well
to-day
,
''
she
observed
in
an
undertone
to
Mihey
Miheyitch
.
Mihey
Miheyitch
nodded
and
put
a
piece
of
cheese
into
his
mouth
.
At
last
Stepan
Petrov-
itch
left
off
laughing
,
got
up
,
heaved
a
sigh
and
began
walking
about
the
room
.
Boris
Andreyitch
avoided
his
eyes
and
sat
as
though
on
thorns
.
Mihey
]
\Iiheyitch
fell
to
abusing
Onufry
Ilyitch
again
.
They
had
dinner
;
at
dinner
,
too
,
Mihey
Mi-
heyitch
was
the
only
one
who
talked
;
it
was
almost
evening
when
Stepan
Petrovitch
took
Boris
Andreyitch
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
into
the
other
room
.
``
You
are
a
good
man
?
''
he
asked
,
looking
into
his
face
.
``
I
am
an
honest
man
,
Stepan
Petrovitch
,
''
replied
Boris
Andreyitch
,
``
that
I
can
answer
for
,
and
I
love
your
daughter
.
''
``
You
love
her
?
Really
?
''
``
I
love
her
and
will
try
to
deserve
her
love
.
''
``
You
wo
n't
get
tired
of
her
?
''
Stepan
Petrov-
itch
asked
again
.
``
Never
.
''
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
face
contracted
with
a
look
of
pain
.
``
Well
.
.
.
mind
.
.
.
love
her
...
I
con-
sent
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
would
have
embraced
him
but
he
said
:
``
Afterwards
.
.
.
that
's
all
right
,
''
and
turning
away
he
moved
to
the
wall
.
Boris
Andreyitch
could
see
that
he
was
crying
.
Stepan
Petrovitch
wiped
his
eyes
without
turning
round
,
then
went
back
to
the
study
,
passing
Boris
Andreyitch
,
and
,
without
looking
at
him
,
said
with
his
habitual
smile
:
''
Please
,
no
more
to-day
.
.
.
to-morrow
.
.
.
all
.
.
.
that
's
necessary
.
.
.
.
''
``
Certainly
,
certainly
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
hur-
riedly
assured
him
,
and
following
him
into
the
study
,
exchanged
a
glance
with
Verotchka
.
There
was
joy
in
his
soul
,
but
at
the
same
time
some
disquietude
.
He
could
not
remain
longer
at
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
in
the
society
of
Mihey
Miheyitch
;
he
felt
he
must
be
alone
besides
,
he
longed
to
tell
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
He
went
away
promising
to
come
back
next
day
.
As
he
said
good-bye
to
Verotchka
he
kissed
her
hand
.
She
looked
at
him
.
``
Till
to-morrow
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
``
Good-bye
,
''
she
answered
softly
.
``
Do
you
know
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
''
Boris
Andreyitch
said
when
he
had
finished
his
story
and
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
friend
's
bed-
room
:
``
What
I
think
is
that
a
young
man
often
does
n't
marry
because
he
thinks
it
dread-
ful
to
put
his
life
into
bondage
;
he
thinks
,
'Why
should
I
be
in
a
hurry
?
I
've
plenty
of
time
,
perhaps
I
may
find
something
better/
and
the
business
usually
ends
in
his
being
a
lonely
old
bachelor
or
marrying
the
first
woman
he
comes
across
.
It
's
all
due
to
pride
and
egoism
.
If
God
has
sent
you
a
sweet
,
good
girl
,
do
n't
lose
your
chance
;
be
happy
and
do
n't
be
too
par-
ticular
.
I
shall
not
find
a
wife
better
than
Verotchka
;
and
if
she
is
somewhat
deficient
in
regard
to
education
it
will
be
my
work
to
look
after
that
.
She
has
rather
a
phlegmatic
char-
acter
,
but
that
's
no
harm
,
quite
the
contrary
.
That
's
why
I
decided
so
quickly
.
And
if
I
have
made
a
mistake
``
he
added
,
and
stopped
short
;
after
thinking
a
little
,
he
went
on
:
''
there
's
no
great
harm
done
.
Nothing
would
have
come
of
my
life
anyway
.
''
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
listened
to
his
friend
in
silence
,
from
time
to
time
sipping
from
a
cracked
glass
the
very
nasty
tea
prepared
by
the
zealous
Makedonia
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
speak
?
''
Boris
Andreyitch
asked
him
at
last
,
coming
to
a
standstill
before
him
.
``
What
I
say
is
right
,
is
n't
it
?
You
agree
with
me
,
do
n't
you
?
''
``
The
proposal
has
been
made
,
''
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
rejoined
emphatically
.
``
The
father
has
given
his
blessing
,
the
daughter
has
not
refused
you
,
so
it
's
no
use
discussing
it
further
.
Per-
haps
it
really
is
for
the
best
.
Now
it
's
the
wed-
ding
we
must
think
about
,
not
discussing
its
wisdom
;
but
morning
brings
good
counsel
;
we
will
talk
it
over
properly
to-morrow
.
``
Hey
!
Boy
there
!
Take
Boris
Andreyitch
down
.
''
``
You
might
at
least
embrace
me
and
con-
gratulate
me
,
''
said
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
What
a
fellow
you
are
,
really
!
''
``
Embrace
you
I
certainly
will
,
with
pleas-
ure
.
''
And
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
embraced
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
God
give
you
all
earthly
happi-
ness
!
''
The
friends
parted
.
``
It
's
all
because
,
''
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
said
aloud
to
himself
,
after
lying
for
some
time
in
bed
and
tossing
from
side
to
side
,
``
it
's
all
be-
cause
he
has
not
served
in
the
army
!
He
has
grown
used
to
indulging
his
whims
and
knows
nothing
of
discipline
.
''
A
month
later
Vyazovnin
married
Ve-
rotchka
.
He
insisted
that
the
wedding
should
not
be
put
off
longer
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
his
best
man
.
During
that
month
Vyazovnin
went
often
to
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
;
but
no
change
was
perceptible
in
his
behaviour
to
Ve-
rotchka
and
her
behaviour
to
him
;
she
was
a
little
more
reserved
with
him
,
that
was
all
.
He
brought
her
``
Yurey
Miloslavsky
''
and
read
aloud
some
chapters
.
She
liked
Zagoskin's
novel
,
but
when
it
was
finished
she
did
not
ask
for
another
.
Karantyev
came
once
to
have
a
look
at
Verotchka
,
since
she
had
become
en-
gaged
to
another
man
,
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
came
drunk
;
he
kept
gazing
at
her
as
though
he
were
going
to
say
something
but
said
nothing
.
He
was
asked
to
sing
.
He
sang
some
discon-
solate
ditty
,
then
burst
into
a
gay
and
reckless
one
,
flung
down
the
guitar
on
the
sofa
,
said
good-bye
to
everyone
and
,
getting
into
his
sledge
,
flung
himself
face
downwards
on
the
hay
strewn
in
it
,
burst
into
sobs
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
dead
.
The
day
before
the
wedding
Verotchka
was
very
sad
and
Stepan
Petrovitch
was
low-spir-
ited
too
.
He
had
hoped
that
Boris
Andreyitch
would
consent
to
come
and
live
with
him
.
The
latter
,
however
,
had
not
hinted
at
this
,
but
on
the
contrary
had
suggested
that
Stepan
Petrov-
itch
might
stay
for
a
time
at
Vyazovno
.
The
old
man
had
refused
;
he
was
used
to
his
study
.
Verotchka
promised
to
visit
him
at
least
once
a
week
.
How
mournfully
her
father
answered
her
:
``
Bra-oo
,
Bra-oo
!
''
So
Boris
Andreyitch
began
his
life
as
a
mar-
ried
man
.
Verotchka
,
being
an
excellent
house-
keeper
,
put
his
whole
house
in
order
.
He
ad-
mired
her
noiseless
but
careful
activity
,
her
mild
always
serene
rule
,
called
her
``
his
little
Dutchwoman
''
and
was
continually
repeating
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
that
he
had
never
before
known
what
happiness
was
.
It
must
be
ob-
served
that
,
from
the
wedding
day
onwards
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
gave
up
visiting
him
so
often
and
staying
so
long
,
though
Boris
Andreyitch
received
him
as
warmly
as
ever
and
though
Verotchka
had
a
genuine
affection
for
him
.
``
Your
life
is
not
the
same
now
,
''
he
would
say
to
Vyazovnin
when
the
latter
reproached
him
affectionately
for
having
grown
colder
to
him
.
``
You
're
a
married
man
;
I
'm
a
bachelor
.
I
may
be
in
your
way
.
''
1
At
first
Vyazovnin
did
not
contradict
him
;
but
by
degrees
he
began
to
notice
that
he
was
dull
at
times
without
his
friend
.
His
wife
did
not
restrict
his
liberty
in
the
least
;
on
the
con-
trary
he
sometimes
forgot
about
her
altogether
and
for
whole
mornings
at
a
stretch
would
not
say
a
single
word
to
her
,
though
he
always
looked
into
her
face
with
pleasure
and
tender-
ness
,
though
every
time
she
passed
by
him
with
her
light
step
he
would
catch
her
hand
and
kiss
it
,
which
invariably
drew
a
smile
to
her
lips
the
smile
was
the
same
that
he
had
so
loved
;
but
is
a
smile
alone
enough
?
They
had
too
little
in
common
and
he
began
to
be
aware
of
it
.
``
There
's
no
denying
that
my
wife
has
very
few
resources
,
''
thought
Boris
Andreyitch
one
day
,
as
he
sat
with
folded
arms
on
the
sofa
.
The
words
Verotchka
had
said
to
him
on
the
lOI
day
of
his
proposal
:
``
I
am
not
a
match
for
you
,
''
echoed
in
his
heart
.
``
If
I
had
been
a
German
or
a
savant
,
''
he
pursued
his
reflections
,
``
or
if
I
had
had
some
constant
occupation
which
would
have
en-
grossed
the
greater
part
of
my
time
,
such
a
wife
would
have
been
a
godsend
,
but
as
it
is
!
Can
I
have
made
a
mistake
?
''
.
.
.
This
last
thought
was
more
acutely
painful
to
him
than
he
had
expected
.
When
that
same
morning
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
repeated
that
he
could
not
but
be
in
his
way
,
Boris
Andreyitch
could
not
restrain
himself
and
exclaimed
:
``
Upon
my
word
,
you
're
not
in
the
least
in
our
way
;
on
the
contrar
}
'
,
when
you
are
here
we
are
both
ever
so
much
more
lively
''
he
had
almost
said
more
at
ease
,
and
it
was
certainly
true
.
Boris
Andreyitch
chatted
eagerly
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
exactly
as
he
had
done
before
his
marriage
;
and
Verotchka
could
talk
to
him
too
,
while
for
her
husband
she
felt
a
great
respect
,
and
,
with
all
her
unmistakable
devotion
to
him
,
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
,
how
to
enter-
tain
him
.
Besides
,
she
saw
that
Pyotr
Vassilyitch's
presence
enlivened
him
.
It
ended
in
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
becoming
quite
an
indispensable
person
in
the
house
.
He
loved
Verotchka
as
though
she
were
his
daughter
,
and
indeed
no
one
could
help
loving
so
kind
and
good
a
creature
.
.When
Boris
Andreyitch
,
with
human
weakness
,
con-
fided
to
his
friend
his
secret
thoughts
and
grievances
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
blamed
him
se-
verely
for
his
ingratitude
,
enumerated
all
Verotchka
's
virtues
,
and
once
in
answer
to
a
remark
of
Boris
Andreyitch
's
that
he
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
had
thought
that
they
were
not
made
for
each
other
,
the
latter
answered
angrily
that
he
did
not
deserve
her
.
;
*'I
have
found
nothing
in
her
,
''
muttered
Boris
Andreyitch
.
``
Found
nothing
in
her
!
Why
,
did
yoti
ex-
pect
something
extraordinary
of
her
?
You've
found
an
excellent
wife
in
her
,
let
me
tell
you
that
!
''
``
That
's
true
,
''
Vyazovnin
hastily
assented
.
Everything
in
tlie
house
went
on
as
before
quietly
and
peacefully
.
For
it
was
not
only
impossible
to
quarrel
with
Verotchka
,
no
mis-
understandings
even
could
exist
between
her
and
her
husband
,
yet
the
inner
rift
was
felt
in
everything
.
So
the
effect
of
an
unseen
inter-
nal
wound
may
be
seen
in
a
man
's
whole
being
.
Verotchka
had
not
the
habit
of
complaining
;
besides
she
did
not
even
in
thought
blame
Vyazovnin
for
anything
,
and
it
never
entered
his
head
that
she
was
not
properly
satisfied
with
her
life
with
him
.
Only
two
people
clearly
un-
derstood
her
position
,
her
old
father
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
.
Stepan
Petrovitch
caressed
her
with
peculiar
sympathetic
compassion
and
looked
into
her
eyes
when
she
came
to
see
him
he
asked
her
no
questions
,
but
his
sighs
were
more
frequent
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
,
and
his
''
Bra-oo
,
Bra-oo
''
had
no
longer
the
note
of
the
imperturbable
calm
of
a
spirit
remote
from
all
things
earthly
.
^
He
seemed
to
have
become
pale
and
thin
since
he
had
been
parted
from
his
daughter
.
What
was
passing
in
her
soul
was
no
secret
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
either
.
Verotchka
did
not
in
the
least
expect
her
husband
to
pay
attention
to
her
or
even
to
talk
to
her
;
but
she
was
fretted
by
the
thought
that
she
was
a
burdeti
to
him
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
found
her
one
day
stand-
ing
motionless
with
her
face
to
the
wall
.
Like
her
father
whom
she
greatly
resembled
,
she
did
not
like
to
display
her
tears
,
and
turned
aside
when
she
wept
,
even
if
she
were
alone
in
the
room
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
walked
softly
by
her
,
and
never
dropped
the
slightest
hint
that
could
give
her
ground
for
supposing
that
he
knew
why
she
was
standing
with
her
face
to
the
wall
.
But
he
gave
Vyazovnin
no
peace
;
he
did
not
,
it
is
true
,
utter
those
offensively
irritating
,
unnecessary
words
,
``
I
told
you
so
!
''
words
which
,
let
us
observe
in
parenthesis
,
the
best
of
people
can
not
refrain
from
uttering
even
in
the
moment
of
warmest
sympathy
.
But
he
attacked
Boris
Andreyitch
mercilessly
for
his
indifference
and
ennui
and
once
affected
him
so
much
that
he
ran
to
Verotchka
and
began
anx-
iously
scrutinising
and
questioning
her
.
She
looked
at
him
so
gently
and
answered
him
so
calmly
that
he
went
away
inwardly
troubled
by
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
reproaches
,
but
thank-
ful
that
Verotchka
anyway
suspected
noth-
ing
.
.
.
.
So
passed
the
winter
.
Such
relations
can
not
last
long
;
they
either
end
in
a
rupture
or
undergo
a
change
,
rarely
for
the
better
.
.
.
.
Boris
Andreyitch
did
not
become
irritable
and
exacting
as
is
often
the
case
with
people
who
feel
they
are
in
the
wrong
;
he
did
not
per-
mit
himself
the
cheap
and
often
,
even
in
intelli-
gent
people
,
coarse
pleasure
of
mockery
and
gibing
;
he
did
not
sink
into
melancholy
;
he
sim-
ply
began
to
be
absorbed
by
the
thought
of
how
to
get
away
,
for
a
time
,
of
course
.
``
To
travel
!
''
he
repeated
to
himself
as
he
got
up
in
the
morning
.
``
To
travel
!
''
he
whis-
pered
as
he
got
into
bed
.
He
fotmd
an
enchanting
fascination
lay
hid
in
those
words
.
He
tried
by
way
of
distrac-
tion
visiting
Sofya
Kirillovna
,
but
her
fluent
speech
and
her
free-and-easy
manners
,
her
lit-
tle
smiles
and
airs
and
graces
,
seemed
to
him
very
mawkish
.
``
What
a
contrast
to
Ve-
rotchka
!
''
he
thought
,
looking
at
the
emand-
io6
pated
widow
,
and
yet
the
thought
of
getting
away
from
Verotchka
never
left
him
.
.
.
.
The
breath
of
the
coming
spring
spring
which
beckons
and
allures
the
very
birds
from
beyond
the
seas
dissipated
his
last
doubts
and
set
his
head
in
a
whirl
.
He
went
away
to
Petersburg
on
the
pretext
of
some
important
business
that
could
not
be
deferred
,
though
it
had
till
then
never
been
mentioned
.
.
.
.
As
he
parted
from
Verotchka
he
suddenly
felt
a
tightness
and
rush
of
blood
at
his
heart
:
he
felt
sorry
for
his
sweet
,
gentle
v/ife
;
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
and
bedewed
her
pale
forehead
,
which
he
had
only
just
touched
with
his
lips
.
v.-
''
I
shall
soon
soon
be
back
!
And
I
shall
write
,
my
darling
,
''
he
kept
repeating
.
And
commending
her
to
the
care
and
affec-
tion
of
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
he
got
into
his
car-
riage
,
touched
and
melancholy
.
.
.
.
His
melancholy
disappeared
instantly
at
the
sight
of
the
first
softly
green
willows
on
the
high-road
,
which
lay
a
mile
and
a
half
from
his
estate
.
An
unaccountable
,
almost
boyish
,
rapture
set
his
heart
throbbing
;
his
chest
heaved
and
he
fastened
his
eyes
greedily
on
the
distance
.
``
No
,
''
he
exclaimed
:
``
I
see
that
''
'The
fiery
steed
and
the
gentle
doe
.
Harnessed
together
,
can
not
go
.
'
``
But
was
he
a
fiery
steed
?
Vera
was
left
alone
;
but
in
the
first
place
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
visited
her
frequently
,
and
what
was
more
her
old
father
was
induced
to
tear
himself
from
his
beloved
abode
and
move
for
the
time
into
his
daughter
's
house
.
The
three
of
them
got
on
capitally
together
;
their
tastes
and
their
habits
were
so
completely
in
harmony
!
And
yet
Vyazovnin
was
not
for-
gotten
by
them
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
served
them
as
an
unseen
spiritual
tie
.
They
were
in-
cessantly
talking
of
him
,
of
his
cleverness
,
his
goodness
,
his
culture
and
the
simple
good
na-
ture
of
his
behaviour
.
They
seemed
to
have
be-
come
even
fonder
of
Boris
Andreyitch
in
his
ab-
sence
from
home
.
The
weather
set
in
fine
;
the
days
did
not
fly
by
,
no
,
they
passed
peacefully
and
joyfully
like
high
,
bright
clouds
on
a
blue
and
clear
sky
.
Vyazovnin
wrote
from
time
to
io8
time
;
his
letters
were
read
and
re-read
with
great
pleasure
.
In
each
of
them
he
spoke
of
his
ap-
proaching
return
.
...
At
last
one
day
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
received
the
following
letter
from
him
:
''
Dear
Friend
,
my
dear
kind
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
:
I
have
been
wondering
a
long
while
how
to
begin
this
letter
,
but
it
seems
that
the
best
way
is
to
tell
you
straight
out
that
I
am
going
abroad
.
The
news
I
know
will
surprise
you
and
even
make
you
angry
:
you
could
not
have
expected
this
,
and
you
will
be
perfectly
right
if
you
call
me
an
irresponsible
and
un-
reasonable
person
;
I
do
not
mean
,
indeed
,
to
defend
myself
and
even
at
this
moment
I
am
conscious
that
I
am
blushing
,
but
have
the
pa-
tience
to
hear
me
out
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
am
going
for
a
very
short
time
and
in
such
so-
ciety
and
such
favourable
conditions
as
you
can
hardly
imagine
;
and
in
the
second
,
I
am
firmly
convinced
that
after
playing
the
fool
for
the
last
time
,
after
satisfying
for
the
last
time
my
passion
for
seeing
everything
and
hav-
ing
every
experience
,
I
shall
become
an
excel-
lent
husband
,
and
a
stay-at-home
family
man
,
and
shall
show
that
I
know
how
to
value
the
undeserved
kindness
of
destiny
in
presenting
me
with
such
a
wife
as
Verotchka
.
``
Please
persuade
her
of
this
too
,
and
show
her
this
letter
.
I
am
not
writing
to
her
now
;
I
have
not
the
courage
:
but
I
shall
certainly
write
from
Stettin
for
which
our
steamer
is
bound
,
and
meanwhile
tell
her
that
I
am
on
my
knees
before
her
and
humbly
beg
her
not
to
be
cross
with
her
stupid
husband
.
Know-
ing
her
angelic
character
,
I
am
certain
she
will
forgive
me
and
I
swear
by
everything
in
the
world
that
in
three
months
,
not
a
day
later
,
I
will
be
back
at
Vyazovno
and
then
no
force
shall
drag
me
away
till
the
end
of
my
days
.
Good-
bye
or
rather
till
we
meet
soon
;
I
embrace
you
and
kiss
the
sweet
hands
of
my
Verotchka
.
``
I
shall
write
to
you
from
Stettin
where
you
can
send
me
letters
.
If
anything
unforeseen
should
happen
,
and
in
regard
to
the
manage-
ment
of
the
place
generally
,
I
rely
upon
you
as
upon
a
wall
of
stone

no
Alas
,
the
hopes
expressed
by
Boris
An-
dreyitch
in
this
letter
were
not
destined
to
be
fulfilled
.
Owing
to
the
great
number
of
impressions
he
received
and
things
he
had
to
do
,
he
had
not
time
to
write
to
Verotchka
from
Stettin
;
but
from
Hamburg
he
sent
her
a
letter
in
which
he
informed
her
of
his
intention
to
visit
for
the
sake
of
inspecting
certain
indus-
trial
institutions
and
also
listening
to
certain
necessary
lectures
Paris
,
where
he
begged
her
to
forward
letters
,
Poste
Restante
.
Vyazovnin
arrived
in
Paris
in
the
morning
and
,
after
in
the
course
of
the
day
running
through
the
Boulevards
,
the
Tuileries
,
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
and
the
Palais
Royal
,
and
even
ascending
the
Vendome
Column
,
he
dined
at
Vefeur
's
with
the
dignified
air
of
an
habitue
,
and
in
the
evening
visited
the
Chateau
des
Fleurs
to
see
,
as
a
disinterested
observer
,
what
the
``
can-can
''
really
was
like
and
how
the
Parisians
danced
it
.
The
dance
itself
Vyazov-
nin
did
not
think
attractive
;
but
one
of
the
Parisiennes
performing
the
can-can
,
a
lively
,
well-made
brunette
with
a
turned-up
nose
and
III
saucy
eyes
,
did
attract
him
.
He
came
to
a
standstill
near
her
more
and
more
frequently
,
exchanged
at
first
glances
with
her
,
then
smiles
,
then
words
.
.
.
.
Half
an
hour
later
she
was
walking
arm
in
arm
with
him
telling
him
``
son
petit
nom
''
Julie
,
and
hinting
that
she
was
hungry
and
that
nothing
could
be
better
than
a
supper
at
the
Maison
d'Or
``
dans
un
petit
cab-
inet
particulier
.
''
Boris
Andreyitch
was
not
at
all
hungry
him-
self
,
and
indeed
supper
in
the
society
of
Mdlle
.
Julie
had
not
entered
into
his
calculations
.
.
.
.
``
However
,
if
that
's
the
way
here
,
''
he
thought
,
``
I
suppose
I
shall
have
to
go
Par-
tons
,
''
he
said
aloud
,
but
at
the
same
instant
someone
trod
very
heavily
on
his
foot
.
He
cried
out
,
turned
round
and
saw
facing
him
a
thick-set
,
broad-shouldered
,
middle-aged
gentle-
man
in
a
stiff
cravat
in
the
frock-coat
of
a
ci-
vilian
buttoned
all
the
way
up
and
full
trousers
of
military
cut
.
Pulling
his
hat
right
down
to
his
nose
from
under
which
his
dyed
moustaches
fell
in
two
little
cascades
,
and
bulging
out
his
trousers
pockets
with
the
big
fingers
of
his
hairy
hands
,
this
gentleman
,
by
every
token
an
infantry
officer
,
stared
stubbornly
at
Vyazovnin
.
The
expression
of
his
yellow
eyes
,
of
his
rough
,
flat
cheeks
,
of
his
bluish
,
prominent
jaws
,
of
his
whole
face
,
was
coarse
and
insolent
.
``
Was
it
you
trod
on
my
foot
?
''
said
Vyazov-
nin
.
``
Out
,
Monsieur
.
''
``
But
in
such
cases
.
.
.
people
apologise
.
''
``
And
if
I
wo
n't
apologise
to
you
,
Monsieur
le
MoscoiAte
.
''
Parisians
recognise
Russians
at
once
.
``
Then
did
you
wish
to
insult
me
?
''
asked
Vyazovnin
,
''
Oui
,
Monsieur
.
...
I
do
n't
like
the
shape
of
your
nose
.
''
``
Fi
.
.
.
.
Le
gros
jaloux
,
''
murmured
Mdlle
.
Julie
,
to
whom
the
infantry
officer
was
evi-
dently
not
a
stranger
.
``
But
then
.
.
.
''
Vyazovnin
began
,
as
though
bewildered
.
``
Then
we
must
fight
,
''
the
officer
caught
him
up
.
``
Of
course
.
Very
good
.
Here
is
my
card
.
''
``
And
here
is
mine
,
''
answered
Vyazovnin
,
still
bewildered
and
as
though
in
a
dream
with
a
confused
throbbing
of
his
heart
,
he
scribbled
on
the
polished
paper
of
his
visiting
card
with
a
little
gold
pencil
he
had
just
bought
for
his
watch
chain
,
Hotel
des
Trots
Monarques
No
.
.
The
officer
nodded
and
announced
that
he
would
have
the
honour
of
sending
his
seconds
to
``
Monsieur
.
.
.
Monsieur
.
.
.
''
he
raised
Vyazovnin
's
card
to
his
right
eye
,
``
Monsieur
de
Vazavononin
''
and
turned
his
back
on
Boris
Andreyitch
,
who
at
once
left
the
Chateau
des
Fleurs
.
Mdlle
.
Julie
tried
to
detain
him
but
he
looked
at
her
very
coldly
.
.
.
she
promptly
turned
away
from
him
,
and
was
for
a
long
time
afterwards
sitting
by
the
wall
,
explaining
some-
thing
to
the
angry
officer
,
who
as
before
kept
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
did
not
smile
.
On
getting
into
the
street
,
Vyazovnin
stopped
under
the
first
gas
lamp
he
came
to
and
for
a
second
time
and
with
great
attention
read
the
card
that
had
been
handed
him
.
On
it
stood
the
following
words
:
Alexandre
Lebccuf
,
capiiaine
en
second
au
Ssme
de
Lignc
.
``
Is
it
possible
that
this
can
lead
to
any-
thing
?
''
he
thought
to
himself
.
``
Can
I
really
be
going
to
fight
a
duel
?
And
what
for
?
And
on
the
very
day
after
my
arrival
in
Paris
!
What
folly
!
''
He
began
a
letter
to
Verotchka
,
to
Pyotr
Vas-
silyitch
and
at
once
tore
up
the
pages
he
had
begun
and
flung
them
away
.
``
Nonsense
!
It
's
a
farce
!
''
he
repeated
,
and
went
to
bed
.
But
his
thoughts
took
a
different
turn
when
next
morning
at
breakfast
two
gentlemen
very
much
like
Monsieur
Lebceuf
,
only
younger
(
all
French
infantry
officers
have
the
same
face
)
called
upon
him
and
announcing
their
names
(
one
was
called
Monsieur
LeCoq
,
the
other
Monsieur
Pinochet
,
both
were
lieutenants
``
au
$
me
de
Ligne
''
)
introduced
themselves
to
Boris
Andreyitch
as
the
seconds
``
de
notre
ami
Monsieur
Lebceuf
'
sent
by
him
to
take
all
nec-
essary
steps
since
their
friend
Monsieur
Le-
boeuf
would
accept
no
apologies
.
``
5
Vyazovnin
was
obliged
to
inform
Messieurs
les
ofRciers
,
the
friends
of
Monsieur
Leboeuf
,
that
being
a
complete
novice
in
Paris
he
had
not
yet
had
time
to
look
round
and
provide
him-
self
with
a
second
;
(
``
I
suppose
one
is
enough
?
''
he
added
;
``
Quite
enough
,
responded
Mon-
sieur
Pinochet
)
,
and
therefore
he
would
have
to
ask
Messieurs
les
ofdciers
to
let
him
have
four
hours
to
find
one
.
Messieurs
les
ofhciers
exchanged
glances
,
shrugged
their
shoulders
,
consented
,
however
,
and
got
up
from
their
seats
.
``
Si
Mofisieur
le
desire
,
''
Monsieur
Pinochet
brought
out
suddenly
,
stopping
short
before
the
door
(
of
the
two
seconds
he
was
obviously
the
readier
with
his
tongue
and
he
had
been
commissioned
to
carry
on
the
negotiations
,
Monsieur
LeCoq
merely
grunted
approvingly
)
,
''
Si
Monsieur
le
desire
,
''
he
repeated
(
Vyazov-
nin
was
reminded
of
Monsieur
Galisi
,
his
Mos-
cow
barber
,
who
often
made
use
of
that
phrase
)
,
``
we
can
recommend
one
of
the
offi-
cers
of
our
regiment
,
le
lieutenant
Barbichon
,
un
gargon
tres
devoue
,
who
would
certainly
consent
to
do
a
service
a
un
gentleman
(
Mon-
Ii6
sieur
Pinochet
pronounced
this
word
as
if
it
were
French
)
,
to
help
him
out
of
a
difficulty
,
and
if
he
becomes
your
second
he
will
take
your
interests
to
heart
prendre
a
cccur
vos
interets
.
''
Vyazovnin
was
at
first
amazed
at
such
a
pro-
posal
,
but
reflecting
that
he
knew
no
one
in
Paris
,
thanked
Monsieur
Pinochet
and
said
he
would
expect
Monsieur
Barbichon
and
Mon-
sieur
Barbichon
was
not
slow
in
making
his
appearance
.
This
gargon
^rcs
devoue
turned
out
to
be
an
extremely
alert
and
active
person
,
declaring
that
``
cet
animal
de
Lebmif
n'en
fait
jamais
d'autres
.
.
.
c'est
un
Othello
,
Monsieur
,
tin
veritable
Othello
.
''
He
asked
Vyazovnin
:
''
N'est-cc
pas
que
voiis
desires
que
I
'
affaire
soit
serieuse
?
''
And
,
without
waiting
for
an
an-
swer
,
exclaimed
:
''
C'est
tout
ce
que
je
desirais
savoir
.
Laisses
moi
f
aire
I
''
And
he
did
in
fact
conduct
the
affair
with
such
energy
,
and
took
Vyazovnin's
interests
to
heart
with
such
warmth
,
that
four
hours
later
poor
Boris
Andreyitch
,
who
had
no
notion
of
fencing
,
was
standing
in
the
very
middle
of
a
green
glade
in
the
Bois
de
Vin-
cennes
with
his
coat
off
and
the
sleeves
of
his
shirt
tucked
up
,
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
two
paces
from
his
opponent
.
Bright
sunshine
lighted
up
the
scene
.
Vyazovnin
had
no
clear
idea
of
how
he
had
come
there
:
he
kept
re-
peating
to
himself
:
``
How
stupid
it
is
!
How
stupid
it
is
!
''
And
he
felt
ashamed
as
though
he
were
taking
part
in
some
dull
,
practical
joke
,
and
an
awkward
,
inwardly
hidden
grin
played
about
his
soul
while
his
eyes
were
riv-
etted
on
the
low
brow
and
the
cropped
black
hair
of
the
Frenchman
who
stood
before
him
.
``
Tout
est
pret
,
''
a
lisping
voice
announced
,
''
Allez
,
''
piped
another
.
Monsieur
Lebceuf
's
face
assumed
an
expres-
sion
not
so
much
ferocious
as
predatory
;
Vyazovnin
flourished
his
sword
(
Pinochet
had
assured
him
that
his
ignorance
of
the
art
of
fencing
gave
him
``
de
grands
avantages
!
''
)
when
all
at
once
something
extraordinary
hap-
pened
.
'^
There
was
a
rattle
,
a
stamp
,
a
flash
Vyazovnin
felt
in
his
chest
on
the
right
side
the
presence
of
a
sort
of
cold
big
stick
.
He
wanted
to
push
it
away
,
to
say
``
Do
n't
,
''
but
he
was
already
lying
on
his
back
and
experi-
ii8
encing
a
strange
almost
absurd
sensation
as
though
they
were
trying
to
pull
teeth
out
of
his
whole
body
.
.
.
.
Then
the
earth
began
softly
heaving
under
him
.
...
A
voice
said
:
''
Tout
c'est
passe
dans
les
regies
,
n'est-ce
pas
,
Messienrs
?
''
A
second
answered
,
``
Oh
,
par-
faitement
.
''
And
crash
!
Everything
seemed
to
fly
round
and
then
sank
into
the
earth
.
``
Verotchka
!
''
Vyazovnin
hardly
had
time
to
think
with
anguish
.
.
.
.
Towards
evening
the
gargon
tres
devoue
brought
him
to
the
hotel
des
trois
Monarques
,
He
died
in
the
night
.
He
passed
away
to
that
land
from
which
no
traveller
has
yet
returned
.
He
did
not
regain
consciousness
before
his
death
and
only
muttered
twice
:
``
I
'll
go
back
directly
.
.
.
it
's
nothing
...
to
the
country
now
.
.
.
.
''
The
Russian
priest
for
whom
the
hotel-keeper
sent
gave
information
of
all
this
to
the
Russian
embassy
and
two
days
later
the
``
unhappy
affair
with
a
Russian
visitor
''
was
in
all
the
newspapers
.
It
had
been
a
hard
and
bitter
task
for
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
to
tell
Verotchka
of
her
husband's
letter
;
but
when
the
news
of
Vyazovnin
's
death
reached
him
,
he
was
utterly
distracted
.
The
first
to
read
of
it
in
the
papers
was
Mihey
Miheyitch
,
and
he
at
once
galloped
off
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
accompanied
by
Onufry
Ilyitch
with
whom
he
had
again
made
friends
.
As
people
usually
do
,
he
began
shouting
as
soon
as
he
got
into
the
hall
:
``
Only
fancy
!
What
a
disaster
!
''
and
so
on
.
For
a
long
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
not
believe
him
,
but
when
no
possibility
of
doubt
was
left
him
,
he
waited
a
whole
day
,
then
set
off
at
last
to
Verotchka
.
The
mere
sight
of
him
,
crushed
and
broken
,
so
alarmed
her
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
on
her
feet
.
He
tried
to
prepare
her
for
the
fatal
news
but
his
strength
failed
him
;
he
sat
down
and
through
his
tears
faltered
:
``
He
is
dead
,
he
is
dead
.
.
.
.
''
A
year
has
passed
.
From
the
roots
of
the
felled
tree
new
shoots
spring
up
,
the
deepest
wound
is
healed
in
time
,
life
replaces
death
even
as
it
is
replaced
by
it
,
and
Verotchka's
heart
had
gradually
grown
easier
and
begun
to
heal
.
Moreover
Vyazovnin
did
not
belong
to
the
number
of
people
who
are
irreplaceable
.
(
And
indeed
are
there
such
people
?
)
Nor
was
Ve-
rotchka
capable
of
devoting
herself
for
ever
to
one
feeling
.
(
And
indeed
are
there
such
feelings
?
)
She
had
married
Vyazovnin
without
con-
straint
and
without
great
enthusiasm
.
She
had
been
faithful
and
devoted
to
him
,
but
she
had
not
been
entirely
absorbed
in
him
.
She
grieved
for
him
genuinely
,
but
not
frantically
.
What
more
would
you
have
?
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
did
not
give
up
coming
to
see
her
;
he
was
as
before
her
closest
friend
,
and
so
it
was
not
at
all
surprising
that
,
being
left
one
day
alone
with
her
,
he
looked
into
her
face
and
very
quietly
suggested
that
she
should
be
his
wife
.
.
.
.
She
smiled
in
answer
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
.
Their
life
after
their
marriage
went
on
much
as
before
.
There
was
no
need
to
change
it
.
Ten
years
have
passed
since
then
.
Old
Barsukov
is
living
with
them
and
grows
younger
every
year
.
He
is
never
many
steps
apart
from
his
grandchildren
,
of
which
there
are
three
already
;
two
girls
and
a
boy
.
He
even
talks
to
them
,
especially
to
his
favourite
,
the
dark-eyed
,
curly-headed
boy
who
has
been
named
in
his
honour
Stepan
.
The
little
rogue
is
very
well
aware
that
his
grandfather
adores
him
and
so
ventures
upon
mimicking
how
he
walks
about
the
room
exclaiming
``
Bra-oo
,
Bra-oo
.
''
This
bit
of
mischief
always
excites
the
greatest
merriment
in
the
house
.
Poor
Vyazovnin
is
not
forgotten
to
this
day
,
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
honours
his
memory
,
always
speaks
of
him
with
peculiar
feeling
and
at
every
op-
portunity
is
sure
to
say
that
the
dear
fellow
was
fond
of
this
,
or
had
the
habit
of
doing
that
.
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
,
his
Wife
and
all
his
household
lead
a
very
monotonous
life
,
quiet
and
peaceful
;
they
are
happy
.
.
.
for
there
is
no
other
happiness
on
earth
.

'S
STORY
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
.
.
.
Twenty
years
ago
it
was
my
lot
to
make
an
unofficial
tour
of
inspection
of
the
rather
numerous
estates
belonging
to
my
aunt
.
The
parish
priests
,
with
whom
I
considered
it
my
duty
to
make
acquaintance
,
turned
out
all
to
be
rather
alike
aiid
seemed
as
though
they
had
all
been
made
on
the
same
pattern
,
but
finally
,
in
almost
the
last
estate
that
I
inspected
,
I
found
a
priest
who
was
unlike
the
others
.
He
was
a
very
old
,
almost
decrepit
man
,
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
earnest
entreaties
of
his
parishioners
who
loved
and
respected
him
,
he
would
long
before
have
asked
to
be
relieved
of
his
duties
,
I
was
struck
by
two
peculiarities
in
Father
Alexey
(
that
was
the
priest's
name
)
.
To
begin
with
,
he
not
merely
re-
frained
from
asking
anything
for
himself
but
declared
in
so
many
words
that
he
needed
noth-
ing
;
and
in
the
second
place
,
I
had
never
seen
in
any
human
face
such
a
look
of
sadness
and
complete
detachment
such
a
look
of
being
ut-
terly
``
broken
,
''
as
it
is
called
.
The
features
of
his
face
were
of
the
ordinary
country
type
:
a
wrinkled
forehead
,
little
grey
eyes
,
a
thick
nose
,
a
wedge-shaped
beard
,
a
swarthy
,
sun-
burnt
skin
.
But
the
expression
,
the
expres-
sion
!
There
was
but
a
faint
melancholy
glim-
mer
of
life
in
his
lustreless
eyes
;
his
voice
,
too
,
seemed
colourless
and
scarcely
living
.
I
was
taken
ill
and
laid
up
for
a
few
days
;
Father
Alexey
used
to
come
and
see
me
in
the
eve-
nings
not
to
talk
but
to
play
a
game
of
cards
called
``
fools
.
''
Playing
cards
seemed
to
en-
tertain
him
even
more
than
me
.
One
evening
after
having
been
made
``
the
fool
''
several
times
in
succession
,
at
which
Father
Alexey
was
much
gratified
,
I
began
talking
of
his
past
life
,
of
the
troubles
which
had
left
on
him
such
unmistakable
traces
.
Father
Alexey
held
back
for
a
long
time
,
but
ended
by
telling
me
his
story
.
He
must
have
taken
a
liking
to
me
or
he
would
not
have
been
so
open
with
me
.
I
will
try
and
repeat
his
story
in
his
own
words
.
Father
Alexey
spoke
very
simply
and
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
clearly
,
without
any
clerical
or
provincial
man-
nerisms
or
phrases
.
I
have
observed
more
than
once
that
Russians
of
all
classes
who
have
gone
through
a
great
deal
and
have
learned
resigna-
tion
express
themselves
just
in
that
language
.
...
I
had
a
good
and
sensible
wife
(
was
how
he
began
)
;
I
loved
her
from
my
heart
and
we
had
eight
children
,
but
almost
all
of
them
died
when
they
were
little
.
One
of
my
sons
became
a
bishop
and
died
not
long
ago
in
his
diocese
;
about
my
other
son
,
Yakov
,
I
am
going
to
tell
you
now
.
I
sent
him
to
the
semi-
nary
in
the
town
of
T.
and
soon
began
re-
ceiving
the
most
gratifying
reports
of
him
:
he
was
the
top
of
his
class
in
all
the
subjects
!
At
home
as
a
child
he
had
been
remarkable
for
his
studiousness
and
modesty
;
sometimes
you
would
hear
nothing
of
him
all
day
...
he
would
be
sitting
at
his
book
,
reading
.
He
never
caused
his
mother
or
me
the
slightest
annoy-
ance
;
he
was
always
a
good
boy
.
Only
some-
times
he
was
too
thoughtful
for
his
age
,
his
health
was
frail
.
One
day
something
strange
happened
to
him
.
He
was
ten
years
old
at
the
time
.
He
left
home
at
dawn
it
was
the
eve
of
St.
Peter
's
day
and
was
away
almost
the
whole
morning
.
At
last
he
came
back
.
My
wife
and
I
asked
him
where
he
had
been
.
``
I
went
for
a
walk
in
the
forest
,
''
he
told
us
,
''
and
there
I
met
a
little
green
old
man
who
talked
to
me
a
great
deal
and
gave
me
such
delicious
nuts
.
''
``
What
little
green
old
man
?
''
we
asked
him
.
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
have
never
seen
him
before
.
He
is
a
little
hunchbacked
old
man
,
he
keeps
laughing
and
his
feet
are
never
itill
and
he
is
green
as
a
leaf
all
over
.
''
``
What
?
''
we
said
;
``
was
his
face
green
too
?
''
``
Yes
,
his
face
,
and
his
hair
and
even
his
eyes
.
''
Our
son
had
neVer
told
a
lie
,
but
this
time
my
wife
and
I
were
doubtful
.
'
``
You
must
have
fallen
asleep
in
the
forest
in
the
heat
and
dreamed
of
the
old
man
.
''
``
I
did
n't
go
to
sleep
,
not
a
wink
,
''
he
said
.
``
Why
,
do
n't
you
believe
me
?
Why
,
I
have
one
of
the
nuts
left
in
my
pocket
.
''
Yakov
took
the
nut
out
of
his
pocket
and
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
showed
it
us
.
It
had
a
small
kernel
some-
thing
like
a
chestnut
with
a
rough
skin
;
it
was
not
like
our
ordinary
nuts
.
I
put
it
away
,
I
wanted
to
show
it
to
the
doctor
.
.
.
but
it
was
lost
,
I
could
not
find
it
afterwards
.
Well
,
we
sent
him
to
the
seminary
,
and
,
as
I
have
told
you
already
,
he
delighted
us
with
his
success
.
So
my
wife
and
I
expected
he
would
turn
out
well
.
When
he
came
home
for
his
holidays
it
was
a
pleasure
to
look
at
him
:
there
was
so
much
goodness
in
his
face
and
there
was
no
fault
you
could
find
with
him
.
Only
he
was
thin
and
there
was
no
proper
colour
in
his
face
.
Well
,
he
reached
his
nine-
teenth
year
and
his
studies
were
nearly
over
.
And
all
at
once
we
got
a
letter
from
him
.
He
wrote
to
us
,
``
Father
and
mother
,
do
not
be
angry
with
me
,
allow
me
to
take
up
a
secular
calling
,
my
heart
is
not
in
the
vocation
of
a
priest
,
I
am
terrified
at
the
responsibility
,
I
am
afraid
of
sin
doubts
have
begun
to
stir
in
me
!
Without
your
parental
permission
and
blessing
T
shall
not
venture
on
anything
;
but
I
will
tell
you
one
thing
:
I
am
afraid
of
my-
self
,
for
I
have
begun
to
think
a
great
deal
.
''
I
must
tell
you
,
sir
,
I
was
terribly
grieved
at
this
letter
;
it
was
like
a
stab
in
the
heart
,
for
I
saw
I
should
oot
have
anyone
to
take
my
place
after
me
.
Lly
elder
son
was
a
monk
,
and
this
one
wanted
to
leave
the
priesthood
altogether
.
It
was
a
grief
to
me
,
too
,
because
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
the
priests
in
this
parish
have
been
of
our
family
!
However
,
I
thought
it
was
no
use
kicking
against
the
pricks
;
it
seemed
that
this
was
ordained
for
him
.
What
sort
of
pas
.
tor
would
he
make
if
he
had
let
doubts
assail
him
!
I
took
council
with
my
wife
and
I
wrote
to
him
in
this
sense
:
``
Yakov
,
my
son
,
think
it
over
well
,
measure
ten
times
before
you
cut
once
;
there
are
great
difficulties
in
a
secular
calling
,
cold
and
hunger
and
contempt
for
our
class
!
And
you
must
understand
that
no
one
will
give
you
a
helping
hand
;
mind
you
don't
repent
too
late
!
My
desire
,
as
you
know
,
has
always
been
that
you
should
succeed
me
here
;
but
if
you
really
doubt
of
your
vocation
and
your
faith
has
been
shaken
it
is
not
for
me
to
try
and
compel
you.V
:
God
's
will
be
done
!
Your
mother
and
I
do
not
refuse
you
our
blessing
.
''
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
Yakov
answered
me
with
a
grateful
letter
.
``
You
have
relieved
me
,
father
,
''
he
wrote
;
``
it
is
my
intention
to
devote
myself
to
a
learned
career
and
I
have
help
promised
me
;
I
shall
enter
the
University
and
become
a
doctor
,
for
I
feel
a
great
inclination
for
science
.
''
I
read
Yasha
's
letter
and
was
more
grieved
than
ever
;
and
soon
I
had
no
one
to
share
my
sorrow
:
my
old
wife
caught
cold
about
that
time
and
died
whether
of
the
cold
or
because
the
Lord
took
her
in
His
mercy
,
I
can
not
tell
.
I
wept
and
wept
in
my
solitary
bereavement
but
t
,
here
was
no
help
for
it
.
So
it
was
to
be
,
it
seems
.
I
should
have
been
glad
to
be
under
the
soil
too
.
.
.
but
the
earth
was
hard
.
.
.
it
would
not
open
.
And
I
was
expecting
my
son
,
for
he
sent
me
word
'before
I
go
to
Mos-
cow
I
shall
come
home
to
see
you
.
'
And
he
did
indeed
come
home
,
but
he
did
not
stay
long
.
Something
seemed
urging
him
on
;
it
seemed
as
though
he
longed
to
fly
to
Moscow
,
to
his
be-
loved
University
!
I
began
questioning
him
about
his
doubts
and
asked
him
what
was
the
reason
of
them
,
but
I
could
not
get
much
talk
out
of
him
:
his
mind
was
pos-
sessed
by
one
idea
and
that
was
all
!
'I
want
to
help
my
fellow-creatures
,
'
he
said
.
Well
,
he
went
away
he
scarcely
took
a
farthing
with
him
nothing
but
a
few
clothes
.
He
had
great
confidence
in
himself
!
And
not
without
good
reason
.
He
passed
the
examination
brilliantly
,
became
a
student
,
got
lessons
in
private
fam-
ilies
.
.
.
.
He
was
good
at
Greek
and
Latin
.
And
,
would
you
believe
it
,
he
actually
sent
me
money
.
I
felt
a
little
more
cheerful
not
on
account
of
the
money
,
of
course
,
I
sent
it
back
to
him
and
scolded
him
too
;
I
was
cheered
because
I
saw
he
would
do
well
.
But
my
cheerfulness
did
not
last
long
.
He
came
home
for
his
first
vacation
.
And
it
was
strange
I
hardly
knew
my
Yakov
.
He
had
become
so
depressed
,
so
gloomy
there
was
no
getting
a
word
out
of
him
.
And
his
face
was
changed
too
he
looked
almost
ten
years
older
.
He
had
always
been
of
a
retiring
dis-
position
,
that
's
true
;
the
least
thing
,
and
he
would
be
shy
and
blushing
like
a
girl
.
.
.
.
But
if
he
raised
his
eyes
you
'
:
ould
see
that
his
soul
was
serene
.
Now
it
was
not
the
same
thing
,
though
.
He
was
not
shy
but
like
some
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
wild
creature
,
like
a
wolf
,
and
he
looked
at
everyone
from
under
his
brows
.
Not
a
smile
,
not
a
greeting
,
like
a
stone
!
When
I
tried
to
question
him
he
would
either
say
nothing
or
growl
at
me
.
I
began
to
wonder
whether
God
forbid
he
had
taken
to
drinking
,
or
whether
he
had
given
way
to
gambling
or
whether
he
had
got
into
some
trouble
through
weakness
in
regard
to
women
.
In
youth
the
spell
of
love
is
potent
and
there
are
sure
to
be
bad
examples
and
temptations
in
a
big
town
like
Moscow
.
But
no
,
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
to
be
seen
.
He
drank
nothing
but
water
or
kvass
;
had
no
eyes
for
the
fair
sex
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
people
in
general
.
And
what
was
bitterer
than
anything
,
he
no
longer
put
the
same
confidence
in
me
,
he
seemed
indifferent
,
as
though
he
were
sick
of
everything
belonging
to
him
,
I
would
turn
the
conversation
on
his
studies
,
on
the
University
,
but
I
could
get
no
real
answer
out
of
him
.
He
would
go
to
church
,
but
there
was
something
strange
about
that
too
:
everywhere
else
he
was
morose
and
sullen
,
but
in
church
he
looked
as
though
he
were
grin-
ning
all
the
time
.
He
spent
six
weeks
with
me
Hke
that
and
went
back
to
Moscow
again
.
He
wfote
to
me
twice
from
Moscow
and
it
seemed
to
me
from
his
letters
as
though
he
were
com-
ing
to
himself
again
.
But
picture
my
amaze-
ment
,
sir
!
Suddenly
in
the
very
depth
of
win-
ter
,
just
before
Christmas
,
he
came
home
.
How
?
Why
?
In
what
way
?
I
knew
that
there
was
no
vacation
at
that
time
.
``
Have
you
come
from
Moscow
?
''
I
asked
.
``
Yes
.
''
``
And
how
.
.
.
about
the
University
?
''
``
I
have
given
up
the
University
.
''
``
Given
it
up
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
For
good
?
''
``
Yes
,
for
good
.
''
``
Are
you
ill
then
,
or
what

Yakov
?
''

''
Yako.v
said
he
was
not
ill
but
I
was
h6rrified
at
the
look
of
his
face
.
His
cheeks
were
drawn
so
that
the
bones
stuck
out
,
he
was

skin

STORY
and
bones
,
his
voice
had
a
hollow
note
like
a
barrel
,
and
.
his
eyes
.
.
.
good
God
,
what
eyes
!
Fierce
,
wild
,
continually
roving
so
that
you
could
never
catch
them
;
his
brows
were
knit
,
his
lips
,
too
,
seemed
twisted
on
one
side
.
.
.
.
What
had
become
of
my
beloved
Joseph
,
my
gentle
boy
?
I
could
n't
imagine
.
Is
he
out
of
his
mind
?
I
wondered
.
He
wandered
about
like
an
uneasy
spirit
,
did
not
sleep
at
night
and
all
of
a
sudden
would
stare
into
a
corner
and
seem
to
grow
stiff
with
terror
.
.
.
.
It
was
uncanny
!
Though
he
did
threaten
me
that
he
would
not
stay
if
I
asked
him
questions
,
yet
I
was
his
father
.
My
last
hope
was
being
shattered
and
was
I
to
keep
silent
?
One
day
,
choosing
my
time
,
I
began
imploring
Yakov
with
tears
,
entreating
him
for
the
sake
of
his
mother
,
``
Tell
me
,
your
father
in
flesh
and
in
spirit
,
Yasha
,
what
is
wrong
with
you
?
Don't
destroy
me
,
explain
,
open
your
heart
!
Have
you
slain
some
Christian
soul
,
perhaps
?
Then
repent
!
''
``
Well
,
father
,
''
he
said
all
at
once
(
it
was
in
the
evening
)
,
``
you
have
touched
my
heart
;
I
will
tell
you
the
whole
truth
!
I
have
hurt
no
other
soul
,
but
my
own
is
being
lost
.
''
``
In
what
way
?
''
``
It
's
like
this
.
.
.
''
and
Yakov
raised
his
eyes
to
me
for
the
first
time
``
for
the
last
four
months
,
''
he
began
,
but
all
at
once
his
voice
broke
and
he
began
breathing
hard
,
''
What
is
it
for
the
last
four
months
?
Tell
me
,
do
n't
torture
me
.
''
``
For
the
last
four
months
I
have
been
seeing
him
.
''
``
Him
!
What
him
?
''
``
Why
,
him
,
whose
name
one
ca
n't
utter
at
night
.
''
I
turned
cold
all
over
and
began
to
tremble
.
``
What
?
''
I
said
,
``
do
you
see
himt
''
''
Yes
.
''
``
And
do
you
see
him
now
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
Where
?
''
And
I
did
not
dare
to
turn
round
myself
,
and
we
both
spoke
in
a
whisper
.
``
Over
there
,
''
he
said
,
and
showed
me
with
his
eyes
,
``
over
there
,
in
the
corner
.
''
Father
alexey
's
story
I
plucked
up
my
spirit
and
looked
into
the
corner
;
there
was
nothing
there
!
``
But
there
's
nothing
there
,
Yakov
,
really
!
''
``
You
do
n't
see
him
,
but
I
do
.
''
I
looked
again
again
there
was
nothing
.
I
suddenly
thought
of
the
little
old
man
in
the
wood
who
gave
him
the
nut
.
``
What
is
he
Hke
?
''
I
said
.
``
Green
?
''
``
No
,
not
green
black
.
''
``
With
horns
?
''
``
No
,
he
is
like
a
man
,
but
all
black
.
''
As
Yakov
spoke
,
his
mouth
was
twisted
so
that
his
teeth
showed
;
he
was
pale
as
death
and
he
huddled
up
to
me
in
terror
;
his
eyes
seemed
as
though
they
were
starting
out
of
his
head
but
he
still
looked
into
the
corner
.
``
That
's
the
shadow
makes
you
fancy
it
,
''
I
said
;
``
it
's
the
blackness
of
the
shadow
and
you
take
it
for
a
human
form
.
''
``
Not
at
all
!
I
see
his
eyes
;
there
,
he
is
show-
ing
the
whites
of
his
eyes
,
there
,
he
is
lifting
his
hands
and
beckoning
.
''
'^Yakov
,
Yakov
,
you
should
try
and
pray
;
it
would
break
the
spell
.
Let
the
Lord
arise
and
His
enemies
be
scattered
!
''
^Z7
''
I
have
tried
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
it
is
no
use
.
''
``
Wait
,
wait
,
Yakov
,
do
n't
be
faint-hearted
;
I
will
burn
incense
,
I
will
say
a
prayer
,
I
will
sprinkle
holy
water
around
you
.
''
Yakov
merely
waved
his
hand
in
despair
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
in
your
incense
nor
in
your
holy
water
;
they
are
not
a
hap'orth
of
use
to
me
now
.
There
's
no
parting
from
htm
for
me
now
.
Since
he
came
to
me
on3
cursed
day
in
summer
he
has
been
my
constant
visitor
and
there
is
no
getting
rid
of
him
.
Understand
that
,
father
,
and
do
n't
be
surprised
at
my
be-
haviour
and
do
n't
torment
me
.
''
``
What
day
did
he
come
to
you
?
''
I
asked
,
and
I
kept
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
.
``
Was
it
when
you
were
writing
to
me
about
your
doubts
?
''
Yakov
put
aside
my
hand
.
``
Leave
me
alone
,
father
,
''
he
said
,
``
don't
make
me
angry
,
for
fear
worse
may
happen
.
I
am
not
far
from
laying
hands
on
myself
.
''
You
can
imagine
,
sir
,
what
it
was
for
me
to
hear
that
!
I
remember
I
cried
all
night
.
How
have
I
deserved
the
wrath
of
God
?
I
wondered
.
Here
Father
Alexcy
took
a
check
handker-
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
chief
out
of
his
pocket
,
blew
his
nose
and
steahhily
wiped
his
eyes
.
A
sad
life
we
had
after
that
!
he
went
on
.
IMy
mind
was
full
of
nothing
else
but
the
dread
that
he
should
run
away
or
God
forbid
do
himself
some
mischief
.
I
kept
watch
over
every
step
he
took
but
I
was
afraid
of
talking
to
him
.
At
that
time
there
was
living
near
us
a
lady
,
the
widow
of
a
colonel
,
called
Marfa
Savvishna
.
I
had
a
great
respect
for
her
,
for
she
was
a
gentle
and
sensible
woman
,
though
she
was
young
and
of
prepossessing
appear-
ance
.
I
used
to
visit
her
often
and
she
did
not
despise
me
for
being
a
priest
.
In
my
grief
and
misery
,
not
knowing
what
to
do
,
I
went
and
told
her
all
about
it
.
At
first
she
was
horrified
and
quite
overwhelmed
;
and
then
she
began
to
think
.
For
a
long
time
she
sat
silent
;
and
then
she
expressed
a
desire
to
see
my
son
and
talk
to
him
.
And
I
felt
at
once
that
I
must
do
as
she
wished
,
for
it
was
no
feminine
curiosity
that
prompted
her
request
,
but
something
else
.
When
I
got
home
I
began
persuading
Yakov
:
''
Come
with
me
to
see
the
colonel
's
lady
.
''
He
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
``
I
wo
n't
,
''
he
said
,
``
noth-
ing
would
induce
me
!
What
could
I
talk
to
her
about
?
''
He
even
shouted
at
me
.
How-
ever
,
I
succeeded
in
persuading
him
at
last
and
,
putting
the
horse
in
the
sledge
,
I
took
him
to
Marfa
Savvishna
and
,
as
arranged
,
left
him
alone
with
her
.
I
was
surprised
myself
that
he
had
agreed
so
soon
.
``
Never
mind
,
we
shall
see
what
comes
of
it
,
''
I
thought
.
Three
or
four
hours
later
my
Yakov
came
back
.
``
WeU
,
''
I
asked
him
,
``
how
did
you
like
our-
neighbour
?
''
He
made
no
answer
.
I
tried
again
.
``
She
is
a
virtuous
lady
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
suppose
she
was
kind
to
you
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
she
is
not
like
other
people
.
''
I
saw
he
seemed
to
be
softer
,
and
I
ventured
to
ask
him
about
his
affliction
.
The
look
in
Yakov
's
eye
was
like
the
lash
of
a
whip
and
again
he
said
nothing
.
I
did
not
trouble
him
further
and
went
out
of
the
room
;
an
hour
later
I
went
to
the
door
,
looked
through
the
key-hole
and
what
do
you
think
?
My
Yakov
was
asleep
.
He
was
lying
asleep
on
his
bed
.
I
crossed
myself
several
times
.
May
God
shower
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
every
blessing
upon
Marfa
Savvishna
!
I
thought
.
So
the
dear
woman
had
succeeded
in
touching
his
hardened
heart
!
Next
day
I
saw
Yakov
take
his
cap
,
I
thought
of
asking
where
he
was
going
,
but
no
better
not
ask
...
no
doubt
it
is
to
her
!
And
it
really
was
to
Marfa
Savvishna
that
Yakov
went
,
and
he
stayed
longer
still
;
and
the
next
day
he
went
again
,
and
then
a
day
later
again
!
My
spirit
began
to
revive
for
I
saw
a
change
in
my
son
his
face
was
different
and
one
could
look
into
his
eyes
he
did
not
turn
away
.
His
depression
was
still
there
,
but
the
despair
,
the
horror
had
gone
.
But
I
had
hardly
begun
to
be
more
hopeful
when
every-
thing
was
shattered
again
.
Yakov
became
like
a
wild
creature
again
,
there
was
no
going
near
him
.
He
sat
shut
up
all
day
in
his
room
and
went
no
more
to
the
colonel
's
widow
.
Had
he
offended
her
in
some
way
,
I
wondered
,
and
had
she
forbidden
him
the
house
?
But
no
,
I
thought
;
though
he
is
afflicted
he
would
not
venture
on
that
,
and
,
besides
,
she
is
not
that
sort
of
woman
.
I
could
not
refrain
from
ask-
ing
him
at
last
:
''
What
about
our
neighbour
,
Yakov
?
You
seem
to
have
quite
forgotten
her
.
''
And
he
positively
shouted
at
me
:
''
Our
neighbour
?
Do
you
want
him
to
laugh
at
me
?
''
``
What
?
''
I
said
.
But
he
clenched
his
fists
and
vras
quite
savage
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
he
used
only
to
stand
there
but
now
he
has
taken
to
laughing
and
grinning
!
Get
away
,
go
!
''
To
whom
he
addressed
those
words
,
I
don't
know
;
I
could
hardly
stagger
out
of
the
room
,
I
was
so
frightened
.
Only
imagine
;
his
face
was
as
red
as
copper
,
he
was
foaming
at
the
mouth
,
his
voice
was
hoarse
as
though
some-
one
was
suffocating
him
!
I
went
off
,
feeling
utterly
desolate
,
to
Mar
fa
Savvishna
that
very
day
...
I
found
her
in
great
distress
.
Her
very
appearance
was
changed
;
she
was
thinner
in
the
face
.
But
she
would
not
talk
to
me
about
my
son
.
She
only
said
one
thing
,
that
no
hu-
man
help
could
be
of
any
avail
.
``
You
must
pray
,
father
.
''
And
then
she
gave
me
a
hundred
roubles
for
the
poor
and
sick
of
my
parish
,
and
?
42
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
again
repeated
``
pray
.
''
My
God
,
as
though
I
did
not
pray
day
and
night
as
it
was
!
Father
Alexey
took
out
his
handkerchief
again
and
wiped
away
his
tears
,
this
time
openly
;
after
a
brief
pause
he
went
on
with
his
sad
story
.
After
that
we
went
from
bad
to
worse
,
Hke
a
snowball
rolling
down
hill
;
we
could
see
there
was
a
precipice
at
the
bottom
,
but
we
could
not
stop
ourselves
.
And
there
was
no
con-
cealing
it
;
there
was
great
commotion
in
the
whole
parish
because
the
priest
's
son
was
pos-
sessed
by
the
devil
.
People
said
that
the
au-
thorities
ought
to
be
informed
of
it
.
And
they
would
have
informed
them
,
no
doubt
,
but
my
parishioners
God
bless
them
for
it
were
sorry
for
me
.
Meanwhile
the
winter
was
over
and
spring
had
come
.
And
the
Lord
sent
us
such
a
beautiful
fine
spring
as
even
the
old
people
did
not
remember
:
the
sun
shone
all
day
,
it
was
warm
and
still
.
And
a
happy
thought
came
to
me
,
to
persuade
Yakov
to
go
with
me
on
a
pilgrimage
to
St.
Alitrofany
's
at
Voronezh
.
``
If
that
last
resource
is
of
no
avail
,
''
I
thought
,
''
then
the
only
hope
is
the
grave
.
''
Well
,
I
was
sitting
one
evening
on
the
steps
of
the
porch
;
there
was
a
glow
of
sunset
in
the
sky
,
the
larks
were
singing
,
the
apple
blos-
som
was
out
,
the
grass
was
green
.
...
I
sat
and
wondered
how
to
tell
Yakov
of
my
plan
.
All
at
once
I
saw
him
coming
out
on
to
the
steps
;
he
stood
and
looked
,
heaved
a
sigh
and
squatted
on
the
step
beside
me
.
I
was
quite
frightened
with
joy
but
I
did
not
say
a
word
.
And
he
sat
,
looked
at
the
sunset
and
was
silent
too
.
And
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
he
were
in
a
softened
mood
.
The
wrinkles
were
smoothed
on
his
forehead
,
even
his
eyes
were
clearer
...
it
looked
as
though
tears
were
almost
coming
into
them
.
Seeing
such
a
change
in
him
,
I
confess
I
grew
bolder
.
``
Yakov
,
''
I
said
,
``
hear
what
I
have
to
say
and
do
n't
be
angry
.
''
And
I
told
him
of
my
plan
of
how
we
should
go
on
foot
together
to
St.
Mitro-
fany
's
it
was
about
a
hundred
miles
from
us
to
Voronezh
and
how
pleasant
it
would
be
for
the
two
of
us
getting
up
before
the
sunrise
to
go
on
and
on
,
in
the
cool
of
the
spring
through
the
green
grass
in
the
high-road
;
and
I
told
him
that
if
we
fall
down
and
pray
at
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
the
shrine
of
the
saint
,
perhaps
who
knows
the
Lord
God
may
have
mercy
on
us
and
he
may
be
healed
,
of
which
there
have
been
many
examples
.
And
imagine
my
happiness
,
sir
!
``
Very
good
,
''
said
Yakov
,
and
he
did
turn
round
but
kept
looking
at
the
sky
.
``
I
agree
.
Let
us
go
.
''
I
was
overwhelmed
.
``
My
dear
,
''
I
said
,
``
my
darling
,
thank
you
!
''
He
asked
me
:
''
When
are
we
going
?
''
``
To-morrow
if
you
like
,
''
I
said
.
So
next
day
we
set
off
.
We
put
wallets
on
our
backs
,
took
staves
in
our
hands
and
started
.
We
walked
for
seven
whole
days
;
and
all
the
time
the
weather
was
propitious
.
It
was
won-
derful
!
There
was
no
rain
and
it
was
not
too
hot
;
the
flies
did
not
bite
us
and
the
dust
was
not
annoying
.
And
my
Yakov
looked
better
every
day
.
I
must
tell
you
that
in
the
open
air
Yakov
never
saw
him
but
he
felt
his
pres-
ence
behind
him
,
just
at
his
back
,
or
his
shadow
would
glide
by
him
,
which
troubled
my
son
very
much
.
But
this
time
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
;
and
at
the
inns
where
we
stayed
the
night
he
saw
nothing
either
.
We
did
not
talk
much
but
how
happy
we
were
,
especially
I
!
I
saw
my
poor
boy
coming
back
to
life
.
I
can
not
describe
,
sir
,
what
I
felt
then
.
Well
,
we
reached
Voronezh
at
last
.
We
washed
and
made
ourselves
clean
and
went
to
the
Ca-
thedral
,
to
the
shrine
of
the
saint
.
For
three
whole
days
we
scarcely
left
the
Cathedral
.
How
many
special
services
we
had
said
for
us
,
how
many
candles
we
set
up
!
and
all
went
smoothly
and
well
;
our
days
were
devout
,
our
nights
were
tranquil
;
my
Yasha
slept
like
a
baby
.
He
began
talking
to
me
of
his
own
accord
.
He
would
ask
me
,
``
Father
,
do
you
see
anything
?
''
while
he
smiled
.
``
I
see
nothing
,
''
I
would
re-
ply
.
``
Nor
I
either
,
''
he
would
say
.
What
more
could
I
desire
?
My
gratitude
to
the
saint
knew
no
bounds
.
Three
days
passed
,
and
I
said
to
Yakov
:
''
Well
,
now
,
my
boy
,
things
are
better
;
it
is
a
happy
day
for
us
.
There
is
only
one
thing
left
to
do
:
make
your
confession
,
and
take
the
sacrament
;
and
then
let
us
go
home
in
God's
name
and
after
a
good
rest
and
working
on
the
land
to
restore
your
strength
,
we
can
begin
to
look
about
us
and
find
a
post
or
something
.

Marfa

will
be
sure
to
help
us
in
that
.
''
``
No
,
''
said
Yakov
,
``
why
should
we
trouble
her
?
I
will
take
her
a
ring
from
St.
Mjtrof
any's
shrine
.
''
I
was
quite
carried
away
.
``
Mind
you
take
a
silver
and
not
a
gold
one
,
not
a
betrothal
ring
,
''
I
said
.
My
Yakov
flushed
and
only
repeated
``
We
must
not
trouble
her
,
''
but
he
agreed
to
every-
thing
at
once
.
We
went
next
day
to
the
Cathedral
;
my
Yakov
went
to
confession
and
how
earnestl
>
he
prayed
before
that
!
and
then
he
went
to
the
sacrament
.
I
stood
a
little
apart
and
could
hardly
feel
the
earth
tinder
my
feet
.
The
angels
in
heaven
are
not
happier
than
I
was
!
Only
I
looked
and
wondered
what
it
meant
:
my
Yakov
had
taken
the
sacrament
but
he
did
not
go
to
drink
the
wine
afterwards
!
He
stood
with
his
back
to
me
.
``
Yakov
,
''
I
said
to
him
,
``
why
are
you
stand-
ing
still
?
''
He
turned
round
sharply
;
and
would
you
be-
lieve
it
,
I
stepped
back
,
I
was
so
frightened
;
his
face
sometimes
looked
dreadful
but
now
it
had
become
savage
and
terrible
.
He
was
pale
as
death
,
his
hair
was
standing
on
end
,
his
eyes
were
squinting
.
.
.
my
voice
failed
me
from
terror
,
I
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
I
almost
swooned
.
And
he
simply
dashed
out
of
the
church
.
I
followed
him
...
he
went
straight
to
the
inn
where
we
had
slept
the
night
,
put
his
wallet
on
his
back
and
set
off
.
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
I
shouted
.
``
Yakov
,
what
is
the
matter
with
you
?
Stop
,
wait
!
''
But
not
a
word
did
Yakov
say
in
answer
,
he
ran
like
a
hare
and
it
was
impossible
to
overtake
him
.
He
vanished
.
I
turned
back
at
once
,
hired
a
cart
I
was
all
of
a
shake
and
could
say
nothing
but
Lord
,
Lord
!
And
I
did
not
understand
what
had
happened
to
us
.
I
made
my
way
home
,
for
I
felt
sure
that
he
had
gone
there
.
And
I
did
in
fact
come
upon
him
striding
along
the
high-road
,
four
miles
from
the
town
.
I
overtook
him
,
jumped
out
of
the
cart
and
ran
up
to
him
,
``
Yasha
!
Yasha
!
''
He
stopped
,
turned
round
facing
me
,
but
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
his
mouth
tightly
shut
.
And
whatever
I
said
to
him
he
stood
like
a
post
and
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
one
could
only
see
he
was
breathing
.
And
at
last
he
set
off
along
the
road
again
.
What
could
I
do
?
I
trudged
after
him
.
Oh
,
what
a
journey
that
was
,
sir
!
Our
re-
turn
was
as
awful
as
our
journey
to
Voronezh
had
been
joyful
.
If
I
began
talking
to
him
he
would
turn
round
and
snap
with
his
teeth
like
a
tiger
or
hyaena
.
I
do
not
know
how
it
was
I
did
not
go
out
of
my
mind
then
!
At
last
one
night
,
in
a
peasant
's
smoky
hut
he
sat
on
the
sleeping
shelf
,
dangling
his
legs
and
look-
ing
about
him
;
I
fell
on
my
knees
before
him
and
wept
and
bitterly
prayed
to
him
:
``
Don't
kill
your
old
father
outright
,
do
n't
drive
him
to
despair
tell
me
what
has
happened
to
you
!
''
He
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
though
till
then
he
had
looked
as
though
he
had
not
seen
who
was
before
him
and
all
at
once
he
began
to
speak
,
and
in
such
a
voice
that
it
is
ringing
in
my
ears
till
now
.
``
Listen
,
father
,
''
he
said
,
``
do
you
want
to
know
the
whole
truth
?
Here
it
is
for
you
.
When
I
took
the
sacrament
,
as
you
remember
,
and
while
the
consecrated
element
was
still
in
my
mouth
,
he
suddenly
stood
before
me
as
though
he
had
sprung
out
of
the
ground
(
in
the
church
,
in
full
daylight
!
)
and
whispered
in
my
ear
(
and
he
has
never
spoken
to
me
before
)
:
'Spit
it
out
and
stamp
on
it
!
'
I
did
so
I
spat
it
out
and
trod
on
it
.
And
so
now
I
am
lost
forever
,
for
every
crime
is
forgiven
but
not
the
sin
against
the
Holy
Ghost
.
''
And
uttering
these
awful
words
,
my
son
fell
on
the
shelf
while
I
sank
down
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
.
My
legs
gave
way
under
me
.
Father
Alexey
was
silent
for
an
instant
and
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
.
But
why
should
I
worry
you
and
myself
any
longer
(
he
went
on
)
.
My
son
and
I
dragged
ourselves
home
,
and
soon
after
that
his
end
came
and
I
lost
my
Yakov
.
For
some
days
before
his
death
he
neither
ate
nor
drank
he
kept
walking
up
and
down
the
room
repeating
that
his
sin
could
not
be
forgiven
.
.
.
but
he
did
not
see
him
any
more
.
``
He
has
ruined
my
soul
,
''
he
said
,
``
why
should
he
come
any
more
?
''
And
as
soon
as
Yakov
took
to
his
bed
he
sank
into
unconsciousness
,
and
so
,
without
penitence
,
like
a
senseless
worm
,
he
passed
from
this
life
into
eternity
.
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
But
I
do
n't
want
to
believe
that
the
Lord
will
pass
stern
judgment
on
him
,
.
.
And
one
reason
why
I
can
not
believe
it
is
that
he
looked
very
beautiful
lying
in
the
coffin
;
he
seemed
to
have
grown
quite
young
again
and
looked
like
my
Yakov
of
old
days
.
His
face
was
so
pure
and
gentle
,
his
hair
curled
in
ringlets
and
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
.
Marfa
Savvishna
came
to
look
at
him
she
said
the
same
.
She
put
flowers
all
round
him
and
she
put
flowers
on
his
heart
,
and
she
put
a
stone
on
his
grave
at
her
own
expense
.
And
I
was
left
alone
.
And
that
is
why
,
sir
,
you
have
detected
great
sorrow
in
my
face
.
It
will
never
pass
away
it
never
can
.
I
wanted
to
say
some
word
of
comfort
to
Father
Alexey
...
but
I
could
not
find
any-
thing
to
say
.
We
parted
soon
afterwards

There
was
nowhere
I
used
to
go
so
often
to
shoot
in
the
summer
as
to
the
village
of
Glin-
noye
,
which
was
fifteen
miles
from
my
own
estate
.
Perhaps
the
best
place
for
game
in
our
whole
district
was
near
that
village
.
After
going
through
all
the
surrounding
thickets
and
fields
,
towards
the
end
of
the
day
I
invariably
turned
into
a
marsh
close
by
,
the
only
one
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
from
there
went
back
to
my
hospitable
host
,
the
elder
of
the
village
,
with
whom
I
always
used
to
put
up
for
the
night
.
From
the
marsh
to
Glinnoye
it
is
not
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
.
The
road
runs
by
the
valley
,
except
that
halfway
one
has
to
climb
a
small
hill
.
On
the
top
of
that
hill
lies
a
homestead
consisting
of
a
small
,
uninhabited
manor-house
and
garden
.
It
almost
always
happened
to
me
to
pass
by
it
in
the
full
glow
of
the
sunset
and
I
remember
that
this
house
with
its
nailed-up
windows
reminded
me
of
a
blind
old
man
who
has
come
out
to
warm
him-
self
in
the
sun
.
He
sits
,
poor
dear
,
close
to
the
road
.
The
light
of
the
sun
has
long
ago
passed
into
unchanging
darkness
for
him
but
he
feels
it
on
his
raised
and
outstretched
face
and
on
his
warmed
cheeks
.
It
seemed
as
though
no
one
had
lived
in
the
house
itself
for
years
;
but
in
the
tiny
lodge
in
the
garden
there
was
a
decrepit
house-serf
who
had
received
his
freedom
,
a
tall
,
stooping
,
grey-headed
old
man
with
an
expressive
and
immobile
face
He
was
always
sitting
on
a
little
bench
in
front
of
the
one
little
window
in
the
lodge
,
looking
with
mournful
dreaminess
into
the
distance
,
and
on
seeing
me
he
would
rise
a
little
from
his
seat
and
bow
with
the
deliberate
dignity
that
dis-
tinguishes

eration
not
of
our
fathers
,
but
of
our
grand-
fathers
.
I
used
to
speak
to
him
but
he
was
not
fond
of
talking
:
all
I
learned
from
him
was
that
the
place
on
which
he
was
living
belonged
to
the
granddaughter
of
his
old
master
,
a
widow
who
had
a
younger
sister
;
that
they
both
lived
in
towns
beyond
the
sea
and
that
they
never
showed
themselves
at
home
;
that
he
himself
would
like
to
end
his
days
as
soon
as
might
be
because
``
one
goes
on
munching
bread
till
one
is
weary
;
one
has
been
doing
it
so
long
.
''
The
old
man
's
name
was
Lukyanitch
.
One
day
I
somehow
lingered
late
in
the
fields
;
I
had
come
upon
a
good
deal
of
game
,
and
it
was
a
good
day
for
shooting
from
early
morning
still
and
grey
as
though
full
of
the
feeling
of
evening
.
I
wandered
far
,
and
it
was
not
merely
getting
dusk
but
the
moon
had
risen
,
and
night
,
as
the
saying
is
,
had
long
hung
over
the
sky
,
when
I
reached
the
familiar
house
.
I
had
to
walk
along
beside
the
fence
of
the
garden
.
.
.
.
There
was
perfect
stillness
all
around
.
.
.
.
``
^
crossed
the
high-road
,
cautiously
made
my
way
through
the
dusty
nettles
and
leaned
against
the
low
hurdle
.
The
little
garden
all
fragrant
and
dewy
lay
perfectly
still
before
me
,
all
lighted
up
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
soothed
to
rest
by
the
silver
rays
of
the
moon
;
laid
out
in
the
old-fashioned
style
,
it
consisted
of
one
oblong
plot
.
Little
straight
paths
met
at
a
round
flower-bed
in
the
very
centre
,
thickly
over-
grown
with
asters
.
It
was
surrounded
by
an
even
border
of
tall
lime-trees
except
at
one
part
where
through
an
opening
about
fourteen
feet
wide
between
the
trees
I
saw
the
low-
pitched
house
with
,
to
my
surprise
,
two
win-
dows
lighted
up
.
Young
apple-trees
rose
here
and
there
above
the
lawn
;
the
soft
blue
of
the
night
sky
showed
through
their
slender
branches
bathed
in
the
slumbering
moonlight
;
before
each
apple-tree
its
faint
chequered
shadow
lay
on
the
silvery
grass
.
On
one
side
of
the
garden
the
lime-trees
,
flooded
with
pale
,
vivid
,
motionless
light
,
were
a
blur
of
dull
green
;
on
the
other
side
they
stood
all
black
and
opaque
;
a
strange
,
suppressed
rustle
arose
from
time
to
time
in
their
thick
foliage
;
they
seemed
to
be
THREE
MEETINGS
calling
one
to
the
paths
beneath
them
,
to
be
beckoning
one
to
their
dark
canopy
.
The
whole
sky
was
spangled
with
stars
;
their
soft
blue
radiance
flowed
mysteriously
from
on
high
;
they
seemed
gazing
with
gentle
attention
at
the
far-away
earth
.
Little
,
delicate
clouds
floated
now
and
again
across
the
moon
and
for
an
instant
changed
its
peaceful
light
to
a
vague
but
luminous
mist
.
.
.
.
Everything
was
slumbering
.
The
air
,
warm
and
fragrant
,
did
not
stir
;
only
from
time
to
time
it
quivered
as
water
quivers
at
the
fall
of
a
twig
.
There
was
a
feeling
of
languor
,
of
yearning
in
it
.
.
.
.
I
bent
over
the
fence
;
a
red
field
poppy
lifted
its
straight
stalk
above
the
rank
grass
before
me
,
and
a
great
round
drop
of
night
dew
glit-
tered
with
a
dark
light
in
its
open
cup
.
Every-
thing
was
slumbering
,
everything
lay
luxuri-
ously
and
seemed
to
be
gazing
upwards
,
waiting
without
stirring
.
.
.
.
What
was
this
warm
,
not
yet
sleeping
night
awaiting
?
-^
It
was
waiting
for
a
sound
;
a
living
voice
was
what
that
listening
silence
awaited
but
all
was
still
.
The
nightingales
had
long
ceased
singing
,
and
the
sudden
hum
of
a
beetle
flying
by
,
the
faint
splash
of
a
tiny
fish
in
the
pool
at
the
end
of
the
garden
beyond
the
lime-trees
,
the
drowsy
note
of
a
startled
bird
,
the
far-away
cry
in
the
fields
,
so
far
away
that
the
ear
could
not
distinguish
whether
it
was
the
cry
of
a
man
,
a
beast
or
a
bird
,
the
short
,
quick
thud
of
hoofs
upon
the
road
all
these
faint
sounds
,
these
rustles
,
only
deepened
the
stillness
.
.
.
.
My
heart
yearned
with
an
indescribable
feel-
ing
that
was
akin
to
the
expectation
or
memory
of
happiness
;
I
dared
not
stir
,
I
stood
motion-
less
before
the
motionless
garden
,
bathed
in
moonlight
and
dew
,
and
,
I
do
not
know
why
,
gazed
fixedly
at
those
two
windows
dimly
red
in
the
soft
half
shadow
,
when
suddenly
a
chord
rang
out
in
the
house
,
it
rang
out
and
rolled
away
hke
a
wave
.
.
.
.
The
sensitively
reso-
nant
air
responded
with
an
echo
...
I
could
not
help
starting
.
A
woman
's
voice
rang
out
after
the
chord
.
...
I
began
listening
greedily
and
.
.
.
can
I
express
my
amazement
?
.
.
.
two
years
be-
fore
in
Italy
at
Sorrento
I
had
heard
the
same
song
,
the
same
voice
.
.
.
yes
,
yes

THREE
MEETINGS
It
was
the
same
,
I
knew
those
strains
.
.
.
.
It
had
happened
hke
this
:
I
was
returning
home
after
a
long
walk
on
the
sea-shore
.
I
was
walking
rapidly
along
the
street
;
night
had
fallen
the
magnificent
night
of
the
South
,
not
still
and
mournfully
pensive
like
ours
,
no
!
all
bright
,
luxurious
and
lovely
as
a
happy
woman
in
the
flower
of
her
youth
;
the
moon
shone
with
incredible
brilliance
,
the
glittering
stars
seemed
quivering
in
the
dark-blue
sky
,
the
black
shadows
stood
out
sharply
against
the
earth
that
looked
almost
yellow
in
the
bright
light
.
On
both
sides
of
the
street
stretched
the
stone
walls
of
the
gardens
,
orange-trees
lifted
their
crooked
branches
above
them
,
the
golden
globes
of
the
heavy
fruit
could
just
be
seen
hidden
among
the
tangled
leaves
,
or
stood
out
vividly
,
displayed
in
all
their
richness
by
the
moon
.
On
many
of
the
trees
there
was
still
the
tender
whiteness
of
the
flowers
;
the
air
was
saturated
with
languorous
fragrance
,
powerful
,
poignant
and
almost
oppressive
,
yet
indescribably
sweet
.
I
walked
along
and
I
must
confess
I
had
grown
so
used
to
all
these
marvels
that
I
thought
i6i
of
nothing
but
getting
quickly
home
to
my
hotel
,
when
all
at
once
from
a
little
pavilion
built
right
upon
the
wall
beside
which
I
was
hurrying
there
came
the
sound
of
a
woman's
voice
.
It
was
singing
a
song
I
did
not
know
,
and
in
its
sound
there
was
a
note
of
such
eager
summons
,
it
seemed
so
full
of
the
passionate
and
joyful
expectation
expressed
in
the
words
of
the
song
that
I
could
not
help
stopping
short
at
once
and
raising
my
head
.
There
were
two
windows
in
the
pavihon
but
the
blinds
were
down
in
both
and
only
a
pale
light
filtered
through
their
narrow
chinks
.
After
repeating
twice
``
vieni
,
vieni
''
the
voice
died
away
.
I
heard
the
faint
twang
of
strings
,
as
though
of
a
guitar
falling
on
the
carpet
,
there
was
a
light
rustle
of
skirts
,
a
faint
creak
of
the
floor
.
The
streaks
of
light
vanished
from
one
win-
dow
.
.
.
.
Someone
from
within
came
up
to
it
and
leaned
over
it
.
I
stepped
back
two
paces
.
All
at
once
the
blinds
rattled
and
were
thrust
back
;
a
graceful
woman
dressed
all
in
white
rapidly
thrust
her
charming
head
out
of
the
window
and
,
stretching
out
her
arms
to
me
,
said
:
''
Sei
tu
?
''
I
was
taken
aback
,
I
did
not
know
THREE
MEETINGS
what
to
say
,
but
at
the
same
instant
the
un-
known
lady
darted
back
with
a
faint
cry
,
the
blind
was
dropped
and
the
light
in
the
pavilion
grew
even
dimmer
,
as
though
it
had
been
car-
ried
off
into
another
room
.
I
stood
motion-
less
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
I
came
to
myself
.
The
face
of
the
woman
who
had
so
suddenly
appeared
before
me
was
strikingly
beautiful
.
I
had
caught
too
hurried
a
glimpse
of
it
to
be
able
to
recall
at
once
each
separate
feature
,
but
the
general
impression
was
un-
utterably
vivid
and
deep
.
...
I
felt
at
that
time
that
I
should
not
forget
that
face
all
my
life
.
The
moonlight
fell
straight
upon
the
wall
of
the
pavilion
,
on
the
window
at
which
she
had
shown
herself
and
,
my
God
!
how
magnificently
her
great
dark
eyes
had
shone
in
its
radiance
,
what
a
heavy
wave
of
half
loose
,
black
hair
fell
on
the
curve
of
her
lifted
,
shapely
shoulder
!
What
wealth
of
shy
,
luxurious
softness
in
the
soft
bending
of
her
waist
,
what
a
caress
in
her
voice
when
she
called
me
in
that
hurried
but
resonant
whisper
!
_
After
standing
for
some
time
on
the
same
spot
I
walked
a
little
aside
.163
in
the
shadow
of
the
opposite
wall
and
fell
to
gazing
at
the
pavilion
with
a
sort
of
stupid
bewilderment
and
expectation
.
I
listened
.
.
.
listened
with
strained
attention
.
,
.
I
fan-
cied
now
someone
softly
breathing
at
the
dark-
ened
window
,
now
a
rustle
and
a
soft
laugh
.
At
last
there
came
the
sound
of
far-away
foot-
steps
.
.
.
they
came
closer
;
a
man
of
about
the
same
height
as
myself
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
went
hurriedly
up
to
a
little
gate
,
which
I
had
not
noticed
before
,
close
to
the
pavilion
,
without
looking
round
,
knocked
twice
with
the
iron
ring
,
waited
a
little
,
knocked
again
,
and
sang
in
an
undertone
,
``
Ecco
ri~
dente
.
.
.
.
''
The
gate
was
opened
...
he
noiselessly
glided
in
.
I
started
,
shook
my
head
,
and
with
a
gesture
of
perplexity
morosely
pulled
my
hat
over
my
eyes
and
discontentedly
set
off
home
.
Next
day
quite
fruitlessly
and
in
the
very
heat
of
the
day
I
walked
for
two
hours
up
and
down
the
street
by
the
pavilion
and
that
evening
I
left
Sorrento
without
hay-
ing
visited
Tasso
's
house
.
The
reader
may
well
imagine
the
amazement
with
which
I
was
instantly
overcome
when
I
^
164
THREE
MEETINGS
heard
the
same
voice
,
the
same
song
in
the
steppe
,
in
one
of
the
remotest
parts
of
Rus-
sia
,
...
As
then
it
was
night
;
as
then
the
voice
rang
out
from
a
Hghted
,
unknown
room
;
as
then
I
was
alone
.
My
heart
beat
violently
.
``
Is
n't
it
a
dream
?
''
I
thought
.
And
then
I
heard
again
the
last
``
Vieni
.
.
.
.
''
Would
the
window
open
?
Would
the
woman
show
her-
self
?
The
window
was
opened
.
At
the
win-
dow
a
woman
appeared
.
I
recognised
her
at
once
though
there
was
the
distance
of
fifty
paces
between
us
,
though
a
light
cloud
veiled
the
moon
.
It
was
she
,
my
unknown
lady
of
Sorrento
.
But
she
did
not
as
before
stretch
her
bare
arms
out
of
the
window
;
she
softly
folded
them
and
,
leaning
them
on
the
window-sill
,
fell
to
gazing
into
i^^e
garden
silently
,
without
mov-
ing
.
Yes
,
it
was
she
;
those
were
her
features
which
I
could
never
forget
,
those
were
the
eyes
of
which
I
had
never
seen
the
like
.
As
before
,
a
full
white
dress
enfolded
her
limbs
.
She
looked
a
little
plumper
than
at
Sorrento
.
Every-
thing
about
her
was
fragrant
of
the
confidence
and
repose
of
love
,
of
the
triumph
of
beauty
,
soothed
by
happiness
.
For
a
long
while
she
did
not
stir
,
then
looked
back
into
the
room
and
sud-
denly
drawing
herself
up
exclaimed
three
times
in
a
loud
and
ringing
voice
:
``
Addiol
''
The
lovely
sounds
floated
far
,
far
away
,
and
for
a
long
time
their
vibrations
lingered
,
growing
fainter
and
dying
away
above
the
lime-trees
in
the
garden
and
in
the
fields
behind
me
and
in
all
directions
.
For
some
moments
all
the
coun-
try
round
me
was
full
of
that
woman
's
voice
,
everything
was
ringing
in
response
to
it
was
ringing
with
it
.
She
closed
the
window
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
light
in
the
house
was
put
out
.
As
soon
as
I
recovered
myself
which
I
con-
fess
was
not
very
quickly
I
walked
at
once
beside
the
garden
towards
the
lodge
,
went
up
to
the
closed
gates
and
looked
over
the
fence
.
Nothing
exceptional
could
be
seen
in
the
yard
;
a
carriage
was
standing
in
the
corner
under
a
shed
.
The
fore
part
of
it
,
bespattered
with
dry
mud
,
looked
white
in
the
moonlight
.
The
shut-
ters
in
the
house
were
closed
as
before
.
I
for-
got
to
say
I
had
not
visited
Glinnoye
for
about
a
week
.
For
over
half
an
hour
I
walked
up
and
down
before
the
fence
in
perplexity
,
so
l66
THREE
MEETINGS
that
at
last
I
attracted
the
attention
of
the
old
house-dog
;
he
did
not
bark
,
however
,
but
only
looked
at
me
from
his
seat
under
the
gate
with
extraordinary
irony
in
his
screwed-up
,
purblind
eyes
.
I
understood
his
hint
and
made
off
.
But
I
riad
not
gone
half
a
mile
before
I
heard
the
clatter
of
horses
'
hoofs
behind
me
.
.
.
a
few
moments
later
a
man
on
a
black
horse
dashed
by
me
at
a
quick
trot
.
Rapidly
turn-
ing
his
face
towards
me
,
so
that
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
eagle
nose
and
handsome
mous-
tache
under
a
cap
pulled
forward
on
his
fore*
head
,
he
took
the
road
to
the
right
and
imme-
diately
vanished
behind
the
copse
.
``
So
that
is
he
,
''
I
thought
and
my
heart
was
strangely
stirred
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
recog-
nised
him
;
his
figure
certainly
reminded
me
of
the
man
whom
I
had
seen
go
in
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
in
Sorrento
.
Half
an
hour
later
I
was
at
Glinnoye
,
at
the
elder
's
.
I
woke
him
up
and
at
once
began
asking
him
who
had
come
to
that
house
.
He
answered
me
with
an
effort
that
the
ladies
M'ho
owned
it
had
arrived
.
``
What
ladies
?
''
I
asked
impatiently
.
``
Why
,
the
ladies
,
to
be
sure
,
''
he
answered
very
listlessly
.
``
But
what
sort
of
ladies
?
''
``
Why
,
like
any
ladies
,
to
be
sure
.
''
``
Russian
?
''
``
Why
,
what
else
should
they
be
?
Russian
to
be
sure
.
''
``
Not
foreigners
?
''
``
Eh
?
''
``
Is
it
long
since
they
arrived
?

''
That
I
could
n't
say
.
''
``
Are
they
rich
?
''
``
That
we
ca
n't
tell
.
Maybe
they
are

''
``
Did
not
some
gentleman
come
with
them
?
''
``
A
gentleman
?
''
``
Yes
,
a
gentleman
.
''
The
elder
heaved
a
sigh
.
``
Oh
,
Lord
!
''
he
brought
out
,
yawning
.
.
.
.
``
No-oo
,
no

...
no

,
I
think
.

he
added
suddenly
.
``

there

ing

``

heaved
a
sigh
again
.

he
muttered
.
``

``

``

The

was
silent
for
a
space
.
``

.

ca
n't
say

''
``
There
,

are

I
exclaimed
with
vexation
.
Knowing
by
experience
that
when
a
Russian
takes
to
answering
in
that
way
there
is
no
possibility
of
getting
anything

out
of
him
(
moreover
my
host
had
only
just
Iain
down
to
sleep
and
at
every
answer
he
gave
a
faint
lurch
forward
,
opening
his
eyes
wide
with
babyish
wonder
,
and
with
difficulty
part-
ing
his
lips
smeared
with
the
honey
of
the

)
,
I
made
a
gesture
of
despair
and
,
refusing
supper
,
went
to
the
bam

?
For
a
long
time
I
could
not
sleep
.
``
What
is
she
?
''
I
was
continually
asking
myself
.
``
A

If
she
is
Russian
why
does
she
speak

happened

''
Excited
by
these
confused
and
disconnected
thoughts
,
I
fell
asleep
late
and
had
strange
dreams
.
...
At
one
moment
I
fancied
I
was
wandering
somewhere
in
the
wilderness
in
the
very
heat
of
mid-day
and
suddenly
I
saw
before
me
,
racing
over
the
baked
yellow
sand
,
a
great
patch
of
shadow
.
...
I
raised
my
head
she
,
my
beautiful
lady
,
was
floating
THREE
MEETINGS
through
the
air
,
all
white
with
long
white
wings
and
beckoning
me
to
her
.
I
rushed
after
her
;
but
she
floated
lightly
and
rapidly
and
I
could
not
rise
up
from
the
earth
and
stretched
out
eager
arms
in
vain
.
*'Addio
!
''
she
said
to
me
,
flying
away
.
``
Why
have
you
no
wing3
?
Addio
!
''
and
then
from
all
sides
I
heard
''
Addio
,
''
every
grain
of
sand
was
shouting
and
shrieking
to
me
*
'
Addio'*

.
.
That
i
rang
out
in
an
insufferable
sharp
trill
.
...
I
waved
it
away
like
a
gnat
.
I
looked
for
her
.
.
.
but
she
had
already
become
a
little
cloud
and
waf
softly
mounting
to
the
sun
;
the
sun
quivered
,
trembled
,
laughed
,
stretched
out
long
golden
threads
to
meet
her
,
and
now
she
was
tangled
in
those
threads
and
melting
into
them
,
while
I
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
like
one
pos-
sessed
:
``
It
's
not
the
sun
,
it
's
not
the
sun
,
it's
that
Italian
spider
;
who
gave
him
a
passport
to
Russia
?
I
will
expose
him
:
I
saw
him
steal-
ing
oranges
in
other
people
's
gardens
.
.
.
.
''
Then
I
dreamed
I
was
walking
along
a
nar-
row
mountain
path
...
I
was
hurrying
;
I
had
to
get
somewhere
in
haste
,
some
unheard-
of
happiness
was
awaiting
me
;
all
at
once
a
huge
cliff
rose
up
before
me
;
I
looked
for
a
path
;
I
went
to
the
right
,
I
went
to
the
left
there
was
no
way
to
pass
!
And
suddenly
be-
yond
the
rock
a
voice
rang
out
:
``
Passa
,
passa
que
'
colli
.
.
.
.
''
It
was
calling
me
,
that
voice
;
it
repeated
its
mournful
summons
.
I
rushed
about
in
my
misery
seeking
for
the
smallest
crevice
.
.
.
.
Alas
!
It
was
an
overhanging
wall
,
granite
on
all
sides
.
.
.
.
``
Passa
que'
colli
``
the
voice
repeated
plaintively
.
My
heart
ached
,
I
flung
myself
against
the
smooth
stone
,
in
my
frenzy
I
tore
it
with
my
nails
.
A
dark
passage
suddenly
opened
before
me
.
.
.
.
Faint
with
joy
I
struggled
forward
.
.
.
.
``
Nonsense
,
''
someone
shouted
to
me
;
``
You
shall
not
pass
.
...
''
I
looked
up
:
Lukyanitch
was
standing
before
me
,
waving
his
arms
and
threatening
me
.
I
hurriedly
fumbled
in
my
pockets
:
I
meant
to
bribe
him
;
but
I
could
find
nothing
in
my
pockets
.
.
.
.
``
Lukyanitch
,
''
I
said
to
him
,
``
Lukyanitch
,
let
me
pass
;
I
will
reward
you
afterwards
.
''
``
You
are
mistaken
,
Signor
,
''
Lukyanitch
an-
swered
,
and
his
face
assumed
a
strange
expres-
sion
.
``
I
am
not
a
servant
;
recognise
in
me
THREE

Don
Quixote
De
La
Mancha
,
the
famous
knight-errant
;
I
have
been
all
my
life

my
Dulcinea
and
could
not
find
her
,
and
I
can-
not
endure
that
you
should
find
yours
.
.
.
.
''
``
Passa

'

.
.
.
''
the
voice
,
almost
sob-
bing
,
rings
out
again
.
``
Stand
aside
,
Signor
!
''
I
cried
with
fury
,
and
was
on
the
point
of
dashing
forward
,
but
the
knight
's
long
lance
struck
me
to
the
heart
...
I
fell
like
one
dead
...
I
lay
on
my
back
.
...
I
could
not
stir
.
.
.
and
behold
,
I
saw
her
coming
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
gracefully
holding
it
above
her
head
.
Looking
about
her
in
the
dark-
ness
and
cautiously
stealing
up
,
she
bent
down
over
me
.
.
.
.
``
So
this
is
he
,
that
fool
.
He
tried
to
find
out
who
I
am
,
''
she
said
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
,
and
the
burning
oil
of
her
lamp
dropped
straight
on
my
wounded
heart
.
.
.
.
``
Psyche
!
''
I
cried
with
an
effort
,
and
woke
up
.
.
.
.
I
slept
badly
all
night
and
was
on
my
feet
before
it
was
light
.
Hurriedly
dressing
and
taking
my
gun
,
I
set
off
at
once
for
the
house
.
My
impatience
was
so
great
that
the
sunrise
was
only
beginning
by
the
time
I
reached
the
m
familiar
gates
.
The
larks
were
singing
all
around
,
jackdaws
were
cawing
on
the
birch-
trees
;
but
in
the
house
everything
was
sleeping
the
deep
sleep
of
morning
.
Even
the
dog
was
snoring
behind
the
fence
.
In
an
agony
of
ex-
pectation
,
strained
almost
to
anger
,
I
walked
up
and
down
the
dewy
grass
,
looking
incessantly
at
the
low-pitched
and
ugly
little
house
which
sheltered
this
enigmatic
creature
within
its
walls
.
All
at
once
the
little
gate
gave
a
faint
creak
and
opened
,
and
Lukyanitch
appeared
in
the
gateway
,
wearing
a
kind
of
striped
Cossack
coat
.
His
face
with
its
ruffled
hair
seemed
to
me
more
morose
than
ever
.
Looking
at
me
not
without
some
amazement
,
he
was
about
to
shut
the
gate
again
.
``
My
good
man
,
my
good
man
!
''
I
cried
out
hurriedly
.
``
What
do
you
want
at
such
an
early
hour
?
''
he
replied
slowly
in
a
hollow
voice
.
``
Tell
me
,
please
,
your
mistress
has
come
,
I
am
told
?
''
Lukyanitch
was
silent
for
a
moment
.
``
Yes
,
she
has
come
.
.
.
.
''
``
Alone
?
''

THREE
MEETINGS
''
With
her

''
``
Had
n't
they
visitors
yesterday
?
''
``
No
.
''
And
he
pulled
the
gate
towards
him
.
``
Stay
,
stay
,
my
good
man
...
do
me
the
favour
.
.
.
''
Lukyanitch
coughed
and
shrank
together
from
the
cold
.
``
Why
,
what
is
it
you
want
?
''
``
Tell
me
,
please
,
how
old
is
your
mistress
?
''
Lukyanitch
glanced
at
me
suspiciously
.
``
How
old
is
my
mistress
?
I
do
n't
know
.
Over
forty
she
must
be
.
''
``
Over
forty
!
And
how
old
is
her
sister
?
''
``
Why
,
she
's
about
forty
.
''
``
Impossible
!
And
is
she
good-looking
?
''
``
Who
?
the
sister
?
''
``
Yes
,
the
sister
.
''
Lukyanitch
gave
a
laugh
.
``
I
do
n't
know
;
that
is
as
one
fancies
;
to
my
thinking
,
she
is
not
.
''
``
How
so
?
''
``
Oh
,
she
's
not
much
to
boast
of
.
Rather
weakly
looking
.
''
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
And
has
no
one
else
come
?
''
^7^
''
No
one
.
Who
should
come
?
''
``
But
that
can
not
be
.
I
.
.
.
''
``
Eh
,
sir
,
we
shall
never
have
done
talking
,
''
the
old
man
answered
with
vexation
.
``
It
's
so
cold
!
Pray
excuse
me
.
''
``
Stay
,
stay
.
.
.
here
's
.
.
.
''
and
I
held
out
a
quarter
rouble
I
had
got
ready
beforehand
but
my
hand
knocked
against
the
rapidly
slammed
gate
.
The
silver
coin
fell
on
the
earth
,
rolled
away
and
lay
at
my
feet
.
``
Ah
,
the
old
rogue
,
''
I
thought
;
``
Don
Quixote
De
La
Mancha
,
you
have
been
told
to
hold
your
tongue
,
it
seems
.
.
.
but
wait
a
bit
,
you
won't
get
rid
of
me
so
easily
.
.
.
.
''
I
vowed
to
myself
that
come
what
may
I
would
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
.
For
about
half
an
hour
I
walked
up
and
down
,
not
knowing
what
course
to
decide
upon
.
At
last
I
made
up
my
mind
first
to
find
out
in
the
village
who
had
arrived
at
the
place
and
whose
it
was
,
then
to
come
back
again
and
,
as
the
saying
is
,
not
to
give
it
up
till
the
mystery
was
explained
.
My
unknown
lady
would
come
out
into
the
garden
,
I
should
see
her
at
last
by
daylight
,
from
close
by
,
as
a
living
woman
,
not
as
an
THREE
MEETINGS
apparition
.
The
village
was
less
than
a
mile
away
and
I
set
off
at
once
in
that
direction
,
stepping
out
lightly
and
confidently
.
A
strange
defiance
was
rising
and
working
in
my
blood
;
the
invigorating
freshness
of
morning
strung
me
up
after
my
restless
night
.
In
the
village
I
learned
all
that
was
to
be
learned
from
two
peasants
on
their
way
to
work
;
that
is
,
that
the
place
together
with
the
village
I
had
reached
was
called
Mihailovskoye
,
that
it
belonged
to
the
widow
of
a
major
,
a
lady
called
Anna
Fyodorovna
Shlykov
,
that
she
had
an
unmarried
sister
called
Pelageya
Fyo-
dorovna
Badayev
,
that
they
were
both
getting
on
in
years
and
were
wealthy
,
that
they
scarcely
ever
stayed
at
home
but
were
always
travelling
about
,
that
they
kept
no
servants
but
two
maids
and
a
man
cook
,
that
Anna
Fyodorovna
had
arrived
a
few
days
before
from
Moscow
ac-
companied
by
no
one
but
her
sister
.
This
last
circumstance
disconcerted
me
greatly
;
I
could
not
suppose
that
the
peasants
,
too
,
had
orders
to
say
nothing
about
my
unknown
lady
.
But
to
admit
that
Anna
Fyodorovna
Shlykov
,
a
wido\y
of
five
and
forty
,
and
the
charming
^71
young
woman
I
had
seen
the
night
before
were
the
same
person
was
impossible
.
Pelageya
Fyodorovna
was
,
according
to
the
description
of
her
,
not
distinguished
by
beauty
either
,
and
,
besides
,
at
the
very
thought
that
the
woman
I
had
seen
in
Sorrento
could
be
called
Pelageya
and
,
worse
still
,
Badayev
,
I
shrugged
my
shoul-
ders
and
laughed
angrily
.
And
yet
I
had
seen
her
yesterday
in
that
house
.
.
.
seen
her
,
seen
her
with
my
own
eyes
,
I
thought
.
Thor-
oughly
vexed
,
roused
to
fury
,
but
still
more
persistent
in
my
intention
,
I
was
on
the
point
of
going
back
to
the
garden
.
.
.
but
I
glanced
at
my
watch
:
it
was
not
yet
six
o'clock
.
I
made
up
my
mind
to
wait
a
little
.
At
the
house
everyone
was
most
likely
still
asleep
.
.
.
.
And
to
hang
about
it
at
such
an
hour
would
only
have
been
exciting
suspicion
for
nothing
;
moreover
,
there
was
a
stretch
of
bushes
before
me
and
beyond
them
I
could
see
a
copse
of
aspen-trees
.
...
I
must
do
myself
the
jus-
tice
to
say
that
in
spite
of
the
thoughts
that
were
exciting
me
the
noble
passion
for
the
chase
was
not
utterly
eclipsed
,
``
Maybe
,
''
I
thought
,
``
I
shall
come
upon
a
covey
,
and
the
>
Z8
THREE
MEETINGS
time
will
pass
.
''
I
went
into
the
thicket
.
But
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
walked
very
carelessly
ancj
paid
Uttle
attention
to
the
rules
of
the
art
:
I
did
not
keep
a
constant
watch
on
my
dog
,
I
did
not
``
snort
''
over
a
thick
bush
in
the
hope
that
a
red-crested
blackcock
would
fly
up
from
it
with
a
clatter
and
outcry
,
and
I
kept
looking
at
my
watch
,
which
was
utterly
out
of
place
.
At
last
it
was
getting
on
for
nine
.
``
It
's
time
,
''
I
cried
aloud
,
and
was
just
turning
back
to-
wards
the
house
when
a
huge
blackcock
really
was
startled
out
of
the
thick
grass
two
paces
from
me
;
I
fired
at
the
magnificent
bird
and
wounded
it
under
the
wing
.
It
almost
rolled
over
but
righted
itself
,
made
for
the
copse
,
quivering
its
wings
and
diving
,
tried
to
rise
above
the
first
aspen-trees
but
,
growing
weak
,
fell
all
of
a
heap
into
a
thicket
.
To
abandon
such
game
would
have
been
utterly
unpardon-
able
;
I
promptly
went
after
it
,
entered
the
copse
,
made
a
signal
to
Dianka
,
and
a
few
mo-
ments
later
heard
a
feeble
rustling
and
clat-
tering
;
it
was
the
unhappy
blackcock
struggling
under
the
paws
of
my
quick-scented
dog
.
I
picked
it
up
,
put
it
in
my
gamebag
,
looked
round
and
stood
still
as
though
rivetted
to
the
spot
.
.
.
.
The
copse
into
which
I
had
gone
was
very
thick
and
overgrown
so
that
I
had
difficulty
in
getting
to
the
spot
where
the
bird
had
fallen
;
but
at
a
short
distance
from
me
there
was
a
winding
cart-road
and
along
that
road
my
beautiful
lady
was
riding
on
horseback
at
a
walking
pace
and
beside
her
the
man
who
had
overtaken
me
the
evening
before
;
I
recog-
nised
him
by
his
moustaches
.
They
were
rid-
ing
slowly
in
silence
,
holding
each
other's
hands
;
their
horses
seemed
scarcely
moving
,
languidly
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
grace-
fully
craning
their
long
necks
.
Recovering
from
my
first
terror
.
.
.
yes
,
terror
I
can
give
no
other
name
to
the
feeling
which
sud-
denly
overwhelmed
me
I
simply
fastened
my
eyes
on
her
.
How
lovely
she
was
!
How
en-
chantingly
her
graceful
form
moved
to
meet
me
in
the
midst
of
the
emerald
greenery
!
Soft
shadows
,
delicate
reflections
slowly
glided
over
her
over
her
long
grey
dress
,
over
her
slen-
der
,
slightly
bowed
neck
,
over
her
pale
rosy
face
,
over
her
glossy
black
hair
which
sprang
.180
THREE
MEETINGS
out
in
luxuriant
abundance
from
under
her
low
hat
.
But
how
can
I
describe
the
expression
of
the
perfect
,
passionate
mutely
passionate
bliss
with
which
her
features
were
breathing
!
Her
head
seemed
as
though
bent
under
the
weight
of
it
;
moist
gleams
of
gold
shone
out
of
her
dark
eyes
,
half
hidden
by
their
lashes
;
they
looked
nowhere
,
those
happy
eyes
,
and
the
deli-
cate
brows
were
lowered
over
them
.
A
vague
,
childlike
smile
the
smile
of
deep
joy
was
straying
on
her
lips
;
it
seemed
as
though
ex-
cess
of
happiness
was
exhausting
and
as
it
were
breaking
her
down
a
little
,
just
as
the
fully
opened
flower
sometimes
breaks
down
its
stalk
;
both
her
hands
lay
limp
:
one
in
the
hand
of
the
man
riding
beside
her
,
the
other
on
the
horse
's
forelock
.
I
had
time
to
look
at
her
thoroughly
and
at
him
also
.
.
.
.
He
was
a
handsome
,
imposing-looking
man
with
a
for-
eign
face
.
He
was
looking
at
her
boldly
and
gaily
and
,
as
far
as
I
could
judge
,
admiring
her
with
secret
pride
.
He
was
admiring
her
,
the
villain
,
and
was
very
well
pleased
with
him-
self
and
not
sufficiently
moved
,
not
melted
with
gratitude
yes
,
that
was
what
was
lacking
.
i8i
.
.
.
And
,
indeed
,
no
man
deserves
such
devo-
tion
^What
soul
,
even
the
noblest
,
is
worthy
of
inspiring
such
happiness
in
another
soul
?
...
I
must
confess
I
envied
him
.
.
.
.
Mean-
while
they
both
were
on
a
level
with
me
.
.
.
.
My
dog
suddenly
jumped
out
on
the
road
and
barked
.
My
unknown
lady
started
,
looked
hur-
riedly
round
,
and
,
seeing
me
,
switched
her
horse
on
the
neck
with
the
riding
whip
.
The
horse
gave
a
snort
,
reared
and
set
off
at
a
gallop
.
.
.
.
The
man
at
once
spurred
his
raven
horse
and
when
a
few
minutes
later
I
came
out
of
the
copse
along
the
road
they
were
both
gal-
loping
in
the
golden
distance
across
the
open
country
,
swaying
gracefully
and
rhythmically
in
their
saddles
and
were
galloping
not
in
the
direction
of
the
house
.
.
.
.
I
watched
them
.
.
.
.
They
soon
vanished
over
a
hill
,
brightly
lighted
by
the
sun
on
the
dark
line
of
the
horizon
.
I
stood
and
waited
,
with
slow
footsteps
went
back
into
the
wood
and
sat
down
on
a
little
path
,
covering
my
eyes
with
my
hands
.
I
have
noticed
when
one
meets
strangers
one
need
only
close
one
's
eyes
and
their
features
THREE
MEETINGS
at
once
rise
up
before
one
;
anyone
can
verify
the
truth
of
my
observations
in
the
street
.
The
more
famiHar
the
face
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
see
it
and
the
less
clear
is
its
expression
;
one
remembers
it
but
can
not
see
it
.
.
.
and
one
's
own
face
one
can
never
picture
.
.
.
each
separate
trait
,
however
slight
,
is
familiar
,
but
you
can
not
put
the
whole
image
together
.
And
so
I
sat
with
closed
eyes
and
at
once
saw
my
unknown
lady
and
her
companion
and
their
horses
and
everything
.
.
.
.
The
smiling
face
of
the
man
stood
out
before
me
with
peculiar
sharpness
and
distinctness
.
I
fell
to
looking
intently
at
it
...
it
grew
blurred
and
melted
away
into
a
crimson
mist
and
her
image
,
too
,
floated
away
after
it
and
sank
and
would
not
come
back
again
.
I
got
up
.
``
Well
,
''
I
thought
,
``
I
have
seen
them
,
anyway
,
have
seen
them
both
clearly
.
...
I
have
only
to
find
out
their
names
.
''
To
try
and
find
out
their
names
!
What
petty
,
in-
appropriate
curiosity
,
but
,
I
swear
,
it
was
not
curiosity
that
was
roused
in
me
:
it
really
seemed
to
me
impossible
not
to
find
out
at
least
who
they
were
after
chance
had
so
strangel
)
'
and
so
persistently
thrown
me
in
their
way
.
I
had
,
however
,
no
longer
the
same
impatient
perplexity
as
before
;
it
was
replaced
by
a
con-
fused
melancholy
feeling
of
which
I
was
a
lit-
tle
ashamed
.
...
I
was
filled
with
envy
.
.
.
.
I
did
not
hurry
back
to
the
house
.
I
must
own
I
began
to
be
ashamed
of
probing
another
person
's
secret
.
Moreover
the
appearance
of
the
loving
couple
by
day
in
the
sunlight
,
though
unexpected
and
,
I
repeat
,
strange
,
had
not
ex-
actly
calmed
,
but
,
as
it
were
,
cooled
me
off
.
I
saw
in
all
this
adventure
now
nothing
super-
natural
,
marvellous
.
.
.
nothing
like
an
incred-
ible
dream
.
...
?
I
began
shooting
again
with
more
attention
than
before
;
but
yet
I
had
no
real
enthusiasm
for
it
.
I
came
across
a
covey
and
it
kept
me
for
an
hour
and
a
half
.
.
.
.
The
young
snipe
for
a
long
time
did
not
call
in
response
to
my
whistle
probably
because
I
did
not
whistle
sufficiently
``
objectively
.
''
The
sun
had
risen
very
high
(
my
watch
said
twelve
o'clock
)
as
I
turned
my
steps
to
the
gar-
den
of
the
old
house
.
I
walked
without
haste
.
When
at
last
I
caught
a
glimpse
from
the
hill
THREE
MEETINGS
of
the
little
low
house
.
.
.
my
heart
began
quivering
again
.
I
drew
near
.
.
.
and
not
without
secret
satisfaction
caught
sight
of
Lukyanitch
.
He
was
sitting
as
before
motion-
less
on
the
bench
before
the
lodge
.
The
gates
were
shut
and
the
shutters
also
.
``
Good-day
,
old
man
,
''
I
shouted
from
some
distance
;
``
have
you
come
out
to
warm
your-
self
?
''
Lukyanitch
turned
his
face
towards
me
and
lifted
his
cap
without
speaking
.
I
went
up
to
him
.
``
Good-day
,
old
man
,
good-day
,
''
I
repeated
,
wanting
to
soften
him
.
``
How
's
this
,
''
I
added
,
chancing
to
see
my
new
quarter
rouble
on
the
ground
,
``
did
n't
you
see
it
?
''
And
I
pointed
to
the
little
silver
disc
half
sticking
out
in
the
short
grass
.
``
Yes
,
I
saw
it
.
''
``
Then
how
is
it
you
did
n't
pick
it
up
?
''
``
Oh
,
it
's
not
my
money
,
so
I
did
n't
pick
it
up
.
''
``
What
a
man
you
are
!
''
I
protested
not
with-
out
embarrassment
,
and
picking
up
the
quarter
rouble
I
held
it
out
to
him
again
.
``
Take
it
,
take
it
for
tea
.
''
``
Much
obliged
,
''
Lukyanitch
answered
me
with
a
calm
smile
.
``
There
's
no
need
;
we
do
well
as
it
is
;
much
obliged
.
''
``
But
I
am
ready
to
give
you
more
with
pleas-
ure
,
''
I
repHed
in
confusion
.
``
What
for
?
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
,
your
honour
mach
obliged
for
your
kindness
,
but
we
shall
have
bread
and
the
best
of
it
.
Maybe
more
than
we
can
eat
at
this
time
of
day
.
''
And
he
got
up
and
held
out
his
hand
towards
:
he
little
gate
.
``
Stay
,
stay
,
old
man
,
''
I
said
,
almost
in
de-
spair
.
``
How
unwilling
you
are
to
talk
to-day
,
really
.
.
.
.
Tell
me
,
at
any
rate
,
your
mistress
has
she
got
up
yet
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
And
...
is
she
at
home
?
''
``
No
,
her
honour
is
not
at
home
.
''
``
Has
she
driven
out
to
pay
visits
or
what
?
''
``
No
,
sir
,
she
has
gone
away
to
Moscow
.
''
``
To
Moscow
!
but
she
was
here
this
morn-
ing
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
l86
THREE
MEETINGS
''
And
she
slept
the
night
here
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
And
she
had
only
come
a
little
while
ago
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
Then
how
is
it
,
my
man
?
''
``
Why
,
it
will
be
an
hour
ago
her
honour
was
pleased
to
set
off
for
Moscow
again
.
''
``
To
Moscow
!
''
I
stared
at
Lukyanitch
in
stupefaction
;
this
,
I
own
,
I
had
not
expected
.
.
.
.
And
Lukyanitch
looked
at
me
.
The
cunning
smile
of
old
age
twisted
his
dry
lips
and
faintly
gleamed
in
his
mournful
eyes
.
``
And
she
has
gone
with
her
sister
?
''
I
brought
out
at
last
.
``
Yes
.
''
``
So
that
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
now
?
''
``
No
.
.
.
.
''
``
The
old
man
is
deceiving
me
,
''
flashed
through
my
mind
;
``
that
cunning
smile
is
not
for
nothing
.
''
``
Listen
,
Lukyanitch
,
''
I
said
aloud
,
``
will
you
do
me
a
favour
?
''
``
What
is
your
pleasure
?
''
he
brought
out
tHE
TV/0
FRlENIDS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
slowly
,
evidently
beginning
to
be
worried
by
my
questions
.
``
You
say
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
;
can
you
show
it
to
me
?
''
``
That
is
,
you
want
to
look
at
the
rooms
?
''
``
Yes
,
at
the
rooms
.
''
Lukyanitch
was
silent
for
a
space
.
``
Certainly
,
''
he
brought
out
at
last
,
``
Please
come
.
.
.
.
''
And
bending
down
,
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
of
the
little
gate
.
I
followed
him
.
Crossing
the
little
yard
,
we
mounted
the
shaky
steps
.
The
old
man
pushed
open
the
door
;
there
was
no
lock
on
it
.
A
cord
with
a
loop
hung
through
the
key-hole
.
.
.
.
We
went
into
the
house
.
It
consisted
of
five
or
six
low-
pitched
rooms
and
,
as
far
as
I
could
distinguish
in
the
faint
light
which
percolated
scantily
through
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
,
the
furni-
ture
in
the
rooms
was
very
plain
and
decrepit
.
In
one
of
them
(
the
one
which
looked
out
into
the
garden
)
there
stood
a
little
old
piano
.
.
.
.
I
raised
the
bent
cover
and
struck
the
keys
:
a
sour
hissing
note
rang
out
and
peevishly
died
away
as
through
complaining
of
my
impudence
;
i88
THREE
MEETINGS
there
was
no
sign
from
which
one
could
have
guessed
that
people
had
just
lately
left
the
house
;
there
was
a
smell
in
it
of
something
deathly
and
stifling
not
as
though
it
were
lived
in
;
only
a
scrap
of
paper
lying
about
here
and
there
showed
by
its
whiteness
that
it
had
not
been
here
long
.
I
picked
up
one
such
scrap
of
paper-
;
it
turned
out
to
be
a
bit
of
a
letter
;
on
one
side
in
a
bold
feminine
hand
were
traced
the
words
``
se
tdre
?
''
;
on
the
other
side
I
made
out
the
word
``
bonhenr
.
''
.
.
.
On
a
little
round
table
by
the
window
there
stood
a
nosegay
of
half-withered
flowers
and
a
crumpled
green
ribbon
lay
beside
it
.
...
I
took
that
little
rib-
bon
for
a
souvenir
.
Lukyanitch
opened
a
nar-
row
door
which
was
papered
like
the
wall
.
``
Here
,
''
he
said
,
stretching
out
his
hand
,
''
this
is
a
bedroom
and
there
beyond
it
is
the
maid
's
room
,
and
there
are
no
other

ments
.
''
We
walked
back
along
the
passage
.
``
And
what
room
is
that
?
''
I
asked
,
pointing
to
a
broad
white
door
with
a
lock
.
``
That
,
''
Lukyanitch
answered
in
a
hollow
voice
,
``

It
's
a

and
nothing

.
.
'
``

I
said
,
though
inwardly
as'-.^rred
of
my
miseemly
pertinacity
.
``

.
''
I
felt
ashamed
;
I
could
not
tnish
the
litde
speech
I
had
begun
.
Lukyanitdi
stood
with
his
grey
head
droop-
ing
on
his
breast
,
and
kept
looking
at
me
some-
what
strangely
from
under
his
brows
.
``
Show
it
me
,
''
I
said
.
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
''
he
answered
at
last
,
took
out
the
key
and
reluctantly
unlocked
the
door
.
I
glanced
into
the
storeroom
.
There
cer-
tainly
was
nothing
remarkable
in
it
.
On
the
walls
there
were
old
portraits
with
gloomy
,
al-
THREE
MEETINGS
most
black
faces
and
an^-
eyes
.
The
floor
was
littered
with
all
sorts
of
rubbish
.
``
Well
,
have
you
looked
at
it
?
''
Luk
}
-anitch
asked
me
grimly
.
``
Yes
,
thank
you
,
''
I
answered
hurriedly
.
He
slammed
the
door
.
I
went
into
the
hall
and
from
the
hall
into
the
court
)
-ard
.
Lukj-anitch
saw^
me
out
,
muttered
:
``
I
wish
you
good-day
,
''
and
was
going
off
to
his
lodge
.
``
And
what
lady
was
it
staying
here
,
yester-
day
?
''
I
called
after
him
.
``
I
met
her
to-day
in
the
copse
.
''
I
hoped
to
take
him
unawares
by
my
sudden
question
and
to
evoke
an
unconsidered
answer
.
But
the
old
man
only
gave
a
toneless
laugh
and
,
going
into
his
lodge
,
slammed
the
door
.
I
went
back
to
Glinnoye
.
I
felt
uncomfort-
able
,
like
a
boy
who
has
been
put
to
shame
.
``
Xo
,
''
I
said
to
myself
.
``
It
seems
I
am
not
to
get
tD
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
.
Bother
it
,
I
wo
n't
think
any
more
about
it
.
''
An
hour
later
I
was
driving
home
,
thor-
oughly
irritated
and
out
of
humour
.
A
week
passed
.
In
spite
of
my
efforts
to
drive
away
the
thought
of
my
unknown
lady
,
of
her
companion
,
of
my
meeting
with
them
,
it
was
continually
returning
and
haunting
me
with
the
tiresome
persistence
of
an
after-dinner
fly
.
.
.
.
Lukyanitch
with
his
mysterious
glances
and
reserved
speeches
,
with
his
cold
,
melancholy
smile
was
incessantly
recurring
to
my
mind
also
.
The
house
itself
,
when
I
re-
called
it
,
the
very
house
itself
,
seemed
looking
slyly
and
stupidly
at
me
through
its
half-closed
shutters
and
,
as
it
were
,
taunted
me
and
seemed
to
be
saying
to
me
:
'
``
And
after
all
you
know
nothing
!
''
At
last
I
could
not
restrain
my-
self
and
one
fine
day
drove
over
to
Glin-
noye
and
from
Glinnoye
set
off
on
foot
.
.
.
.
Whither
?
The
reader
can
easily
guess
.
I
must
confess
that
as
I
approached
the
mys-
terious
garden
I
was
aware
of
rather
strong
excitement
.
There
was
no
change
in
the
outer
appearance
of
the
house
;
the
same
closed
win-
dows
,
the
same
forlorn
and
dejected
air
;
only
instead
of
Lukyanitch
a
young
servant-lad
of
twenty
in
a
full
,
long
nankeen
coat
and
a
red
shirt
was
sitting
on
the
bench
before
the
lodge
.
``
Good-day
,
my
lad
,
''
I
said
in
a
loud
voice
.
THREE
MEETINGS
He
jumped
up
at
once
and
opened
wide
his
startled
eyes
.
``
Good-day
,
my
lad
,
''
I
repeated
;
``
where
is
the
old
man
?
''
``
What
old
man
?
''
the
youth
brought
out
slowly
.
``
Lukyanitch
.
''
``
Ah
,
Lukyanitch
!
''
He
looked
away
.
``
Do
you
want
Lukyanitch
?
''
``
Yes
,
Lukyanitch
.
Is
he
at
home
?
''
``
N-no
,
''
the
lad
pronounced
,
hesitating
,
``
he
is
.
.
.
How
shall
I
tell
you
?
.
.
.
''
``
Is
he
unwell
or
what
?
''
``
No
.
''
``
Then
what
is
it
?
''
``
Why
,
he
is
n't
here
at
all
.
''
``
Not
here
?
''
``
No
.
Something
bad
.
.
.
has
happened
to
him
.
.
.
.
''
``
Is
he
dead
?
''
I
asked
with
amazement
.
``
He
strangled
himself
.
''
``
Strangled
himself
!
''
I
cried
with
horror
and
flung
up
my
hands
.
We
looked
into
each
other
's
faces
without
speaking
.
``
Was
it
long
ago
?
''
I
asked
at
last
.
``
Just
five
days
ago
.
He
was
buried
yester-
day
.
''
``
But
why
did
he
strangle
himself
?
''
``
The
Lord
knows
.
He
was
a
free
man
,
he
had
a
salary
;
he
wanted
for
nothing
,
his
mis-
tresses
looked
after
him
as
though
he
were
one
of
their
kin
.
They
are
good
to
us
,
you
know
,
God
bless
them
.
There
is
simply
no
making
out
what
came
over
him
.
The
Evil
One
must
have
confounded
him
.
''
``
But
how
did
he
do
it
?
''
``
Why
,
he
just
took
and
strangled
himself
.
''
``
Was
there
nothing
noticed
about
him
be-
fore
?
''
``
What
can
I
say
?
.
.
.
Nothing
so
to
say
special
.
...
He
was
always
a
dreary
,
suspi-
cious
man
!
He
would
be
sighing
and
groaning
.
*I
feel
dreary
,
'
he
would
say
.
And
then
there
was
his
age
,
you
see
.
Of
late
he
certainly
had
begun
to
brood
a
bit
.
He
would
come
some-
times
to
see
us
in
the
village
;
and
I
am
his
nephew
,
you
know
.
'Well
,
my
boy
,
'
he
would
say
,
'come
and
stay
the
night
with
me
,
will
you
?
'
'Why
,
uncle
?
'
'Oh
,
I
feel
a
bit
fright-
THREE
MEETINGS
ened
somehow
and
dreary
by
myself
.
.
.
.
*
Well
,
and
I
would
come
to
him
.
He
would
come
out
into
the
yard
,
and
look
and
look
like
this
at
the
house
,
would
shake
his
head
and
heave
a
sigh
.
.
.
.
Before
the
very
night
in
which
he
put
an
end
to
his
life
,
he
came
to
us
and
asked
me
to
go
.
Well
,
I
came
.
So
when
we
reached
the
lodge
,
he
sat
a
little
on
the
bench
;
then
he
got
up
and
went
out
.
I
went
into
the
yard
and
cried
,
'Uncle
,
hey
,
uncle
!
'
Uncle
did
not
call
back
.
I
thought
,
'Where
can
he
have
gone
,
not
into
the
house
surely
?
'
And
I
went
into
the
house
.
It
was
beginning
to
get
dark
.
Well
,
as
I
passed
by
the
store-
room
I
heard
something
scraping
behind
the
door
;
I
took
and
opened
the
door
,
and
there
he
was
sitting
squatting
under
the
window
.
'What
are
you
doing
here
,
uncle
?
'
said
I
.
How
he
turned
round
and
shouted
at
me
!
and
his
eyes
looked
about
so
quickly
,
they
were
burn-
ing
like
a
cat
's
.
'What
do
you
vi^ant
?
Don't
you
see
I
am
shaving
?
'
And
his
voice
was
so
husky
.
My
hair
stood
on
end
to
hear
him
and
I
felt
frightened
,
I
do
n't
know
why
.
.
.
.
The
devils
must
have
been
round
him
by
that
time
.
'In
the
dark
?
'
I
said
,
and
my
knees
were
shak-
ing
.
'Oh
,
'
said
he
,
``
that
is
all
right
.
Run
along
.
'
I
went
away
and
he
came
out
of
the
storeroom
and
locked
it
up
.
So
we
went
back
to
the
lodge
and
my
fright
passed
off
at
once
.
'What
were
you
doing
in
the
storeroom
,
un-
cle
?
'
I
said
.
He
fairly
started
.
'Hold
your
tongue
,
'
and
he
got
on
his
bed
.
'Well
,
'
thought
I
,
'I
had
better
not
talk
to
him
:
it
seems
he
is
not
quite
the
thing
to-day
,
'
so
I
went
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
,
too
.
And
the
night
lamp
was
burning
in
the
corner
.
So
I
lay
down
and
dropped
asleep
,
you
know
.
.
.
.
All
at
once
I
heard
the
door
creak
softly
and
open
just
a
little
.
And
uncle
was
lying
with
his
back
to
the
door
,
and
,
as
you
remember
,
maybe
,
he
was
always
hard
of
hearing
.
But
he
jumped
up
at
once
.
.
.
'Who
is
calling
me
,
eh
?
who
?
He
has
come
for
me
,
for
me
!
'
And
he
went
out
into
the
yard
without
his
cap
.
...
I
won-
dered
what
was
the
matter
with
him
and
then
like
a
sinner
I
fell
asleep
.
When
I
woke
up
next
morning
Lukyanitch
was
not
there
.
I
went
out
of
the
room
and
began
calling
him
he
was
nowhere
.
I
asked
the
watchman
:
THREE
MEETINGS
'Did
n't
)
^ou
see
uncle
go
out
?
'
'No
,
'
he
said
,
'I
did
n't
.
'
'Well
,
brother
,
'
said
I
,
'he
's
gone
somehow
.
.
.
.
'
Oy
!
we
were
both
scared
!
'Let
us
go
,
Fedoseyitch
,
'
I
said
,
'let
us
go
and
see
whether
he
is
in
the
house
.
'
'Very
well
,
Vassily
Timofeyitch
,
'
he
said
,
and
he
looked
as
white
as
clay
.
We
went
into
the
house
.
.
.
.
When
we
passed
the
storeroom
I
looked
and
the
padlock
was
hanging
open
on
the
staple
.
I
pushed
at
the
door
and
it
was
bolted
in-
side
.
.
.
.
Fedoseyitch
ran
round
to
look
in
at
the
window
.
.
.
.
'Vassily
Timofeyitch
!
'
he
cried
,
'there
are
legs
hanging
,
legs
!
'
...
!
ran
to
the
window
.
And
the
legs
were
his
,
Luk-
yanitch
's
legs
.
He
had
hanged
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
.
.
.
Well
,
we
sent
for
the
police
.
.
.
.
They
took
him
down
;
the
cord
was
tied
with
twelve
knots
.
''
``
Well
,
what
did
the
Court
decide
?
''
``
What
did
they
decide
?
Why
,
nothing
.
They
thought
and
thought
what
could
be
the
reason
of
it
.
There
was
no
reason
for
it
.
So
they
concluded
that
it
must
be
supposed
that
he
was
out
of
his
mind
.
He
had
headaches
of
late
;
often
he
would
keep
complaining
of
his
head
.
''
I
talked
to
the
lad
for
another
half-hour
and
went
away
completely
bewildered
.
I
must
con-
fess
that
I
could
not
look
at
that
decrepit
house
without
a
secret
superstitious
terror
.
...
A
month
later
I
went
away
from
the
country
and
by
degrees
all
these
horrors
and
mysterious
meetings
passed
out
of
my
mind
.
II
Three
years
had
passed
.
I
spent
the
greater
part
of
that
time
in
Petersburg
and
abroad
and
if
I
went
home
to
the
country
it
was
only
for
a
few
days
,
so
that
I
did
not
once
happen
to
be
in
Glinnoye
or
Mihailovskoye
.
Nor
did
I
see
my
beautiful
lady
nor
her
companion
.
One
day
towards
the
end
of
the
third
year
I
chanced
to
meet
,
at
an
evening
party
given
by
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
in
Moscow
,
Madame
Shly-
kov
and
her
sister
Pelageya
Badayev
,
the
very
Pelageya
whom
I
had
,
like
a
sinner
,
supposed
till
then
to
be
a
fictitious
person
.
The
two
ladies
were
no
longer
young
,
but
THREE
MEETINGS
were
of
rather
agreeable
appearance
.
Their
conversation
was
distinguished
by
intelligence
and
liveliness
,
they
had
travelled
a
great
deal
and
had
profited
by
their
travels
;
a
spontane-
ous
gaiety
was
conspicuous
in
their
behaviour
.
But
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
common
between
them
and
my
mysterious
lady
.
I
was
introduced
to
them
.
I
got
into
conversation
with
Madame
Shlykov
(
her
sister
's
attention
was
taken
up
by
a
distinguished
scientific
vis-
itor
,
a
geologist
)
.
I
told
her
that
I
had
the
pleasure
of
being
her
neighbour
in
the
X.
district
.
``
Yes
,
I
have
a
little
estate
there
,
''
she
said
,
''
near
Glinnoye
.
''
``
To
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
,
''
I
answered
.
``
I
know
your
Mihailovskoye
.
Do
you
stay
there
?
''
``
Rarely
.
''
``
You
were
there
three
years
ago
.
''
``
Wait
a
minute
,
I
believe
I
was
;
yes
,
I
was
.
''
``
Alone
,
or
with
your
sister
?
''
She
glanced
at
me
.
``
With
my
sister
.
We
went
down
there
for
a
week
,
you
know
,
on
business
.
But
we
saw
no
one
.
''
``
H
'm
.
You
have
very
few
neighbours
there
,
I
beheve
?
''
``
Yes
,
very
few
.
And
I
am
not
very
eager
to
see
them
.
''
``
Tell
me
,
''
I
began
,
``
I
believe
something
dreadful
happened
that
year
.
Lukyanitch
.
.
.
''
Madame
Shlykov
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
once
.
``
Did
you
know
him
?
''
she
asked
eagerly
.
``
What
a
dreadful
thing
.
He
was
such
a
splen-
did
,
good
old
man
.
.
.
.
And
only
fancy
,
for
no
sort
of
reason
.
''
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
I
muttered
,
``
a
dreadful
thing
,
.
.
.
''
Her
sister
came
up
to
us
.
She
was
prob-
ably
bored
by
the
learned
disquisitions
of
the
geologist
on
the
formation
of
the
banks
of
the
Volga
.
``
Only
fancy
,
Pauline
,
''
Madame
Shlykov
be-
gan
,
``
Monsieur
knew
Lukyanitch
.
''
``
Really
?
Poor
old
man
.
''
``
I
went
shooting
near
Mihailovskoye
more
than
once
at
the
time
you
were
there
three
years
ago
,
''
I
observed
.
``
I
?
''
said
Pelageya
in
some
perplexity
.
``
Why
,
yes
,
of
course
,
''
her
sister
put
in
hur-
THREE
MEETINGS
rtedly
.
``
Do
n't
you
remember
?
''
and
she
looked
intently
into
her
eyes
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
...
to
be
sure
!
''
Pelageya
an-
swered
all
at
once
.
``
Heigh-ho
!
''
I
thought
,
``
I
doubt
whether
you
were
there
,
my
dear
!
''
``
Wo
n't
you
sing
us
something
,
Pelageya
Fyodorovna
?
''
a
tall
young
man
,
with
a
shock
of
flaxen
hair
and
lustreless
sugary
eyes
,
said
suddenly
.
``
I
really
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Badayev
.
``
You
sing
?
''
I
exclaimed
eagerly
and
got
up
from
my
seat
.
``
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
oh
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
sing
us
something
!
''
``
Why
,
what
shall
I
sing
you
?
''
``
Do
n't
you
know
,
''
I
asked
,
doing
my
ut-
most
to
appear
unconcerned
and
free
and
easy
,
''
an
Italian
song
;
it
begins
.
.
.
Passa
que'
colli
?
''
``
Yes
,
I
know
it
,
''
answered
Pelageya
quite
innocently
.
``
Why
,
shall
I
sing
it
to
you
?
Cer-
tainly
.
''
And
she
sat
down
to
the
piano
.
I
,
like
Ham-
let
,
fastened
my
eyes
on
Madame
Shlykov
.
I
fancied
that
at
the
first
note
she
gave
a
faint
start
;
she
sat
through
it
quietly
,
however
.
Mademoiselle
Badayev
sang
well
.
The
song
ended
and
the
usual
applause
followed
.
Peo-
ple
began
begging
her
to
sing
something
more
,
but
the
sisters
excTianged
glances
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
took
leave
.
As
they
were
going
out
of
the
room
I
overheard
the
word
:
''
Imp
or
tun
.
''
``
Well
deserved
,
''
I
thought
,
and
I
did
not
meet
them
again
.
Another
year
passed
.
I
went
to
live
in
Petersburg
.
Winter
came
on
and
masked
balls
began
.
Coming
out
from
a
friend
's
house
at
eleven
o'clock
one
evening
,
I
felt
so
depressed
that
I
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
the
masked
ball
at
the
Hall
of
Nobility
.
For
a
long
while
I
wandered
beside
the
columns
and
by
the
mir-
rors
,
with
a
modestly
Byronic
expression
on
my
face
,
that
expression
which
as
far
as
I
can
observe
is
seen
even
in
the
most
well-bred
peo-
ple
on
such
occasions
why
,
the
Lord
only
knows
;
for
a
long
while
I
hung
about
,
at
rare
intervals
shaking
off
with
a
jest
shrill
dominos
with
dubious
lace
and
dirty
gloves
,
and
at
still
THREE
MEETINGS
rarer
intervals
entering
into
conversation
with
them
myself
;
for
a
long
time
I
resigned
my
ears
to
the
hlare
of
the
trumpets
and
the
screech
of
the
fiddles
.
At
last
after
being
bored
tO
'
my
heart
's
content
and
having
acquired
a
headache
,
I
decided
to
go
home
.
.
.
and
.
.
.
and
I
stayed
on
.
...
I
saw
a
woman
in
a
black
domino
leaning
against
a
column
.
I
saw
her
,
stopped
,
went
up
to
her
and
.
.
.
will
the
readers
believe
me
?
...
at
once
recognised
her
as
my
unknown
lady
.
How
I
recognised
her
whether
from
the
look
she
cast
carelessly
upon
me
through
the
long
slits
in
the
mask
,
or
from
the
divine
curve
of
her
arm
and
shoul-
ders
,
or
from
the
peculiar
feminine
grandeur
of
her
whole
figure
,
or
from
some
mysterious
prompting
that
suddenly
spoke
within
me
,
I
can
not
say
.
.
.
but
I
did
.
With
a
tremor
at
my
heart
I
walked
by
her
two
or
three
times
.
She
did
not
stir
;
in
her
attitude
there
was
some-
thing
so
hopelessly
sorrowful
that
,
looking
at
her
,
I
involuntarily
recalled
two
lines
from
a
Spanish
ballad
:
Soy
un
cuadro
de
tristeza
,
Arrimado
a
la
pared
.
I
walked
behind
the
column
against
which
she
was
leaning
and
bending
down
close
to
her
ear
,
softly
pronounced
:
``
Passa
que
'
colli
.
''
.
.
.
She
started
all
over
and
turned
quickly
to
me
.
Our
eyes
met
so
close
that
I
was
able
to
detect
how
her
pupils
dilated
with
fear
.
She
stared
at
me
in
bewilderment
,
weakly
stretch-
ing
out
one
hand
.
``
May
6th
,
184
,
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
eve-
ning
,
in
Sorrento
,
in
the
Via
della
Croce
,
''
I
said
in
a
deliberate
voice
,
not
taking
my
eyes
off
her
,
``
then
in
Russia
in
X.
province
,
at
the
hamlet
of
!
Mihailovskoye
on
July
12th
,
.
''
I
said
all
this
in
French
.
She
drew
a
little
back
,
scanned
me
from
head
to
foot
with
as-
tonished
eyes
,
and
whispering
``
Vencz

''
walked
hurriedly
out
of
the
ballroom
;
I
followed
her
.
We
walked
in
silence
.
I
can
not
attempt
to
describe
my
feelings
as
I
walked
beside
her
.
A
lovely
vision
which
should
suddenly
become
a
living
reality
.
.
.
the
statue
of
Galatea
step-
ping
down
from
the
pedestal
,
a
living
woman
,
before
the
eyes
of
Pygmalion
,
faint
with
ex-
pectation
.
...
I
could
not
believe
my
senses
,
THREE
MEETINGS
I
could
hardly
breathe
.
We
walked
through
several
rooms
.
At
last
in
one
of
them
she
stopped
before
a
small
sofa
in
the
window
and
sat
down
.
I
sat
down
beside
her
.
She
slowly
turned
her
head
towards
me
and
looked
at
me
intently
.
``
Do
you
...
do
you
come
from
him
?
''
she
said
.
Her
voice
was
weak
and
uncertain
.
Her
question
confused
me
a
little
.
``
No
.
.
.
not
from
him
,
''
I
said
,
faltering
.
``
Do
you
know
him
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
I
answered
with
mysterious
impor-
tance
.
I
wanted
to
keep
up
my
part
.
``
I
know
him
.
''
She
gazed
at
me
distrustfully
,
would
have
said
something
and
looked
down
.
``
You
were
expecting
him
in
Sorrento
,
''
I
went
on
.
``
You
saw
him
at
Mihailovskoye
,
you
went
for
a
ride
with
him
.
.
.
.
''
``
How
could
you
.
.
.
''
she
began
.
``
I
know
,
I
know
everything
!
''
``
Your
face
seems
somehow
familiar
to
me
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
but
no
.
.
.
.
''
``
No
,
I
am
unknown
to
you
.
''
``
Then
what
do
you
want
?
''
``
Well
,
I
know
,
''
I
repeated
.
I
understood
very
well
that
I
ought
to
take
advantage
of
this
excellent
opening
,
to
go
fur-
ther
,
that
my
repetitions
:
``
I
know
everything
,
I
know
,
''
were
becoming
ridiculous
,
but
my
emotion
was
so
great
,
this
unexpected
meeting
so
troubled
me
,
I
was
so
overwhelmed
that
I
was
absolutely
unable
to
say
anything
else
.
And
all
the
while
I
really
knew
nothing
.
I
felt
that
I
was
being
stupid
,
that
from
a
mys-
terious
,
omniscient
being
such
as
I
must
have
seemed
to
her
at
first
,
I
was
rapidly
turning
into
a
sort
of
grinning
idiot
.
.
.
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
.
``
Yes
,
I
know
everything
,
''
I
muttered
once
more
.
She
looked
at
me
,
hurriedly
got
up
and
was
about
to
retreat
.
But
that
would
have
been
too
much
.
I
clutched
at
her
hand
.
``
For
God
's
sake
,
''
I
be-
gan
,
``
sit
down
,
listen
to
me
.
.
.
.
''
She
thought
a
moment
and
sat
down
.
``
I
told
you
just
now
,
''
I
went
on
with
fer-
vour
,
``
that
I
know
everything
that
is
nonsense
I
know
nothing
,
absolutely
nothing
;
I
don't
THREE
MEETINGS
know
who
you
are
or
who
'he
'
is
and
that
I
could
astound
you
by
what
I
said
just
now
by
the
column
you
must
put
down
to
chance
alone
,
a
strange
,
incomprehensible
chance
which
,
as
though
in
mockery
of
me
,
threw
me
beside
you
twice
and
almost
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
made
me
the
involuntary
witness
of
what
you
desired
perhaps
to
keep
secret
.
.
.
.
''
And
on
the
spot
,
without
suppressing
or
al-
tering
anything
,
I
told
her
the
whole
story
:
my
meeting
with
her
in
Sorrento
,
in
Russia
,
my
vain
enquiries
at
Mihailovskoye
,
even
my
con-
versation
in
Moscow
with
Madame
Shlykov
and
her
sister
.
``
Now
you
know
all
about
it
,
''
I
said
as
I
fin-
ished
my
story
.
``
I
am
not
going
to
describe
to
you
what
a
deep
,
what
a
shattering
,
impres-
sion
you
made
upon
me
;
to
see
you
and
not
be
enchanted
by
you
is
impossible
.
On
the
other
hand
there
is
no
object
in
my
telling
you
what
sort
of
impression
it
was
either
.
Think
un-
der
what
circumstances
I
saw
you
on
both
oc-
casions
.
Believe
me
,
I
have
no
inclination
to
abandon
myself
to
mad
hopes
,
but
you
will
un-
derstand
also
the
unutterable
emotion
which
overwhelmed
me
to-day
and
will
pardon
me
,
will
pardon
the
awkward
duplicity
to
which
I
brought
myself
to
resort
,
to
attract
your
atten-
tion
if
only
for
a
moment
.
.
.
.
''
She
listened
to
my
confused
explanations
without
raising
her
head
.
``
What
do
you
want
from
me
?
''
she
said
at
last
.
``
Want
?
I
want
nothing
...
I
am
happy
as
it
is
...
I
have
too
much
respect
for
the-
se-
crets
of
others
.
''
``
Really
?
Yet
you
seem
so
far
,
.
.
.
How-
ever
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
I
don't-
want
,
to
reproach
,
you
.
Anyone
would
have
done
the
same
in
your
place
.
Besides
,
chance
really
has
so
per-
sistently
thrown
us
together
.
That
,
as
it
were
,
gives
you
a
certain
claim
on
my
candour
.
Lis-
ten
,
I
am
not
one
of
those
misunderstood
and
unhappy
women
who
go
to
masked
balls
to
chatter
to
the
first
person
they
meet
of
their
sufferings
,
who
want
to
find
hearts
filled
with
sympathy
...
I
need
no
one
's
sympathy
,
my
own
heart
is
dead
and
I
have
come
here
sim-
ply
to
bury
it
for
ever
.
''
She
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips.
''
THREE
MEETINGS
''
I
hope
,
''
sHe
went
on
with
some
effort
,
``
that
you
do
not
take
my
words
for
the
ordinary
masquerade
outpourings
.
You
must
under-
stand
that
I
am
in
no
mood
for
that
.
.
.
.
''
And
certainly
there
was
something
terrible
in
her
voice
for
all
the
insinuating
softness
of
its
tone
.
``
I
am
Russian
,
''
she
said
in
Russian
till
then
she
had
spoken
French
``
though
I
have
lived
little
in
Russia
.
.
.
.
There
is
no
need
for
you
to
know
my
name
.
Anna
Fyodorovna
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
;
I
did
in
fact
go
down
to
Mihailovskoye
in
her
sister
's
name
.
At
that
time
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
see
him
openly
.
.
.
and
people
were
beginning
to
talk
as
it
was
.
...
At
that
time
there
were
obstacles
,
he
was
not
free
.
.
.
.
But
the
man
whose
name
should
have
been
mine
,
the
man
with
whom
you
saw
me
,
has
abandoned
me
.
''
She
made
a
movement
with
her
hand
and
paused
.
``
You
really
do
not
know
him
,
you
have
not
met
him
?
''
``
Not
once
.
''
``
He
has
been
almost
all
this
time
abroad
.
But
he
is
here
now
.
.
.
.
That
is
all
my
story
,
''
she
added
;
``
you
see
there
is
nothing
mysteri-
ous
,
nothing
special
in
it
.
''
``
And
Sorrento
?
''
I
broke
in
timidly
.
``
I
got
to
know
him
in
Sorrento
,
''
she
an-
swered
slowly
,
and
she
sank
into
musing
.
We
were
both
silent
.
I
was
strangely
troubled
.
I
was
sitting
beside
her
,
beside
the
woman
whose
image
had
so
often
haunted
my
dreams
and
had
so
poignantly
thrilled
and
dis-
turbed
me
;
I
was
sitting
beside
her
and
felt
a
chill
and
a
weight
on
my
heart
.
I
knew
that
nothing
would
come
of
this
meeting
,
that
be-
tween
her
and
me
there
was
an
abyss
,
that
when
we
separated
we
should
part
for
ever
.
With
her
head
craned
forward
and
both
hands
dropped
on
her
knees
she
sat
carelessly
and
apathetically
.
I
know
that
carelessness
of
grief
that
can
not
be
healed
,
I
know
the
apathy
of
hopeless
misery
!
Masked
figures
walked
by
us
in
couples
,
the
strains
of
the
``
mad
and
monotonous
''
valse
sounded
at
one
minute
dimly
in
the
distance
,
at
the
next
floated
to
us
in
shrill
gusts
of
sound
;
the
gay
dance
music
moved
me
to
dejection
THREE
MEETINGS
and
melancholy
.
``
Can
this
be
the
woman
,
''
I
thought
,
``
who
appeared
to
nie
at
the
window
of
that
far-away
little
country
house
in
all
the
glory
of
triumphant
beauty
?
''
.
.
.
And
yet
it
seemed
as
though
time
had
not
touched
her
.
The
lower
part
of
her
face
not
covered
by
her
lace
mask
had
almost
the
softness
of
childhood
;
but
there
was
a
chilliness
about
it
as
about
a
statue
.
.
.
.
Galatea
had
stepped
back
onto
her
pedestal
and
there
would
be
no
coming
down
from
it
again
.
All
at
once
she
drew
herself
up
,
looked
towards
the
other
room
and
rose
from
her
seat
.
``
Give
me
your
arm
,
''
she
said
,
``
make
haste
,
let
us
go
,
make
haste
.
''
We
went
back
into
the
ballroom
.
She
walked
so
quickly
that
I
could
hardly
keep
up
with
her
.
She
stopped
at
a
column
.
``
Let
us
wait
here
,
''
she
whispered
.
``
You
are
looking
for
someone
,
''
I
began
.
But
she
paid
no
attention
to
me
;
her
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
the
crowd
.
Her
big
black
eyes
looked
yearningly
and
menacingly
from
under
the
black
velvet
.
I
turned
in
the
direction
of
her
eyes
and
understood
.
Along
the
corridor
formed
by
the
rows
of
columns
and
the
wall
he
,
the
man
I
had
met
with
her
in
the
copse
,
was
coming
.
I
knew
him
at
once
;
he
had
scarcely
changed
.
His
fair
moustache
curled
as
handsomely
,
his
brown
eyes
gleamed
with
the
same
calm
and
self-confident
gaiety
.
He
was
walking
with-
out
haste
,
and
,
his
slender
figure
slightly
bent
,
was
telling
something
to
a
woman
in
a
domino
who
was
on
his
arm
.
As
he
reached
us
he
suddenly
raised
his
head
,
glanced
first
at
me
and
then
at
the
woman
with
whom
I
was
stand-
ing
and
apparently
recognised
her
,
recognised
her
eyes
,
for
his
eyebrows
twitched
faintly
.
He
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
his
lips
curved
in
a
scarcely
perceptible
but
insufferably
insolent
sneer
.
He
bent
down
to
his
companion
,
whis-
pered
a
couple
of
words
in
her
ear
;
she
at
once
looked
round
,
her
little
blue
eyes
hastily
scanned
us
both
and
,
softly
laughing
,
she
shook
her
lit-
tle
hand
at
him
reprovingly
.
She
faintly
shrugged
one
shoulder
and
coquettishly
nestled
up
to
him
.
...
I
turned
round
to
my
unknown
lady
.
She
was
looking
after
the
retreating
couple
and
sud-
THREE
MEETINGS
denly
withdrawing
her
hand
from
my
arm
rushed
towards
the
door
.
I
was
hastening
after
her
,
but
turning
round
she
glanced
at
me
in
such
a
way
that
I
made
her
a
deep
bow
and
stayed
where
I
was
.
I
felt
that
to
pursue
her
would
be
coarse
and
stupid
.
``
Please
tell
me
,
old
man
,
''
I
said
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
to
an
acquaintance
of
mine
,
who
was
a
living
directory
for
Petersburg
,
''
who
is
that
tall
,
handsome
man
with
mous-
taches
?
''
``
That
one
?
.
.
.
He
's
a
foreigner
,
rather
an
enigmatic
creature
who
very
rarely
appears
on
our
horizon
.
Why
do
you
ask
?
''
``
Oh
,
nothing
.
.
.
.
''
I
went
home
.
Since
then
I
have
never
met
my
unknown
lady
.
Knowing
the
name
of
the
man
she
loved
,
I
could
no
doubt
have
found
out
who
she
was
,
but
I
did
not
want
to
.
I
have
said
already
That
this
woman
had
appeared
to
me
like
a
vision
and
like
a
vision
she
passed
by
and
vanished
for
ever
.

A
QUIET
BACKWATER
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
CHAPTER
I
In
a
rather
large
,
recently
whitewashed
room
in
the
manor-lodge
of
the
village
of
Sasovo
in
the
district
of
X.
,
in
the
province
of
T.
,
a
young
man
in
an
overcoat
was
sitting
on
a
narrow
wooden
chair
at
a
little
old
warped
table
,
looking
through
his
accounts
.
Two
can-
dles
in
silver
travelling
candlesticks
were
burn-
ing
before
him
;
on
a
bench
in
one
corner
stood
an
open
provision
basket
,
in
another
a
servant
was
putting
up
an
iron
bedstead
.
A
samovar
was
grumbling
and
hissing
behind
the
partition
wall
;
a
dog
was
turning
round
and
round
on
some
hay
that
had
just
been
brought
in
.
A
peasant
with
a
big
beard
and
an
intelligent
face
,
in
a
new
full
coat
tied
round
the
waist
with
a
red
scarf
,
apparently
the
village
elder
,
was
standing
in
the
doorway
,
intently
watching
the
young
man
at
the
table
.
A
very
old
,
diminu-
tive
piano
stood
against
one
wall
beside
a
chest
of
drawers
as
ancient
,
with
holes
instead
of
locks
;
a
dark
looking-glass
was
visible
between
the
windows
;
on
the
partition
wall
hung
an
old
portrait
with
the
paint
peeling
off
the
canvas
,
representing
a
lady
in
a
farthingale
,
with
pow-
dered
hair
and
a
black
ribbon
round
her
slen-
der
neck
.
To
judge
from
the
perceptible
crookedness
of
the
ceiling
and
the
slope
of
the
floor
which
was
full
of
crevices
,
the
little
lodge
to
which
we
have
introduced
the
reader
had
existed
for
long
ages
;
no
one
was
permanently
living
in
it
;
it
served
for
the
landowner
on
his
visits
.
The
young
man
sitting
at
the
table
was
the
owner
of
the
village
of
Sasovo
.
He
had
arrived
only
the
evening
before
from
a
larger
estate
about
eighty
miles
away
and
was
intend-
ing
to
go
away
the
next
day
,
after
inspecting
the
establishment
,
hearing
requests
from
the
peasants
and
verifying
all
the
business
records
.
``
That
's
enough
,
''
he
said
,
raising
his
head
,
''
I
am
tired
.
You
can
go
now
,
''
he
added
,
ad-
dressing
the
village
elder
,
``
Come
early
to-mor-
row
,
and
tell
the
peasants
in
the
morning
to
come
here
in
a
body
;
do
you
hear
?
''
l8
A
Oui
t
backwater
''
Yes
,
sir
.
''
``
And
tell
the
rural
clerk
to
bring
me
his
re-
port
for
the
last
month
.
You
did
well
to
white-
wash
the
walls
,
though
,
''
the
gentleman
added
,
looking
round
.
``
It
makes
it
look
cleaner
,
any-
way
.
''
The
village
elder
,
too
,
looked
round
the
walls
without
speaking
.
``
Well
,
now
go
.
''
The
village
elder
bowed
and
went
out
.
The
gentleman
stretched
.
``
Hey
!
''
he
cried
,
``
bring
in
tea
it
's
bedtime
!
''
The
servant
went
into
the
other
room
and
soon
returned
with
a
glass
of
tea
,
a
string
of
shop-made
bread
rings
and
a
little
jug
of
cream
on
a
tray
.
The
young
man
began
upon
his
tea
but
had
not
sipped
his
glass
twice
when
there
was
the
sound
of
visitors
coming
into
the
ad-
joining
room
and
a
squeaky
voice
asked
:
''
Is
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Astahov
at
home
?
Can
we
see
him
?
''
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
(
this
was
the
name
of
the
young
man
in
the
overcoat
)
looked
at
his
servant
in
perplexity
and
said
in
a
hurried
whis-
per
:
``
Go
and
find
out
who
it
is
.
''
The
tvvo
friends
and
other
stories
The
servant
went
out
,
carefully
closing
be-
hind
him
the
door
which
did
not
shut
properly
.
``
Tell
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
''
the
same
squeaky
voice
went
on
,
``
that
his
neighbour
,
Ipatov
,
wants
to
see
him
,
if
it
is
not
disturbing
him
;
and
that
another
neighbour
,
Ivan
Ilyitch
Bodry-
akov
,
has
come
with
me
;
he
too
wishes
to
pay
his
respects
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
made
an
involuntary
ges-
ture
of
annoyance
.
When
the
servant
came
into
the
room
,
however
,
he
said
to
him
:
''
Ask
them
in
.
''
And
he
stood
up
in
expectation
of
his
visitors
.
The
door
opened
and
the
visitors
came
in
.
One
of
them
,
a
thick-set
,
grey-headed
old
gen-
tleman
with
a
little
round
head
and
light-col-
oured
eyes
led
the
way
;
the
other
,
a
tall
,
lean
man
of
thirty-five
with
a
long
,
swarthy
face
and
hair
in
disorder
,
followed
,
swaying
from
one
foot
to
the
other
.
The
old
gentleman
was
wearing
a
neat
grey
frock-coat
with
big
pearl
buttons
;
a
pink
cravat
,
half
hidden
by
the
turned-down
collar
of
his
white
shirt
,
was
loosely
swathed
round
his
neck
;
his
legs
were
adorned
with
gaiters
,
his
plaid
trousers
were
of
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
an
agreeable
check
and
altogether
he
made
an
agreeable
impression
.
His
companion
,
on
the
other
hand
,
produced
a
less
favourable
effect
on
the
spectator
;
he
wore
an
old
black
swallow*
tail
coat
closely
buttoned
up
;
the
colour
of
his
thick
winter
trousers
was
in
keeping
with
his
coat
;
there
was
no
sign
of
linen
at
his
neck
or
his
wrists
.
The
old
man
first
went
up
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
and
,
bowing
politely
,
said
in
the
same
high
voice
:
''
I
have
the
honour
to
introduce
myself
:
your
nearest
neighbour
and
your
kinsman
,
indeed
,
Mihail
Nikolaitch
Ipatov
.
I
have
long
desired
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
.
I
hope
I
am
not
disturbing
you
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
answered
that
he
was
de-
lighted
and
that
he
,
too
,
desired
.
.
.
and
that
their
visit
was
not
disturbing
him
in
the
least
.
.
.
and
would
they
not
sit
down
and
have
tea
?
``
And
this
gentleman
,
''
continued
the
old
man
,
listening
with
a
cordial
smile
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
unfinished
sentences
and
indicating
the
gentleman
in
the
swallowtail
,
``
is
also
a
neighbour
of
yours
and
a
good
friend
of
mine
,
Ivan
Ilyitch
.
He
is
extremely
desirous
to
make
your
acquaintance
.
''
The
gentleman
in
the
swallowtail
from
whose
countenance
no
one
would
have
supposed
that
he
was
capable
of
being
extremely
desir-
ous
of
anything
so
absent-minded
and
at
the
same
time
drowsy
was
its
expression
the
gen-
tleman
in
the
swallowtail
bowed
listlessly
and
awkwardly
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
bowed
in
re-
sponse
to
him
and
again
begged
his
visitors
to
sit
down
.
They
did
so
.
``
I
am
delighted
,
''
the
old
man
began
with
an
agreeable
flourish
of
his
hands
while
his
com-
panion
fell
to
gazing
at
the
ceiling
v/ith
his
mouth
a
little
open
,
``
delighted
to
have
the
hon-
our
at
last
of
seeing
you
in
person
.
Although
you
reside
permanently
in
a
district
som.ewhat
remote
from
these
parts
,
yet
we
reckon
you
so
to
say
as
properly
belonging
to
our
neigh-
bourhood
.
''
``
That
's
very
flattering
to
me
,
''
replied
Vladi-
mir
Sergeitch
.
``
Whether
flattering
or
not
,
it
's
the
truth
.
You
must
excuse
me
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
we
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
are
straightforward
people
here
in
the
X.
dis-
trict
,
plain
in
our
ways
;
we
say
what
we
think
without
beating
about
the
bush
.
Even
on
name-
days
we
do
n't
put
on
dress-coats
to
visit
each
other
.
Really
!
That
is
the
established
custom
with
us
.
In
the
neighbouring
districts
they
call
us
'the
frock-coats
'
on
account
of
that
and
re-
proach
us
with
it
as
lack
of
breeding
,
but
we
do
n't
pay
any
attention
to
that
!
Upon
my
word
,
to
live
in
the
country
and
stand
on
cere-
mony
like
that
!
''
``
To
be
sure
,
what
can
be
better
in
the
coun-
try
than
simplicity
of
manners
?
''
observed
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
And
yet
,
''
the
old
gentleman
continued
,
``
in
our
district
,
too
,
there
are
most
intellectual
peo-
ple
,
people
of
European
education
though
they
do
n't
wear
dress-coats
.
For
instance
,
there
is
our
historian
,
Stcpan
Stepanitch
Yevsyukov
:
he
is
studying
Russian
history
from
the
most
ancient
times
and
his
name
is
known
in
Peters-
burg
,
a
very
learned
man
.
In
our
town
there
is
an
ancient
Swedish
cannon-ball
,
you
know
...
it
has
been
put
up
there
in
the
middle
of
the
square
...
it
was
he
discovered
it
,
you
know
.
Yes
,
indeed
!
Anton
Karlitch
Zenteler
,
now
...
he
has
studied
natural
history
;
though
indeed
they
say
all
Germans
succeed
in
that
subject
.
When
an
escaped
hyaena
was
killed
here
ten
years
ago
,
it
was
Anton
Karlitch
who
discovered
that
it
really
was
a
hysena
owing
to
the
peculiar
construction
of
its
tail
.
Then
there
's
Kaburdin
,
too
,
one
of
our
landowners
;
he
mostly
writes
light
articles
;
he
has
a
very
lively
pen
;
his
articles
come
out
in
the
Galatea

his

''
``
Sergeitch
,
''
Ivan
Ilyitch
prompted
him
.
``
Yes
,
Sergey
Sergeitch
his
hobby
is
poetry
.
Well
,
of
course
he
is
not
a
Pushkin
,
but
some-
times
he
is
as
smart
as
any
Petersburg
fellow
.
Do
you
know
his
epigram
on
Agey
Fomitch
?
''
``
What
Agey
Fomitch
?
''
``
Ah
,
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
am
always
for-
getting
that
you
are
not

here
,
after
all
.
He
is
our
Chief
of
Police
.
A
very
funny
epigram

was
.
Ivan

,
you
remember
it
,
do
n't
you
?
''
A

''
Agey
Fomitch
,
''
Bodryakov
began
indiffer-
ently
:
''
He
's
honoured
in
our
Nobles
'
Hall
Not
without
reason
for
,
in
brief
,
''
''
I
must
tell
you
,
''
Ipatov
interposed
,
``
that
he
was
elected
almost
unanimously
,
for
he
is
a
most
worthy
man
.
''
``
He
's
honoured
in
our
Nobles
'
Hall
Not
without
reason
for
,
in
brief
,
He
eats
and
drinks
to
beat
us
all
!
So
surely
he
's
a
first-rate
Chief
!
''
Bodryakov
repeated
.
The
old
gentleman
laughed
.
``
He
he
he
!
that
's
not
bad
,
is
it
?
Ever
since
would
you
believe
it
all
of
us
when
we
say
,
for
instance
,
good-day
to
Agey
Fomitch
,
are
sure
to
add
,
'Surely
he
's
a
first-rate
Chief
1'
And
do
you
imagine
that
Agey
Fomitch
is
vexed
at
it
?
Not
a
bit
.
No
that
is
not
the
way
with
us
.
Ask
Ivan
Ilyitch
here
.
''
Ivan
Ilyitch
merely
looked
away
.
``
Be
vexed
over
a
joke
,
how
could
one
!
Take
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
for
instance
:
his
nickname
among
us
is
the
Adjustable
Soul
because
he
very
readily
agrees
to
anything
.
Well
,
do
you
sup-
pose
Ivan
Ilyitch
resents
it
?
Not
he
!
''
Ivan
Ilyitch
looked
,
slowly
blinking
,
first
at
the
old
gentleman
and
then
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
The
nickname
of
the
Adjustable
Soul
cer-
tainly
suited
Ivan
Ilyitch
.
There
was
not
a
trace
in
him
of
what
is
called
will
or
character
.
Anyone
could
take
him
wherever
he
chose
;
one
had
only
to
say
to
him
,
``
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
come
along
,
''
and
he
would
take
his
hat
and
come
;
but
if
someone
else
turned
up
and
said
,
``
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
do
n't
go
,
''
he
would
put
down
his
hat
and
stay
.
He
was
of
a
quiet
and
peace-loving
disposition
,
he
had
been
a
bachelor
all
his
life
,
he
did
not
play
cards
but
liked
sitting
by
the
players
and
gazing
into
their
faces
.
He
could
not
get
on
without
company
and
detested
soli-
tude
;
he
sank
into
depression
when
alone
;
how-
ever
,
that
happened
to
him
very
rarely
.
He
had
another
peculiarity
:
getting
up
early
in
the
morning
,
he
used
to
sing
in
a
subdued
voice
an
old
ballad
:
''
Once
upon
a
time
a
baron
Lived
a
simple
country
life
.
''
.
.
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Thanks
to
this
peculiarity
,
he
was
also
nick-
named
the
hawfinch
;
it
is
well
known
that
a
caged
hawfinch
sings
only
once
in
the
day
,
in
the
early
morning
.
Such
was
Ivan
Ilyitch
Bodryakov
.
The
conversation
between
Vladimir
Sergeitch
and
Ipatov
lasted
a
good
time
but
did
not
again
take
such
an
intellectual
turn
.
The
old
man
questioned
Vladimir
Sergeitch
about
his
es-
tate
,
about
his
forest
lands
and
other
holdings
,
about
the
improvements
he
had
made
or
was
intending
to
make
in
the
management
of
his
land
;
he
communicated
some
of
his
own
ob-
servations
;
he
advised
him
,
among
other
things
,
as
a
means
of
getting
rid
of
tussocks
in
his
meadows
,
to
scatter
oats
round
them
,
which
would
induce
the
pigs
to
dig
them
up
with
their
snouts
and
so
on
.
At
last
,
however
,
ob-
serving
that
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
eyes
were
al-
most
closing
and
that
even
his
speech
betrayed
a
certain
languor
and
incoherence
,
the
old
gen-
tleman
got
up
and
,
bowing
affably
,
announced
that
he
did
not
intend
to
intrude
upon
him
any
longer
but
that
he
hoped
to
have
the
pleasure
of
welcoming
him
to
dinner
no
later
than
the
following
day
.
``
And
to
my
village
,
''
he
added
,
``
I
wo
n't
say
any
child
but
I
make
bold
to
say
any
hen
or
any
peasant
woman
you
come
across
would
show
you
the
way
;
you
have
only
to
ask
for
Ipatovka
.
The
horses
will
get
there
of
them-
selves
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
replied
with
some
slight
hesitation
,
which
was
characteristic
of
him
,
however
,
that
he
would
try
to
come
.
.
.
that
if
nothing
prevented
him
.
.
.
.
``
Oh
,
no
,
we
shall
expect
you
for
certain
,
''
the
old
gentleman
interrupted
him
genially
and
he
pressed
his
hand
warmly
and
rapidly
went
out
of
the
room
,
half
turning
in
the
doorway
to
exclaim
,
``
without
ceremony
!
''
The
Adjustable
Soul
,
Bodryakov
,
bowed
mutely
and
vanished
after
his
companion
,
stumbling
over
the
threshold
.
After
seeing
his
unexpected
visitors
out
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
immediately
undressed
,
went
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Astahov
belonged
to
that
class
of
people
who
after
cautiously
testing
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
their
powers
in
two
or
three
different
careers
say
of
themselves
that
they
have
made
up
their
minds
to
look
at
life
from
a
practical
point
of
view
and
devote
their
leisure
to
increas-
ing
their
income
.
He
was
by
no
means
stupid
,
somewhat
stingy
and
very
reasonable
,
was
fond
of
reading
,
of
society
,
of
music
,
but
all
in
moderation
.
.
.
and
he
behaved
with
the
utmost
propriety
.
He
was
only
twenty-seven
.
Young
men
like
him
have
become
numerous
of
late
.
He
was
of
medium
height
,
with
a
good
figure
,
his
features
were
pleasing
but
small
;
their
expression
scarcely
ever
changed
,
there
was
always
the
same
cool
,
clear
look
in
his
eyes
,
only
occasionally
softened
by
a
slight
shade
of
melancholy
or
boredom
;
a
polite
smile
al-
ways
hovered
about
his
lips
.
He
had
splendid
hair
,
fair
,
silky
,
long
and
curly
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
reckoned
to
have
about
six
hun-
dred
serfs
on
good
land
,
and
he
had
thoughts
of
marrying
,
marrying
by
inclination
but
at
the
same
time
to
advantage
.
He
particularly
wanted
to
find
a
wife
with
good
connections
.
He
considered
that
he
needed
wider
connec-
tions
.
In
fact
,
he
deserved
the
title
of
a
``
gen-
tleman
''
a
word
which
has
lately
come
into
fashion
.
Getting
up
next
morning
as
usual
very
early
,
our
gentleman
set
to
work
and
did
his
busi-
ness
rather
well
,
which
is
more
than
one
can
say
of
all
practical
young
men
among
us
in
Russia
.
He
listened
patiently
to
the
confused
complaints
and
requests
of
the
peasants
,
sat-
isfied
them
as
far
as
he
could
,
went
into
the
quarrels
and
disputes
between
relations
,
talked
some
people
round
,
reproved
others
,
checked
the
rural
clerk
's
report
,
exposed
two
or
three
pieces
of
sharp
practice
on
the
part
of
the
village
elder
in
fact
,
he
settled
things
so
that
he
felt
satisfied
with
himself
,
and
the
peas-
ants
as
they
went
home
spoke
well
of
him
.
In
spite
of
what
he
had
said
to
Ipatov
the
night
before
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
made
up
his
mind
to
dine
at
home
and
had
even
ordered
his
travelling
cook
to
make
him
his
favourite
giblet
and
rice
soup
;
but
all
at
once
,
in
consequence
,
perhaps
,
of
the
satisfaction
which
he
had
been
feeling
since
the
morning
,
he
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
slapped
himself
on
the
forehead
and
with
a
certain
recklessness
exclaimed
,
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
''
Suppose
I
do
go
to
that
lively
old
gossip
!
''
No
sooner
said
than
done
;
half
an
hour
later
he
was
sitting
in
his
new
chaise
drawn
by
four
good
peasant
horses
,
driving
to
Ipatovka
,
which
was
reckoned
a
distance
of
eight
miles
by
an
excellent
road
.
CHAPTER
II
MiHAiL
NiKOLAiTCH
IPATOV
had
two
houscs
facing
each
other
on
opposite
sides
of
a
huge
pond
.
A
long
dam
planted
with
silver
poplars
bordered
this
pond
;
almost
on
a
level
with
the
dam
could
be
seen
the
red
roof
of
a
water-mill
.
Built
exactly
alike
,
painted
the
same
lilac
col-
our
,
the
little
houses
looked
as
though
they
were
glancing
at
one
another
with
the
shining
panes
of
their
clean
little
windows
across
the
broad
expanse
of
water
.
There
was
a
round
verandah
in
the
front
of
each
house
and
a
pointed
portico
rose
above
it
supported
by
four
closely
set
white
columns
.
There
was
an
old
park
all
round
the
pond
:
lime-trees
formed
ave-
nues
across
it
and
stood
in
close
groups
about
it
;
ancient
pines
with
pale-yellow
trunks
,
dark
oaks
,
splendid
ash-trees
lifted
their
solitary
high
crests
here
and
there
;
the
dense
foliage
of
over-
grown
lilacs
and
acacias
reached
the
very
walls
,
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
covering
all
but
the
front
of
each
house
,
from
which
winding
brick
paths
ran
down
the
slope
.
Bright
,
coloured
ducks
and
white
and
grey
geese
were
swimming
in
separate
flocks
over
the
shining
water
of
the
pond
;
it
was
never
covered
with
duckweed
,
thanks
to
the
numer-
ous
springs
which
rose
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
,
rocky
ravine
at
its
``
head
.
''
The
position
of
the
houses
was
fine
:
inviting
,
secluded
and
beautiful
.
In
one
of
the
little
houses
lived
Mihail
Niko-
laitch
himself
;
in
the
other
lived
his
mother
,
a
decrepit
old
lady
of
seventy
.
When
he
drove
on
to
the
dam
Vladimir
Sergeitch
did
not
know
to
which
house
to
go
.
He
looked
round
a
serf
boy
was
standing
,
barefoot
,
on
a
half-rotten
log
,
angling
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
called
to
him
.
``
Whom
do
you
want
,
the
old
mistress
or
the
young
master
?
''
asked
the
boy
,
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
float
.
``
What
mistress
?
''
answered
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
.
``
I
want
Mihail
Nikolaitch
.
''
``
Ah
,
the
young
master
!
Then
go
to
the
right
.
''
And
the
boy
pulled
up
his
line
and
-^rew
out
of
the
motionless
water
a
small
,
sil-
very
carp
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
to
the
right
.
Mihail
Nikolaitch
was
playing
draughts
with
the
Adjustable
Soul
when
Vladimir
Sergeitch's
arrival
was
announced
.
He
was
extremely
de-
lighted
,
jumped
up
from
his
easy-chair
,
ran
into
the
hall
and
in
the
hall
kissed
him
three
times
.
``
You
find
me
with
my
invariable
compan-
ion
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
''
said
the
talkative
old
gentleman
,
``
with
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
who
,
by
the
way
,
is
absolutely
enchanted
by
your
affability
(
Ivan
Ilyitch
looked
into
the
corner
and
said
noth-
ing
)
.
He
has
been
kind
enough
to
stay
and
play
draughts
with
me
while
all
my
young
peo-
ple
have
gone
into
the
park
;
but
I
will
send
for
them
at
once
.
''
``
But
why
trouble
them
.
.
.
''
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
was
beginning
.
``
Oh
,
dear
,
it
is
no
trouble
whatever
!
Hey
,
Vanka
,
make
haste
and
run
after
the
young
ladies
.
.
.
tell
them
a
visitor
has
come
.
And
how
do
you
like
the
place
;
it
is
not
bad
,
is
it
?
Kaburdin
wrote
a
poem
about
it
.
'Ipatovka
,
lovely
haven
'
is
how
it
begins
,
the
rest
is
very
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
nice
,
too
,
only
I
do
n't
remember
it
.
The
park
is
too
large
,
that
is
the
only
pity
:
beyond
my
means
.
And
these
two
houses
,
so
alike
,
as
perhaps
you
have
noticed
,
were
built
by
two
brothers
,
my
father
Nikolay
and
my
Uncle
Sergey
;
they
laid
out
the
park
,
too
;
they
were
paragons
of
friendship
.

Damon
and
.
.
.
there
,
I
have
forgotten
the
name
of
the
other
.
''
``
Pythion
,
''
observed
Ivan
Ilyitch
.
``
Come
,
is
that
it
?
Well
,
it
does
not
mat-
ter
.
(
At
home
the
old
gentleman
talked
in
a
much
more
free
and
easy
manner
.
)
As
you
are
,
I
daresay
,
aware
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
I
am
a
widower
;
I
have
lost
my
wife
;
my
elder
children
are
at
boarding
school
;
I
have
only
the
two
younger
ones
with
me
and
my
sister-in-
law
,
my
wife
's
sister
;
you
will
see
her
imme-
diately
.
But
why
am
I
offering
you
nothing
?
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
go
and
see
about
refreshments
,
my
dear
fellow
.
.
.
.
What
sort
of
vodka
do
you
prefer
,
may
I
ask
?
''
``
I
never
drink
anything
before
dinner
.
''
``
Upon
my
word
,
is
it
possible
!
However
,
as
you
please
.
A
guest
must
be
honoured
and
must
not
be
crossed
.
We
are
plain
people
,
you
know
.
We
live
here
,
I
make
bold
to
say
,
not
in
barbarous
rusticity
,
but
in
peace
and
quiet
,
a
solitary
nook
that
's
what
it
is
!
But
why
do
n't
you
sit
down
?
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
sat
down
,
still
holding
his
hat
.
``
Allow
me
to
relieve
you
,
''
said
Ipatov
,
and
,
with
punctilious
courtesy
taking
his
hat
away
from
him
,
he
put
it
in
the
corner
,
then
came
back
,
looked
into
his
guest
's
face
with
a
cor-
dial
smile
and
,
not
knowing
what
agreeable
speech
to
make
to
him
,
asked
him
in
the
most
genial
way
whether
he
liked
draughts
.
``
I
play
all
games
very
badly
,
''
answered
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
''
And
that
is
quite
right
on
your
part
,
''
an-
swered
Ipatov
,
``
but
draughts
is
hardly
a
game
,
but
rather
an
amusement
,
a
pastime
;
is
n't
it
,
Ivan
Ilyitch
?
''
Ivan
Ilyitch
looked
at
Ipatov
with
an
apa-
thetic
expression
which
seemed
to
say
,
``
The
devil
knows
which
it
is
a
game
or
an
amuse-
ment
''
;
but
after
a
brief
pause
he
brought
out
:
''
Yes
,
draughts
is
all
right
.
''
``
Chess
,
now
,
they
say
,
is
a
different
matter
,
''
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Ipatov
went
on
``
they
say
it
is
a
very
difficult
game
.
But
to
my
mind
.
.
.
ah
,
but
here
are
my
young
people
,
''
he
interrupted
himself
,
look-
ing
through
the
half-open
glass
door
that
led
into
the
park
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
got
up
,
turned
round
and
saw
first
two
little
girls
about
ten
years
old
in
pink
cotton
dresses
and
big
hats
running
nimbly
up
the
verandah
steps
;
not
far
behind
them
appeared
a
tall
,
plump
,
graceful
girl
of
twenty
,
wearing
a
dark
dress
.
They
all
came
into
the
room
;
the
little
girls
made
formal
curt-
seys
to
the
visitor
.
``
Let
me
introduce
my
little
daughters
,
''
said
the
old
gentleman
.
``
This
is
Katya
and
this
is
Nastya
,
and
this
is
my
sister-in-law
,
Marya
Pavlovna
,
whom
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
mentioning
to
you
already
.
I
hope
you
will
be
good
friends
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
bowed
to
Marya
Pav-
lovna
;
she
responded
with
a
hardly
perceptible
inclination
of
her
head
.
Marya
Pavlovna
had
a
large
,
open
knife
in
her
hand
;
her
thick
brown
hair
was
a
little
untidy
,
a
small
green
leaf
had
caught
in
it
,
a
tress
had
come
loose
from
the
comb
;
there
was
a
flush
on
her
dark
skin
,
her
red
lips
were
parted
;
her
dress
looked
crumpled
.
She
was
out
of
breath
,
her
eyes
were
shining
;
evidently
she
had
been
working
in
the
garden
.
She
went
out
of
the
room
at
once
and
the
little
girls
ran
after
her
.
``
To
smarten
themselves
up
a
little
,
''
ob-
served
the
old
gentleman
,
addressing
Vladimir
Sergeitch
;
``
they
must
think
of
that
,
of
course
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
smirked
in
response
and
grew
a
little
thoughtful
.
Marya
Pavlovna
had
made
an
impression
upon
him
.
It
was
many
years
since
he
had
seen
such
a
typical
beauty
of
the
Russian
steppes
.
She
soon
came
back
,
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
and
sat
without
mov-
ing
.
She
had
done
her
hair
,
but
she
had
not
changed
her
dress
and
had
not
even
put
on
cuffs
.
There
was
an
expression
on
her
face
not
so
much
of
pride
as
of
severity
almost
of
roughness
;
her
brow
was
broad
and
low
,
her
nose
was
short
and
straight
;
from
time
to
time
her
lips
curved
in
a
slow
,
languid
smile
;
there
was
;
a
scornful
frown
on
her
straight
brows
.
Nearly
all
the
time
she
kept
her
big
dark
eyes
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
cast
down
.
``
I
know
,
''
her
ungracious
young
face
seemed
to
be
saying
,
``
I
know
that
you
are
all
looking
at
me
;
well
,
look
;
you
weary
me
.
''
When
she
did
raise
her
eyes
,
there
was
some-
thing
wild
,
beautiful
and
unseeing
in
them
that
recalled
the
eyes
of
a
doe
.
She
was
beauti-
fully
proportioned
.
A
classical
poet
would
have
compared
her
to
Ceres
or
Juno
.
``
What
were
you
doing
in
the
garden
?
''
Ipatov
asked
,
trying
to
draw
her
into
the
con-
versation
.
``
I
was
cutting
off
the
dead
branches
and
ligging
the
flower-beds
,
''
she
said
in
a
rather
low
,
agreeable
and
resonant
voice
.
``
Well
,
and
are
you
tired
?
''
``
The
children
are
tired
;
I
am
not
.
''
``
I
know
,
''
said
the
old
man
with
a
smile
,
''
you
are
a
regular
Bobelina
!
And
have
you
been
in
to
Grandmamma
?
''
``
Yes
;
she
is
asleep
.
''
``
Are
you
fond
of
flowers
?
''
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
asked
her
.
``
Yes
.
''
``
Why
do
n't
you
put
your
hat
on
when
you
go
out
?
''
Ipatov
observed
to
her
;
``
see
how
red
and
sunburnt
you
are
.
''
She
passed
her
hand
over
her
face
and
said
nothing
.
Her
hands
were
not
large
but
rather
broad
and
red
.
She
did
not
wear
gloves
.
``
And
are
you
fond
of
gardening
?
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
asked
again
.
``
Yes
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
to
describe
a
beau-
tiful
garden
belonging
to
a
wealthy
landowner
in
his
neighbourhood
:
``
The
German
head
gar-
dener
alone
receives
a
salary
of
two
thousand
silver
roubles
,
''
he
observed
among
other
things
.
``
And
what
is
the
name
of
the
gardener
?
''
Ivan
Ilyitch
asked
suddenly
,
''
I
do
n't
remember
;
Meyer
or
Miller
,
I
be-
lieve
.
Why
do
you
ask
?
''
``
Oh
,
''
said
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
``
simply
to
know
his
surname
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
on
with
his
descrip-
tion
.
The
little
girls
,
Mihail
Nikolaitch's
daughters
,
came
in
,
quietly
sat
down
and
be-
gan
quietly
listening
.
A
servant
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
an-
nounced
that
Yegor
Kapitonitch
had
arrived
.
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
''
Ah
!
Ask
him
in
,
ask
him
in
!
''
cried
Ipatov
.
A
short
,
stout
old
gentleman
came
in
,
one
of
those
people
who
are
described
as
``
stubby
''
or
``
stumpy
,
''
with
a
puffy
and
at
the
same
time
wrinkled
face
that
recalled
a
baked
apple
.
He
had
on
a
grey
Hungarian
jacket
with
black
frogs
and
a
stand-up
collar
;
his
full
coffee-col-
oured
plush
breeches
ended
far
above
his
ankles
.
``
How
are
you
,
honoured
Yegor
Kapiton-
itch
!
''
exclaimed
Ipatov
,
going
to
meet
him
.
``
It
is
a
long
time
since
we
have
seen
you
.
''
``
But
Mihail
Nikolaitch
,
''
began
Yegor
Kapi-
tonitch
in
a
lisping
and
plaintive
voice
,
first
bowing
to
all
present
,
``
you
know
I
am
not
a
free
man
,
am
I
?
''
``
In
what
way
are
you
not
a
free
man
,
Yegor
Kapitonitch
?
''
``
Why
,
Mihail
Nikolaitch
,
my
family
,
things
to
see
to
.
.
.
.
And
then
there
is
Matryona
Markovna
.
''
And
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair
.
``
What
about
Matryona
Markovna
?
''
And
Ipatov
winked
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
as
though
wishing
to
secure
his
attention
.
``
Why
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Yegor
Kapltonitch
,
sitting
down
,
``
she
is
dissatisfied
with
me
,
as
though
you
did
n't
know
.
Whatever
I
say
it
is
ahvays
wrong
,
unrefined
,
improper
.
And
why
it
is
improper
,
God
only
knows
.
And
the
young
ladies
that
is
,
my
daughters
do
the
same
,
following
their
mother
's
example
.
I
am
not
saying
anything
against
her
,
of
course
;
Matryona
Markovna
is
an
excellent
woman
but
very
strict
about
manners
.
''
``
But
upon
my
word
,
Yegor
Kapitonitch
,
what
is
there
wrong
with
your
manners
?
''
``
That
's
just
what
I
think
myself
,
but
it
seems
she
is
hard
to
please
.
Yesterday
,
for
instance
,
I
said
at
table
,
'Matryona
Markovna
'
(
and
Yegor
Kapitonitch
put
a
most
ingratiating
in-
tonation
into
his
voice
)
,
'Matr
}
'ona
Markovna
,
*
I
said
,
'how
careless
Alyoshka
is
with
the
horses
!
He
does
not
know
how
to
drive
;
he
has
quite
knocked
up
the
black
stallion
!
'
And
dear
me
,
how
Matryona
Markovna
did
flare
iip
and
began
crying
shame
on
me
!
'You
don't
know
how
to
express
yourself
decently
in
la-
dies
'
society
,
'
she
said
;
the
young
ladies
jumped
up
and
left
the
table
at
once
,
and
next
day
the
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Biryulovsky
young
ladies
,
my
wife
's
nieces
,
knew
all
about
it
.
And
what
improper
expres-
sion
did
I
use
?
Judge
for
yourself
!
And
whatever
I
say
I
may
speak
a
little
incau-
tiously
sometimes
;
everyone
does
,
especially
at
home
the
Biryulovsky
young
ladies
know
all
about
it
next
day
.
I
simply
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
Sometimes
I
am
sitting
like
this
think-
ing
,
as
my
way
is
as
perhaps
you
are
aware
I
breathe
rather
heavily
,
and
Matryona
Mark-
ovna
scolds
me
again
'Do
n't
snuffle
,
'
she
says
,
'nobody
snuffles
nowadays
!
'
'Why
are
you
scolding
,
Matryona
Markovna
?
'
I
say
;
'you
ought
to
be
sorry
for
me
,
and
you
are
scolding
.
'
Well
,
I
have
had
to
give
up
thinking
at
home
.
I
sit
and
simply
look
at
the
floor
like
this
,
yes
,
indeed
.
And
the
other
day
we
were
going
to
bed
.
'Matryona
Markovna
,
'
I
said
,
'it
's
dread-
ful
how
you
spoil
your
page
,
my
dear
;
he
is
such
a
little
pig
,
'
said
I
,
'he
might
wash
his
face
on
Sunday
,
anyway
.
'
Well
,
I
hinted
it
deli-
cately
enough
,
I
should
have
thought
,
but
I
did
not
please
her
this
time
,
either
;
Matryona
Markovna
began
putting
me
to
shame
again
.
'You
do
not
know
how
to
behave
in
the
com-
pany
of
a
lady
,
'
said
she
,
and
next
day
the
Biryulovsky
young
ladies
knew
all
about
it
.
So
how
can
I
have
the
heart
to
go
out
paying
visits
,
Mihail
Nikolaitch
?
''
``
I
am
astonished
at
what
you
tell
me
,
''
re-
plied
Ipatov
;
``
I
should
never
have
expected
this
of
Matryona
Markovna
;
I
should
have
thought
she
was
.
.
.
''
``
The
best
of
women
,
''
Yegor
Kapitonitch
caught
him
up
,
``
an
exemplary
wife
and
mother
,
one
may
say
,
but
strict
on
the
point
of
man-
ners
.
She
says
that
in
everything
,
what
is
needed
is
ensemble
and
that
I
have
not
got
that
.
I
do
n't
speak
French
,
as
you
know
,
I
only
un-
derstand
it
.
But
what
is
this
ensemble
which
I
am
lacking
in
?
''
Ipatov
,
who
was
not
very
great
at
French
himself
,
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
And
how
are
your
children
,
your
sons
,
that
is
?
''
he
asked
Yegor
Kapitonitch
after
a
brief
pause
.
Yegor
Kapitonitch
looked
at
him
sideways
.
``
My
sons
?
They
are
all
right
.
I
am
pleased
with
them
.
The
young
ladies
have
got
out
of
hand
,
but
I
am
satisfied
with
my
sons
.
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Alyoshka
is
doing
well
in
the
service
,
his
su-
periors
praise
him
;
my
Alyoshka
is
a
shrewd
lad
.
Mihets
is
different
;
he
has
turned
out
a
sort
of
a
philanthropist
.
''
``
Why
a
philanthropist
?
''
'
'Goodness
knows
;
never
speaks
to
anyone
,
fights
shy
of
us
all
.
Matryona
Markovna
only
makes
him
worse
.
'Why
do
you
follow
your
father
's
example
?
'
she
says
.
You
should
respect
him
,
but
you
should
imitate
your
moth-
er
's
manners
.
'
When
he
is
grown
up
,
he
will
get
on
too
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
asked
Ipatov
to
intro
duce
him
to
Yegor
Kapitonitch
.
A
conversa-
tion
followed
.
Marya
Pavlovna
took
no
part
in
it
;
Ivan
Ilyitch
sat
down
beside
her
,
but
he
only
said
two
words
to
her
;
the
little
girls
went
up
to
him
and
began
telling
him
some-
thing
in
a
whisper
.
.
.
.
The
housekeeper
,
a
thin
old
woman
with
a
dark
kerchief
on
her
head
,
came
in
and
announced
that
dinner
was
ready
.
They
all
went
into
the
dining-room
.
Dinner
lasted
rather
a
long
time
.
Ipatov
kept
a
good
cook
and
had
good
wine
,
though
it
did
not
come
from
Moscow
but
from
the
town
of
the
province
.
Ipatov
lived
in
com-
fort
;
he
had
no
more
than
three
hundred
serfs
but
he
was
in
debt
to
no
one
and
his
estate
was
in
good
order
.
The
master
of
the
house
himself
did
most
of
the
talking
at
dinner
.
Yegor
Kapitonitch
seconded
him
but
did
not
forget
to
look
after
himself
:
he
ate
and
drank
in
fine
style
.
Marya
Pavlovna
was
silent
,
only
answering
with
a
half
smile
the
hurried
say-
ings
of
the
two
little
girls
sitting
one
on
each
side
of
her
;
they
seemed
to
be
very
fond
of
her
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
attempted
several
times
to
talk
to
her
but
with
no
great
success
.
The
Adjustable
Soul
,
Bodryakov
,
was
sloth-
ful
and
apathetic
even
in
his
eating
.
After
dinner
they
all
went
on
to
the
veran-
dah
to
drink
coffee
.
The
weather
was
lovely
;
the
sweet
fragrance
of
lime-trees
in
full
flower
was
wafted
from
the
park
;
the
summer
air
,
slightly
freshened
by
the
thick
shade
of
the
trees
and
the
dampness
of
the
pond
close
by
,
was
full
of
caressing
warmth
.
All
at
once
from
beyond
the
poplars
of
the
dam
came
the
sound
of
scurrying
horses
'
hoofs
and
a
moment
later
a
lady
wearing
a
long
rid-
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
ing
habit
and
a
round
grey
hat
came
into
sight
mounted
on
a
bay
horse
;
she
was
riding
at
a
gallop
;
a
page
rode
behind
on
a
small
white
cob
.
``
Ah
!
''
cried
Ipatov
,
``
here
is
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
what
a
pleasant
surprise
!
''
``
Alone
?
''
asked
Marya
Pavlovna
,
who
had
till
that
moment
stood
motionless
by
the
door
.
``
Yes
,
alone
...
I
suppose
something
has
detained
Pyotr
Alexeitch
.
''
Marya
Pavlovna
looked
up
from
under
her
brows
;
her
face
was
suffused
with
colour
,
and
she
turned
away
.
Meanwhile
the
lady
on
horseback
rode
through
the
little
gate
into
the
garden
,
galloped
up
to
the
terrace
and
leapt
lightly
to
the
ground
without
waiting
for
her
page
or
Ipatov
,
who
was
coming
to
meet
her
.
Dexterously
picking
up
the
hem
of
her
long
skirt
,
she
ran
up
the
steps
and
,
as
she
landed
on
the
verandah
,
she
called
gaily
:
''
Here
I
am
!
''
``
You
are
very
welcome
!
''
said
Ipatov
.
``
How
unexpected
!
How
delightful
!
Allow
me
to
kiss
your
hand
.
''
``
Certainly
,
''
replied
the
visitor
,
``
only
pull
off
my
glove
yourself
;
I
ca
n't
do
it
.
''
And
stretching
out
her
hand
to
him
,
she
nodded
to
Marya
Pavlovna
.
``
Masha
,
only
fancy
,
my
brother
wo
n't
be
here
to-day
,
''
she
said
with
a
faint
sigh
.
``
I
see
that
he
is
not
here
,
''
Marya
Pavlovna
answered
in
an
undertone
.
``
He
told
me
to
tell
you
that
he
is
busy
.
Do
n't
be
angry
.
Good
afternoon
,
Yegor
Kapi-
tonitch
,
good
afternoon
,
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
good
af-
ternoon
,
children

,
''
said
the
vis-
itor
,
addressing
her
page
,
``
tell
them
to
walk
Beauty
up
and
down
a
little
;
do
you
hear
?
Masha
,
give
me
a
pin
,
please
,
to
fasten
up
my
train
.
.
.
.
Mihail
Nikolaitch
,
come
here
.
''
Ipatov
went
nearer
to
her
.
``
Who
is
that
new
person
?
''
she
asked
in
a
fairly
loud
voice
.
``
A
neighbour
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Astahov
,
you
know
,
the
owner
of
Sasovo
.
Shall
I
introduce
him
?
''
``
Very
well
.
.
,
presently
.
Oh
,
what
lovely
weather
,
''
she
went
on
.
``
Yegor
Kapitonitch
,
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
tell
me
,
does
Matryona
Markovna
scold
even
in
weather
like
this
?
''
``
Matryona
I\Iarkovna
does
not
scold
in
any
weather
,
Madam
;
she
is
only
strict
about
man-
ners
.
''
``
And
what
are
the
Biryulovsky
young
ladies
doing
?
They
know
everything
next
day
,
don't
they
?
''
And
she
broke
into
a
ringing
,
silvery
laugh
.
``
You
are
always
pleased
to
laugh
,
''
said
Yegor
Kapitonitch
.
``
But
when
should
one
laugh
if
not
at
your
age
?
''
``
Yegor
Kapitonitch
,
do
n't
be
angry
,
there's
a
dear
!
Oh
,
I
am
tired
,
let
me
sit
down
.
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
sank
into
a
low
chair
and
roguishly
pulled
her
hat
right
down
to
her
eyes
.
Ipatov
brought
Vladimir
Sergeitch
up
to
her
.
``
Allow
me
,
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
,
to
pre-
sent
to
you
our
neighbour
,
Monsieur
Astahov
,
of
whom
you
have
probably
heard
a
great
deal
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
bowed
and
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
looked
up
at
him
from
under
the
brim
of
her
round
hat
.
``
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
Veretyev
is
our
neighbour
,
''
Ipatov
went
on
,
addressing
Vladi-
mir
Sergeitch
.
``
She
lives
here
with
her
brother
,
Pyotr
Alexeitch
,
formerly
a
lieutenant
in
the
Guards
.
She
is
a
great
friend
of
my
sis-
ter-in-law
and
is
agreeably
disposed
to
us
all
.
''
``
A
full
and
complete
description
,
''
said
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
with
a
mocking
smile
,
looking
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
from
under
her
hat
again
.
And
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
thinking
mean-
while
,
``
She
is
very
pretty
,
too
.
''
And
cer-
tainly
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
was
a
very
charm-
ing
girl
slim
and
graceful
,
she
looked
much
younger
than
she
was
.
She
was
twenty-seven
.
She
had
a
round
face
and
a
little
head
,
fluffy
,
fair
hair
,
a
sharp
,
almost
saucily
turned-up
nose
,
and
gay
,
rather
sly
eyes
.
Her
eyes
fairly
gleamed
and
flashed
with
mockery
.
Her
ex-
tremely
lively
and
mobile
features
wore
at
times
an
amusing
expression
;
they
seemed
to
be
alive
with
humour
.
From
time
to
time
,
as
a
rule
quite
suddenly
,
a
shade
of
pensiveness
would
pass
over
her
face
,
and
then
it
became
gentle
and
good-natured
;
but
she
could
not
be
A
OUIET
BACKWATER
thoughtful
for
long
.
She
readily
detected
the
comic
side
of
people
and
drew
rather
good
caricatures
.
From
her
birth
upwards
she
had
been
spoiled
by
everyone
and
that
could
be
seen
from
the
first
moment
:
people
who
have
been
spoiled
in
their
childhood
retain
a
certain
stamp
all
their
lives
.
Her
brother
was
fond
of
her
,
though
he
did
declare
that
she
stung
not
like
a
bee
but
like
a
wasp
,
since
the
bee
dies
when
it
stings
,
while
stinging
means
noth-
ing
to
the
wasp
.
This
comparison
vexed
her
.
``
Are
you
staying
here
long
?
''
she
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
dropping
her
eyes
and
twisting
her
riding
whip
in
her
hands
.
``
No
,
I
propose
going
away
to-morrow
.
''
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
``
Home
.
''
``
Home
?
Why
,
may
I
venture
to
ask
?
''
``
Why
?
I
have
business
at
home
that
ad-
mits
of
no
delay
.
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
looked
at
him
.
``
Are
you
such
a
.
.
.
business-like
person
?
''
``
I
try
to
be
business-like
,
''
replied
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
In
our
practical
age
every
decent
person
ought
to
be
practical
and
business-like
.
''
THE
two
FRIENBS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
''
That
is
perfectly
true
,
''
observed
Ipatov
.
``
Is
n't
it
,
Ivan
llyitch
?
''
Ivan
llyitch
simply
glanced
at
Ipatov
,
while
Yegor
Kapitonitch
commented
:
''
Yes
,
that
is
so
.
''
``
It
is
a
pity
,
''
said
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
,
''
a
jeune
premier
is
just
what
we
are
short
of
.
You
can
act
comedy
,
ca
n't
you
?
''
``
I
have
never
tried
my
powers
in
that
line
.
''
``
I
am
sure
you
would
act
well
.
You
have
such
a
.

.
dignified
deportment
;
that
's
essen-
tial
for
a
jeune
premier
of
to-day
.
My
brother
and
I
are
thinking
of
setting
up
a
dramatic
society
here
.
But
we
shall
not
con-
fine
ourselves
to
comedies
;
we
shall
act
every-

dramas
,
ballets
and
even
tragedies
.
Would
n't
Masha
make
a
fine
Cleopatra
or
Phaedra
?
Look
at
her
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
turned
round
.
.
.
.
Lean-
ing
with
her
head
against
the
door
,
Marya
Pav-
lovna
was
standing
with
her
arms
folded
,
gaz-
ing
dreamily
into
the
distance
.
.
.
.
Certainly
at
that
moment
her
harmonious
features
were
suggestive
of
antique
sculpture
.
She
had
not
A
QUIET
jSACKWATER
heard
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
's
last
words
but
,
noticing
that
all
eyes
were
suddenly
turned
upon
her
,
she
immediately
guessed
what
was
being
said
,
flushed
crimson
and
was
on
the
point
of
retreating
into
the
drawing-room
.
.
.
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
quickly
seized
her
by
the
hand
and
with
the
coquettish
tenderness
of
a
kitten
drew
the
almost
masculine-looking
hand
to
her
and
kissed
it
.
Marya
Pavlcvna
flushed
a
deeper
colour
.
``
You
are
always
full
of
mischief
,
Nadya
,
''
she
said
.
``
Did
n't
I
tell
the
truth
about
you
?
I
ap-
peal
to
you
all
.
.
.
.
Well
,
there
,
there
,
I'll
stop
.
But
I
tell
you
again
,
''
Nadyezhda
Alex-
yevna
went
on
,
addressing
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
''
it
is
a
pity
you
are
going
away
.
It
is
true
we
have
got
a
jeune
pre\mier
;
he
forces
him-
self
upon
us
,
indeed
,
but
he
is
a
very
poor
one
.
''
``
Who
is
that
,
may
I
ask
?
''
``
Bodryakov
,
the
poet
.
How
can
a
poet
be
a
jcune
premier
!
In
the
first
place
he
dresses
horribly
;
in
the
second
,
though
he
writes
epi-
grams
,
in
the
presence
of
any
woman
,
even
of
me
,
imagine
,
he
is
overcome
with
shyness
.
He
lisps
,
always
holds
one
arm
above
his
head
and
I
do
n't
know
what
he
does
n't
do
.
Tell
me
,
please
,
Monsieur
Astahov
,
are
all
poets
like
that
?
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
drew
himself
up
a
little
.
``
I
have
never
known
one
personally
and
I
must
confess
I
have
never
sought
their
ac-
quaintance

``
Yes

of
course
,
you
are

We
shall
have
to
take
Bodryakov

there

no
help
for
it

The
other
jeunes
premiers
are
even
worse

He
would
learn
his
part

any-

In
addition
to
the
tragic
parts
Masha
will
be
our
prima-donna

.
.
.
Have
you
heard
her
sing

Monsieur
Astahov
?
''
``
No
,
''
replied
Vladimir
Sergeitch
with
a
smirk
,
``
I
did
n't
know

.
.
''
.
``
What
is
the
matter
with
you
to-day

Nadya

said
Marya
Pavlovna
with
an
air
of
vexation
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
jumped
up
.
``

Marya
Pavlovna
did
not
speak
for
a
minute
.
``
There
's
no
putting

off

she
said
at
last
.
``

cried
Nadyezhda

she
clapped
her
hands

us
go
into
the
drawing-room

As
for
having
my
own
way
,
I
'll
score
that
against

she
added
,
laughing
.
``
How
can
you
expose
my
weaknesses
before
strangers

Yegor
Kapiton-

is
that
how
Matryona
Markovna
puts
you
to
shame
before

``
Matryona
Markovna

muttered
Yegor
Kapitonitch
,
``

a

estimable

only
on

``
Well

come
along

come
along

Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
interrupted
him
,
and
she
went
into
the
drawing-room
.
Everyone
followed
her
.
She
flung
down
her
hat
and
sat
down
at
the
piano
.
Marya
Pavlovna
stood
by
the
wall
,
at
some
distance
from
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
.
``
Masha

''
she
said
after
a
moment
's
thought

]
\Iarya
Pavlovna
began
singing
.
Her
voice
was
pure
and
strong
and
she
sang
well
sim-
ply
and
naturally
.
Everyone
listened
to
her
with
great
attention
and
Vladimir
Sergeitch
could
not
conceal
his
astonishment
.
When
Marya
Pavlovna
had
finished
he
went
up
to
her
and
began
declaring
that
he
had
had
no
idea
.
.
.
``
Wait
a
bit
,
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
inter-
rupted
him
,
``
there
's
better
to
come
!
Masha
,
I
will
comfort
your
Little
Russian
heart

us
now

Uproar

Oakwood

Are
you

Little
Russian

Vladimir
Serge-
itch
asked
her
.
``
I
was
born
in
Little
Russia
,
''
she
answered
,
and
she
began
singing
the
``
Merry
Uproar
.
''
At
first
she
articulated
the
words
indiffer-
ently
,
but
the
mournfully
,
passionate
tune
of
her
native
land
by
degrees
roused
her
,
her
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
cheeks
flushed
,
her
eyes
shone
,
there
was
a
warm
ring
in
her
voice
.
She
finished
,
``
'
''
Good
heavens
,
how
well
you
sang
that
!
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
commented
,
bending
over
the
keys
.
``
What
a
pity
my
brother
is
not
here
!
''
Marya
Pavlovna
dropped
her
eyes
at
once
and
her
characteristic
bitter
smile
came
on
to
her
lips
.
``
And
now
we
must
have
something
more
,
''
observed
Ipatov
.
``
Yes
,
if
you
would
be
so
good
,
''
added
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
Excuse
me
,
I
wo
n't
sing
any
more
to-night

''
said
Marya
Pavlovna
,
and
she
walked
away
from
the
piano
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
looked
after
her
,
seemed
thoughtful
for
a
minute
,
then
smiled
,
began
playing
with
one
finger
``
The
Peasant
Lad
the
Wheat
Is
Sowing
,
''
then
suddenly
broke
into
a
brilliant
polka
and
without
finishing
it
,
struck
a
loud
chord
,
shut
the
piano
and
got
up
.
``
It
is
a
pity
there
's
no
one
to
dance
with

she
exclaimed
.
``
That
would
have
been
just
the
thing

TME
TWO
FRIfiNBS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
up
to
her
.
``
What
a
wonderful
voice
Marya
Pavlovna
has
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
with
what
feeling
she
sings
!
''
``
Are
you
fond
of
music
?
''
``
Yes

``
Such
a

Why
do
you
suppose
that
I
am

``
Oh
,
yes

I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
was
forget-
ting
you
are

practical
man

Where
is
Masha
gone
?
Wait
,
I
'll
go
and
fetch
her
.
''
And
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
fluttered
out
of
the
room
.
``
Giddy
head
,
as
you
see
,
''
said
Ipatov
,
going
up
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
``
but
a
very
good
heart
.
And
what
an
education
she
has
had
,
you
can
not
fancy
:
she
can
speak
in
every
lan-
guage

Of
course
they
are
people
of
property
,
so
no
wonder

^
''
Yes

Vladimir
Sergeitch
acquiesced
ab-
sent-mindedly
,
``
very
charming
young
lady
.
But
tell
me
,
was
your
wife
also
from
Little
Russia
?
''
``
Yes
.
My
wife
was
a
Little
Russian
like
her
sister
Marya
Pavlovna
.
To
tell
the
truth
,
my
wife
's
accent
was
not
perfect
;
though
she
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
knew
the
Russian
language
perfectly
,
she
did
not
pronounce
it
correctly
;
her
vowel
sounds
were
not
quite
pure
;
Marya
Pavlovna
now
left
her
own
country
when
she
was
little
.
Yet
one
can
see
the
Little
Russian
blood
,
can't

''
Marya
Pavlovna
sings
wonderfully
,
''
ob-
served
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
Yes
,
she
does
sing
well
.
But
why
is
it
they
do
n't
bring
in
the
tea
?
And
what
has
be-
come
of
the
young
ladies
?
It
is
tea-time
.
''
The
young
ladies
did
not
return
for
some
time
.
Meanwhile
the
samovar
was
brought
in
and
the
table
was
set
for
tea
Ipatov
sent
for
them
.
They
came
back
together
.
Marya
Pav-
lovna
sat
down
at
the
table
to
pour
out
tea
,
while
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
went
to
the
door
of
the
verandah
and
looked
out
into
the
gar-
den
.
The
bright
summer
day
was
followed
by
a
soft
,
clear
evening
;
there
was
the
glow
of
sunset
;
the
broad
pond
,
half
flooded
with
its
crimson
light
,
stood
a
motionless
mirror
,
with
stately
serenity
reflecting
in
the
silvery
darkness
of
its
deep
bosom
all
ihe
fathomless
ethereal
sky
and
the
black
shapes
of
the
trees
upside
down
and
the
house
.
Everything
had
sunk
into
silence
;
there
was
not
a
sound
anywhere
.
``
Look
how
beautiful
,
''
said
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
as
he
came
up
to
her
.
``
Out
there
in
the
pond
a
star
has
just
come
out
,
beside
the
lights
of
the
house
;
they
are
red
but
it
is
golden
.
Here
is
Grand-
mamma
coming
,
''
she
added
.
A
bath-chair
came
into
view
from
behind
the
lilac
bushes
.
Two
men
were
drawing
it
.
The
bent
figure
of
an
old
lady
with
her
head
bowed
on
her
breast
was
sitting
muffled
up
in
it
.
The
fringe
of
her
white
cap
almost
completely
cov-
ered
her
withered
and
shrunken
face
.
The
bath-chair
stopped
before
the
verandah
.
Ipa-
tov
went
out
of
the
drawing-room
;
his
little
daughters
ran
out
after
him
.
They
had
been
scurrying
from
room
to
room
like
mice
all
the
evening
.
``
I
wish
you
good-evening
,
mother
,
''
said
Ipatov
,
going
up
to
the
old
lady
and
raising
his
voice
.
``
How
do
you
feel
?
''
``
I
have
come
to
have
a
look
at
you
,
''
the
old
lady
enunciated
with
an
efifort
,
in
a
tone-
less
voice
.
``
What
a
lovely
evening
!
I
have
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
been
asleep
all
day
and
now
my
legs
are
ach-
ing

Ah
,
my
legs
!
They
are
no

they
ache

``
Allow
me
to
present
to
you
,

,
our
neighbour
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Astahov

''
``
Delighted
,
''
said
the
old
lady
,
turning
upon
him
her
big
,
black
,
lustreless
eyes
.
``
I
hope
you
will
be
friends
with
my
son

He
is
a
good
man
;
I
gave
him
all
the
education
I
could
;
of
course
I
am
only
a
woman
.
He
is
a
bit
weak
yet
,
but
with
time
he
will
grow
steadier
,
it's
high
time
he
did
;
it
's
time
for
me
to
hand
things
over
to
him

Is
that
you
,
Nadya
?

shf
added
,
looking
at
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
.
``
Yes

``
And
is
Masha
pouring
out
tea

``

``

Markovna

``

The
old
lady
chewed
her
lips
.
``

she
added
,
addressing
Vladimir
Sergeitch
;
``
you
must
forgive
an
old
woman

And
do
n't
come
with
me

no

All
you
think
of
is
to
be
running
about

Sit
still

sit
still
and
learn
your

do
you
hear

Masha

Come

set
off

''
The
old
lady
's
head
,
raised
with
difficulty
,
sank
back
upon
her
breast
.
The
bath-chair
started
and
moved
slowly
away
.
``
How
old
is
your
mother
?
''
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
She
is
only
seventy-two
but
she
lost
the
use
of
her
legs
twenty-six
years
ago
;
it
hap-
pened
to
her
soon
after
my
father
's
death
.
But
she
was
a
beauty

Everyone
was
silent
.
All
at
once
Nadyezhda
Alexycvna
started
.
``
What
's
that
?
I
believe
it
was
a
bat
!
Oh
,
how
horrid
!

And
she
went
hurriedly
back
into
the
.
drawing-room

A
QUIET
BACKWATER

It
is

``
It

Vladimir
Sergeitch

``
Why
should

Ipatov

Nadyezhda
Alexyevna

Nadyezhda

Wait

be
lighter
riding
then

``
Perhaps

replied
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
;
''
it
is
a
long
time
since
I
have
been
for
a
ride
by

And
will

Ipatov

``
Not

I
assure

win
bid

``
It
is
nice
riding
by
moonlight

began
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
,
as
soon
as
they
had
brought
the
candles
and
handed
the
tea
and
Ipatov
and
Yegor
Kapitonitch
had
sat
down
to
a
game
of
two-handed
preference
and
the
Adjustable
Soul
had
installed
himself
beside
them
without
uttering
a
word
,
``
especially
through
woods
,
between
the
nut
bushes

It's
uncanny
and
delightful
and
there
is
a
strange
play
of
light
and
shadow
one
feels
as
though
someone
were
lurking
behind
or
in
front

Vladimir
Sergeitch
gave
a
condescending
smile
.
``
And
has
it
happened

,
''
she
went
on
,
''
to
sit
on
a
warm
,
dark
,
still
night
near
a
wood
?
It
always
seems
to
me
then
as
though
two
voices
were
arguing
hotly
in
a
faint
whisper
behind
me
close
to
my
ear

``
That
's
the

Ipatov

``
Your

Vladimir

Nadyezhda

looked
at

``
Why
so

Marya

``
No

false

``
What
a

exclaimed
A

``
Well

there
it

you

``
On
the

I
am

musical

shall
I
say

when

presents
ideas

Marya
Pavlovna
got
up
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
turned
quickly
to
her
.
``
Where
are
you
going

``
To

nine
o'clock

go
to

But
Marya
Pavlovna
took
the
children
by
their
hands
and
went
out
with
them
.
``
She
is
in
a
bad
mood
to-day

observed
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
,
``
and
I
know
why

she
added
in
an
undertone
,
``
but
it
will
pass

``
Allow

began
Vladimir

,
``
where
do

``
Possibly
here

The

Bored

You
surprise
me

How
is
that
possible

And
Vladimir
Sergeitch
fell
to
describing
all
the
conveniences
,
charms
and
advantages
of
life
in
the
capital
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
lis-
tened
attentively
without
taking
her
eyes
off
him
.
She
seemed
to
be
studying
his
features
and
from
time
to
time
smiled
to
herself
.
``
I
see
you
are
very
eloquent
,

she
said
at
last
;
``
I
shall
have
to
spend
the
winter
in
Petersburg

''
''
You
will
not
regret
it

declared
Vladimir

silence

``
Allow

Nadyezhda

with
swift
mockery

``
Oh

Nadyezhda

smiled
again

A

No

have
risen
,
''
she
added
,
getting
up
from
her
seat
and
glancing
at
the
open
window
,
''
that
's
moonlight
on
the
tops
of
the
poplars
.
It
's
time
to
go
.
.
.
.
I
'll
go
and
tell
them
to
saddle
Beauty
.
''
``
He
is
saddled
,
''
said
her
page
,
stepping
out
of
the
shade
of
the
park
into
the
streak
of
light
that
fell
on
the
verandah
,
''
Oh
,
that
's
right
!
Masha
,
where
are
you
?
Come
and
say
good-bye
.
''
Marya
Pavlovna
came
in
from
the
adjoin-
ing
room
.
The
men
got
up
from
the
card-
table
.
``
Are
you
going
already
?
''
asked
Ipatov
.
``
Yes
,
it
's
time
.
''
She
went
towards
the
verandah
door
.
``
What
a
night
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
Come
nearer
,
put
your
face
out
;
do
you
feel
it
?
It
seems
to
be
breathing
.
And
what
a
scent
!
All
the
flowers
are
awake
now
.
They
wake
up
while
we
are
thinking
of
going
to
sleep
.
And
by
the
way
,
Masha
,
''
she
added
,
``
I
have
been
telling
Vladimir
Sergeitch
that
you
don't
like
poetry
.
And
now
good-bye
.
.
.
.
Here
they
are
bringing
my
horse
.
''
And
she
ran
rapidly
down
the
verandah
steps
,
leapt
lightly
into
the
saddle
,
said
,
``
Good-
bye
till
to-morrow
,
''
and
switching
the
horse
on
the
neck
,
galloped
to
the
dam
.
.
.
the
page
trotted
behind
her
.
Everyone
looked
after
her
.
``
Till
to-morrow
,
''
they
heard
her
voice
be-
yond
the
poplars
.
The
thud
of
hoof
?
was
au-
dible
for
a
long
time
in
the
stillness
of
the
sum-
mer
night
.
At
last
Ipatov
suggested
they
should
go
back
into
the
house
.
``
It
certainly
is
nice
in
the
open
air
,
''
he
said
,
''
but
we
must
finish
our
game
.
''
All
the
company
returned
to
the
house
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
asking
Marya
Pav-
lovna
why
she
did
not
like
poetry
.
``
I
do
n't
care
for
it
,
''
she
answered
with
seem-
ing
reluctance
.
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
''
But
perhaps
you
have
not
read
much
poetry
?
''
``
I
have
not
read
it
myself
but
it
has
been
read
to
me
.
''
``
And
v^^as
n't
there
a
single
poem
you
liked
?
''
``
No
,
not
one
.
''
``
Even
Pushkin
?
''
``
Even
Pushkin
.
''
``
Why
?
''
Marya
Pavlovna
made
no
answer
and
Ipatov
,
turning
round
,
said
over
the
back
of
his
chair
,
with
a
good-natured
laugh
,
that
she
did
not
only
dislike
poetry
but
even
sugar
,
and
in
fact
could
not
bear
sweet
things
at
all
.
``
But
there
are
poems
that
are
not
sweet
,
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
retorted
.
``
For
instance
?
''
asked
Marya
Pavlovna
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
scratched
his
head
.
.
.
.
He
knew
very
little
poetry
by
heart
himself
,
particularly
of
the
kind
that
was
not
sweet
.
``
Well
,
''
he
cried
at
last
,
``
do
you
know
Push-
kin
's
'The
Upas
Tree
'
?
No
?
That
poem
can-
not
possibly
be
called
sweet
.
''
``
Repeat
it
,
''
IMarya
Pavlovna
asked
him
,
and
she
dropped
her
eyes
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
looked
at
the
ceiling
,
frowned
,
muttered
to
himself
and
at
last
re-
peated
``
The
Upas
Tree
.
''
After
the
first
four
verses
,
Marya
Pavlovna
slowly
raised
her
eyes
,
and
when
Vladimir
Sergeitch
finished
,
she
said
as
slowly
:
''
Please
repeat
it
over
again
.
''
``
You
like
the
poem
,
then
?
''
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
Repeat
it
again
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
recited
'The
Upas
Tree
''
again
.
Marya
Pavlovna
got
up
,
went
into
an-
other
room
and
came
back
with
a
sheet
of
paper
,
an
inkstand
and
a
pen
.
``
Please
write
it
out
for
me
,
''
she
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
Certainly
,
with
pleasure
,
''
he
answered
,
be
ginning
to
write
.
``
But
I
confess
I
wonder
why
you
like
this
poem
so
much
.
I
repeated
it
just
to
show
you
that
not
all
poetry
is
sweet
.
''
``
Well
,
I
declare
!
''
exclaimed
Ipatov
;
``
what
do
you
think
of
those
verses
,
Ivan
Ilyitch
?
''
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
as
usual
,
simply
glanced
at
Ipa-
tov
but
did
not
utter
a
word
.
^
''
Here
,
it
is
finished
,
''
said
Vladimir
Serge-
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
itch
,
putting
a
note
of
exclamation
at
the
end
of
the
last
line
.
Marya
Pavlovna
thanked
him
and
carried
off
the
copy
of
the
poem
to
her
own
room
.
Half
an
hour
later
supper
was
served
,
and
within
an
hour
all
the
guests
separated
to
their
rooms
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
more
than
once
ad-
dressed
Marya
Pavlovna
,
but
it
was
difficult
to
keep
up
a
conversation
with
her
,
and
the
things
he
said
did
not
seem
to
interest
her
much
.
He
would
probably
have
gone
off
to
sleep
at
once
on
getting
into
bed
if
he
had
not
been
kept
awake
by
his
neighbour
,
Yegor
Kapiton-
itch
.
The
husband
of
Matryona
Markovna
,
after
undressing
and
getting
into
bed
,
carried
on
a
long
conversation
with
his
servant
whom
he
kept
admonishing
.
Every
word
he
uttered
reached
Vladimir
Sergeitch
distinctly
;
the
rooms
were
only
divided
by
a
thin
partition
wall
.
``
Hold
the
candle
straight
in
front
of
you
,
''
said
Yegor
Kapitonitch
in
a
complaining
voice
,
''
hold
it
so
that
I
can
see
your
face
.
You
have
turned
my
hair
grey
,
you
unprincipled
fellow
,
you
've
turned
my
hair
grey
.
''
``
But
how
have
I
turned
your
hair
grey
,
Yegor
Kapitonitch
?
''
the
indistinct
and
sleepy
voice
of
the
servant
was
heard
.
``
How
?
I
'll
tell
you
how
.
How
many
times
have
I
said
to
you
,
'Mitka
,
'
I
have
said
to
you
,
'whenever
you
go
away
with
me

on
a
visit
,
always
pack
two
changes
of
clothes
,
particularly

the
candle
straight
in

of
you
.
.
.
particularly
of
under-
clothes
?
'
And
what
have
you
done
to
me
to-day
?
''
``
Why
,
what
,
sir
?
''
``
You
ask
what
?
What
am
I
to
put
on
to-
morrow
morning
?
''
``
Why
,
the
same
as
you
had
on
to-day
.
''
``
You
've
turned
my
hair
grey
,
you
ruffian
.
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
myself
,
I
was
so
hot
to-day
.
Hold
the
candle
straight
in
front
of
you
,
I
tell
you
,
and
do
n't
go
to
sleep
when
your
master
is
talking
to
you
.
''
``
And
Matryona
Markovna
told
me
it
was
enough
.
'Why
always
take
such
a
lot
of
things
with
you
?
'
she
said
.
'They
only
get
worn
out
for
nothing
.
'
``
''
Matryona
Markovna
.
...
As
though
it
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
were
a
woman
's
business
to
go
into
that
!
You
've
turned
my
hair
grey
,
you
have
!
''
``
And
Yahim
said
so
,
too
.
''
``
What
did
you
say
?
''
``
I
say
,
Yahim
said
so
,
too
.
''
``
Yahim
!
Yahim
!
''
Yegor
Kapitonitch
re-
peated
reproachfully
.
``
You
'll
be
the
death
of
me
,
you
heathens
.
They
ca
n't

Why

does

Yefim
well
,
at
a
pinch

can
say
that
,
for
the
real
Greek
name

do
you
under-
stand
me
?
.
.
.
Hold
the
candle
straight
be-
fore
you
.
.
.
.
But
for
shortness
one
may
say
Yefim
,
but
certainly
not
Yahim
.
Yahim
!
''
re-
peated
Yegor
Kapitonitch
with
an
emphasis
on
the
ya
.
``
You
've
turned
my
hair
grey
,
you
vil-
lains
.
Hold
the
candle
straight
before
you
!
''
And
Yegor
Kapitonitch
went
on
for
a
long
time
lecturing
his
servant
,
in
spite
of
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
sighs
,
coughs
and
other
signs
of
impatience
.
At
last
he
dismissed
his
Mitka
and
went
to
sleep
,
but
this
did
not
improve
matters
for
Vlad-
imir
Sergeitch
:
Yegor
Kapitonitch
had
such
a
deep
and
powerful
snore
,
with
such
playful
transitions
from
the
highest
treble
to
the
deep-
est
bass
,
with
such
whistling
and
even
clicking
sounds
,
that
the
very
partition
wall
seemed
to
be
quivering
in
response
to
it
.
Poor
Vladimir
Sergeitch
felt
ready
to
cry
.
It
was
very
stuffy
in
his
room
and
the
feather
bed
on
which
he
lay
seemed
to
wrap
his
whole
person
in
a
sort
of
creeping
heat
.
In
despair
Vladimir
Sergeitch
got
up
at
last
,
opened
his
window
and
greedily
drank
in
the
fragrant
freshness
of
the
night
.
The
window
looked
into
the
park
;
the
sky
was
light
;
the
round
face
of
the
full
moon
was
at
one
moment
reflected
clearly
in
the
pond
,
at
the
next
was
drawn
out
into
a
long
golden
sheaf
of
slowly
shifting
sparkles
.
In
one
of
the
garden
paths
Vladimir
Sergeitch
saw
a
figure
dressed
like
a
woman
:
it
was
Marya
Pavlovna
;
in
the
moon-
light
her
face
looked
pale
.
She
stood
motion-
less
and
suddenly
began
speaking
.
.
.
.
Vlad-
imir
Sergeitch
cautiously
put
out
his
head
.
``
Yet
thither
with
imperious
glance
A
man
his
fellow-man
has
sent
''
reached
his
hearing
.
A
OUIET
6ACICWATER
''
Imagine
that
!
''
he
thought
;
``
so
the
verses
have
had
an
effect
on
her
.
...
''
And
he
listened
with
redoubled
attention
.
But
Marya
Pavlovna
soon
ceased
speaking
and
turned
more
directly
facing
him
:
he
could
dis-
tinguish
her
large
dark
eyes
,
her
severe
brow
and
lips
.
Suddenly
she
started
,
turned
round
,
passed
into
the
shadow
cast
by
a
dense
wall
of
tall
acacias
and
disappeared
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
remained
standing
a
considerable
time
at
the
window
,
then
at
last
he
got
into
bed
but
did
not
soon
fall
asleep
,
''
A
strange
creature
''
he
thought
as
he
turned
from
side
to
side
``
and
they
say
there
is
noth-
ing
special
to
be
found
in
the
country
.
.
.
.
Yes
,
indeed
!
A
strange
creature
!
I
'll
ask
her
to-morrow
what
she
was
doing
in
the
garden
.
''
Yegor
Kapitonitch
was
still
snoring
as
be-
fore
.

CHAPTER
III
Next
morning
Vladimir
Sergeitch
woke
rather
late
and
immediately
after
breakfast
in
the
dining-room
went
home
to
make
final
arrange-
ments
on
his
estate
,
in
spite
of
old
Ipatov's
efforts
to
keep
him
.
Marya
Pavlovna
was
present
at
breakfast
;
Vladimir
Sergeitch
did
not
think
it
necessary
,
however
,
to
question
her
about
her
walk
in
the
garden
in
the
night
:
he
belonged
to
that
class
of
people
to
whom
it
is
difficult
to
give
themselves
up
for
two
days
together
to
unaccustomed
thoughts
and
con-
jectures
.
He
would
have
had
to
talk
about
the
poem
and
the
``
poetical
''
mood
as
it
is
called
soon
wearied
him
.
He
spent
the
whole
day
in
the
fields
till
dinner
,
for
which
he
had
a
keen
appetite
,
had
a
nap
,
and
on
waking
up
was
about
to
look
through
the
rural
clerk
's
account
,
but
before
he
had
finished
the
first
page
or-
dered
his
carriage
and
set
off
to
Ipatovka
.
Evi-
y
(
i
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
dently
even
practical
people
have
not
hearts
of
stone
and
are
no
fonder
of
being
dull
than
ordi-
nary
mortals
.
As
he
drove
on
to
the
dam
he
heard
voices
and
the
sound
of
music
.
At
Ipatov
's
house
they
were
singing
Russian
songs
in
chorus
.
He
found
on
the
verandah
the
whole
company
he
had
left
in
the
morning
;
they
all
,
among
them
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
,
were
sitting
in
a
semi-
circle
round
a
man
of
about
thirty-two
,
with
a
dark
complexion
,
black
hair
and
black
eyes
,
wearing
a
short
velvet
coat
and
a
red
cravat
tied
loosely
round
his
neck
,
and
holding
a
guitar
in
his
hands
.
This
was
Pyotr
Alexeitch
Veret-
yev
,
the
brother
of
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
.
On
seeing
Vladimir
Sergeitch
old
Ipatov
went
to
meet
him
with
an
exclamation
of
delight
,
led
him
up
to
Veretyev
and
introduced
them
.
After
exchanging
the
usual
greetings
with
his
new
acquaintance
,
Astahov
bowed
respect-
fully
to
the
latter
's
sister
.
``
We
are
singing
songs
in
the
village
style
,
''
began
Ipatov
,
and
,
indicating
Veretyev
,
he
added
,
``
Pyotr
Alexeitch
is
our
conductor
and
such
a
conductor
!
you
will
hear
.
''
V7
The
two
friends
and
otHfiR
stories
''
It
is
very
delightful
,
''
answered
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
Wo
n't
you
join
the
chorus
?
''
asked
Nad-
yezhda
Alexyevna
.
``
I
should
be
delighted
but
I
have
no
voice
.
''
``
That
does
not
matter
!
Look
,
Yegor
Kapi-
tonitch
is
singing
and
I
am
singing
.
You
need
only
join
in
.
Sit
down
;
begin
,
brother
.
''
``
What
song
shall
we
sing
now
?
''
said
Veret-
yev
,
strumming
on
the
guitar
and
,
stopping
suddenly
,
he
looked
at
Marya
Pavlovna
,
who
was
sitting
beside
him
.
``
I
think
it
is
your
turn
now
,
''
he
said
to
her
,
''
No
,
you
sing
,
''
answered
INIarya
Pavlovna
.
``
There
is
a
song
'Down
Mother
Volga
,
'
'*
Vladimir
Sergeitch
observed
with
dignity
.
``
No
,
we
are
saving
that
for
the
end
,
''
an-
swered
Veretyev
,
and
,
striking
the
strings
,
he
began
singing
,
dwelling
on
each
note
``
The
Sun
Is
Setting
.
''
'
He
sang
capitally
,
with
spirit
and
gaiety
.
His
manly
face
,
which
was
expressive
at
all
times
,
became
even
livelier
when
he
was
singing
;
now
and
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
suddenly
pressed
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
on
the
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
strings
,
raised
his
hand
,
shook
his
cuds
and
looked
round
him
with
a
keen
,
proud
air
.
In
Moscow
he
had
more
than
once
seen
the
famous
gipsy
Ilya
and
was
imitating
him
.
The
chorus
seconded
him
vigorously
.
Marya
Pavlovna's
mellow
voice
stood
out
above
all
the
others
;
it
seemed
to
lead
the
others
;
but
she
would
not
sing
alone
and
Veretyev
remained
the
con-
ductor
to
the
end
.
They
sang
many
other
songs
.
Meanwhile
a
storm
was
coming
on
with
the
approach
of
evening
.
It
had
been
stiflingly
hot
since
mid-day
and
there
had
been
rumblings
in
the
distance
;
but
now
a
broad
storm-cloud
,
which
had
long
lain
like
a
leaden
shroud
on
the
very
rim
of
the
horizon
,
began
to
grow
and
appear
above
the
tree-tops
;
the
sultry
air
began
quivering
more
perceptibly
,
more
and
more
vio-
lently
troubled
by
the
approaching
storm
;
a
wind
sprang
up
,
rustled
abruptly
among
the
leaves
,
sank
into
silence
,
again
set
up
a
pro-
longed
rustling
and
howled
among
the
trees
;
a
gloomy
darkness
moved
rapidly
over
the
land
,
driving
before
it
the
last
glow
of
sunset
;
dense
clouds
,
as
though
suddenly
released
,
floated
upwards
and
flew
across
the
sky
;
there
came
a
spatter
of
rain
,
a
red
flash
of
lightning
and
a
heavy
,
angry
roll
of
thunder
.
``
Let
us
go
in
,
''
said
old
Ipatov
,
``
or
we
may
get
wet
.
''
Everyone
got
up
.
``
In
a
minute
,
''
cried
Veretyev
.
``
Let
us
have
the
last
song
.
Listen
:
''
'Oh
,
my
porch
,
oh
,
my
new
porch
.
'
``
He
sang
in
a
loud
voice
,
rapidly
striking
the
chords
with
the
whole
of
his
hand
.
``
My
porch
of
maple
.
''
The
chorus
took
it
up
as
though
carried
away
by
the
tune
.
Almost
at
the
same
instant
the
rain
came
lashing
down
in
streams
;
but
Veretyev
sang
``
My
porch
''
to
the
end
.
Drowned
from
time
to
time
by
peals
of
thunder
,
the
gay
reckless
song
sounded
even
gayer
and
more
reckless
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
noisy
patter
and
gurgling
of
the
rain
.
Finally
the
last
outburst
of
the
chorus
rang
out
and
the
whole
company
ran
,
laughing
,
into
the
draw-
ing-room
.
The
little
girls
,
Ipatov
's
daughters
,
laughed
more
loudly
than
anyone
as
they
shook
the
raindrops
off
their
dresses
.
Ipatov
,
how-
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
ever
,
by
way
of
precaution
,
dosed
the
window
and
the
door
,
and
Yegor
Kapitonitch
com-
mended
his
prudence
,
observing
that
Matryona
Markovna
too
insisted
on
all
windows
and
doors
being
shut
during
a
storm
,
since
electricity
acts
more
freely
in
an
empty
space
.
Bodryakov
looked
into
his
face
,
moved
away
and
upset
a
chair
.
Such
little
mishaps
were
very
frequent
with
him
.
The
storm
was
very
quickly
over
.
The
doors
and
windows
were
opened
again
and
the
rooms
were
filled
with
moist
fragrance
.
Tea
was
brought
in
.
After
tea
the
old
gentlemen
sat
down
to
cards
again
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
as
usual
,
seated
himself
beside
them
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
up
to
Marya
Pavlovna
,
who
was
sitting
in
the
window
with
Veretyev
;
but
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
summoned
him
and
immediately
en-
tered
into
a
lively
conversation
with
him
about
Petersburg
and
Petersburg
life
.
She
attacked
it
;
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
defending
it
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
seemed
anxious
to
keep
him
at
her
side
.
``
What
are
you
arguing
about
?
''
said
Veret-
yev
,
getting
up
and
coming
towards
them
.
He
walked
with
a
lazy
swing
;
in
all
his
move-
ments
there
was
something
between
noncha-
lance
and
indolence
.
'
``
About
Petersburg
,
''
answered
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
.
``
Vladimir
Sergeitch
can
not
say
enough
in
its
praise
.
''
``
It
's
a
nice
town
,
''
observed
Veretyev
``
but
I
think
it
's
nice
everywhere
.
Yes
,
really
.
Where
there
are
two
or
three
women
and
,
ex-
cuse
my
frankness
,
wine
,
man
really
has
noth-
ing
left
to
desire
.
''
``
That
surprises
me
,
''
answered
Vladimir
Sergeitch
;
``
can
you
really
be
of
the
opinion
that
for
fin
educated
man
there
exists
nothing
?
.
.
.
''
``
Perhaps
.
.
.
just
so
...
I
agree
with
you
,
''
interrupted
Veretyev
,
who
with
all
his
politeness
had
the
habit
of
not
letting
other
people
finish
their
sentences
.
``
But
that
's
not
in
my
line
;
I
am
not
a
philosopher
.
''
``
I
am
not
a
philosopher
either
,
''
said
Vladi-
mir
Sergeitch
,
``
and
have
no
desire
to
be
one
,
but
.
we
are
talking
of
something
quite
dif-
ferent
.
''
Veretyev
looked
at
his
sister
with
a
non-
A
OUlET
BACKWATER
chalant
air
,
and
with
a
faint
smile
she
bent
down
to
him
and
half-whispered
:
''
Petrusha
,
darling
,
act
Yegor
Kapitonitch
for
us
,
do
!
''
Veretyev
's
face
instantly
changed
and
God
knows
by
what
miracle
in
a
flash
be-
came
extraordinarily
like
that
of
Yegor
Kapi-
tonitch
,
though
there
was
nothing
in
common
in
the
features
of
the
one
and
the
other
,
and
all
that
Veretyev
did
was
to
wrinkle
up
his
nose
and
drop
the
corners
of
his
mouth
.
``
Of
course
,
''
he
began
,
whispering
in
a
voice
exactly
like
Yegor
Kapitonitch
's
``
Matryona
Markovna
is
a
lady
very
strict
on
the
point
of
manners
,
but
she
is
an
exemplary
wife
.
It
is
true
that
whatever
I
say
.
.
.
''
``
The
Biryulovsky
young
ladies
know
all
about
it
,
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
put
in
,
hardly
able
to
restrain
her
laughter
.
``
They
know
all
about
it
next
day
,
''
answered
Veretyev
with
such
a
killing
grimace
,
such
an
embarrassed
side
glance
that
even
Vladimir
Sergeitch
laughed
.
``
You
have
a
great
talent
for
mimicry
,
I
see
,
''
he
observed
,
Veretyev
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
;
his
features
resumed
their
ordinary
expression
,
and
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
cried
:
''
Oh
,
yes
,
he
can
mimic
anyone
he
likes
.
.
.
.
He
has
a
genius
for
it
.
''
``
And
could
you
mimic
me
?
''
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
To
be
sure
he
can
!
''
said
Nadyezhda
Alex-
yevna
.
``
I
should
think
so
!
''
``
Oh
,
please
do
mimic
me
,
''
said
Astahov
,
ad-
dressing
Veretyev
``
I
beg
you
not
to
stand
on
ceremony
.
''
``
Did
you
really
beHeve
her
?
''
answered
Veret-
yev
,
slightly
screwing
up
one
eye
and
giving
his
voice
Astahov
's
intonation
but
so
slightly
and
discreetly
that
only
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
noticed
it
and
bit
her
lip
.
``
You
must
n't
believe
her
,
please
;
she
may
tell
you
all
sorts
of
stories
about
me
.
''
``
And
if
only
you
knew
what
an
actor
he
is
!
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
went
on
``
he
can
act
any
character
.
It
's
so
wonderful
.
He
is
our
stage
manager
and
prompter
and
everything
.
It
is
a
pity
you
are
going
away
so
soon
.
''
``
Sister
,
your
partiality
blinds
you
,
''
Veretyev
observed
in
a
dignified
voice
but
still
with
the
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
same
intonation
.
``
What
will
Mr.
Astahov
think
of
you
?
He
will
think
you
are
a
pro-
vincial
young
lady
.
''
``
Oh
,
I
assure
you
...
''
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
was
beginning
.
``
Petrusha
,
I
tell
you
what
,
''
put
in
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
``
you
show
us
how
a
drunken
man
can
not
get
a
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
or
better
act
a
boy
trying
to
catch
a
fly
on
the
win-
dow
while
it
buzzes
under
his
fingers
.
''
``
You
are
a
regular
child
,
''
answered
Veretyev
.
He
got
up
,
however
,
and
going
to
the
window
by
which
Marya
Pavlovna
was
sitting
began
passing
his
hand
over
the
pane
and
acting
a
boy
catching
a
fly
.
The
accuracy
with
which
he
imitated
the
pitiful
buzz
of
the
insect
was
really
amazing
.
It
seemed
as
though
a
real
fly
were
under
his
fingers
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
laughed
and
gradually
everyone
in
the
room
began
laughing
.
Marya
Pavlovna
's
face
did
not
change
,
however
;
there
was
not
even
a
quiver
on
her
lips
.
She
sat
with
downcast
eyes
;
at
last
she
raised
them
and
looking
with
a
grave
face
at
Veretyev
she
brought
out
through
her
teeth
:
''
It
's
a
strange
taste
to
want
to
make
a
fool
of
yourself
.
''
Veretyev
turned
away
from
the
window
at
once
and
after
standing
for
a
little
while
in
the
middle
of
the
room
went
out
on
to
the
verandah
and
from
it
into
the
park
which
was
by
now
wrapped
in
darkness
.
``
He
is
an
amusing
fellow
,
that
Pyotr
Alexe-
itch
!
''
observed
Yegor
Kapitonitch
,
flinging
down
a
seven
of
trumps
on
his
opponent
's
ace
.
``
He
really
is
an
amusing
fellow
!
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
got
up
and
,
going
hur-
riedly
to
Marya
Pavlovna
,
asked
her
in
an
undertone
:
''
What
did
you
say
to
my
brother
?
''
``
Nothing
,
''
she
answered
.
``
What
do
you
mean
by
'nothing
'
?
It
can't
have
been
nothing
.
''
And
after
a
brief
pause
Nadyezhda
Alex-
yevna
brought
out
``
come
along
,
''
took
Marya
Pavlovna
by
the
hand
,
made
her
get
up
and
go
with
her
into
the
garden
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
looked
after
the
two
young
ladies
with
some
surprise
.
But
their
absence
did
not
last
long
;
they
came
back
within
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
Pyotr
Alexeitch
came
in
with
them
.
``
Such
a
lovely
night
!
''
cried
Nadyezhda
Alex-
yevna
as
she
walked
in
.
``
How
nice
it
is
in
the
garden
!
''
``
Oh
,
yes
,
by
the
way
,
''
said
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
``
was
it
you
I
saw
in
the
garden
last
night
,
Marya
Pavlovna
?
''
Marya
Pavlovna
glanced
rapidly
into
his
eyes
.
``
You
were
reciting
Pushkin
's
'Upas
Tree/
if
I
am
not
mistaken
.
''
Veretyev
gave
a
slight
frown
and
also
began
looking
at
Astahov
.
``
Yes
,
it
was
me
,
''
said
Marya
Pavlovna
,
``
but
I
was
not
reciting
anything
;
I
never
recite
.
''
``
Perhaps
it
was
my
fancy
,
''
began
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
``
though
.
.
.
''
``
It
was
your
fancy
,
''
Marya
Pavlovna
added
coldly
.
``
What
is
this
'Upas
Tree
?
'
''
asked
Na-
dyezhda
Alexyevna
.
i
''
Do
n't
you
know
?
''
answered
Astahov
.
``
Pushkin
's
poem
'on
poor
and
meagre
soil
'
;
do
n't
you
remember
it
?
''
``
I
do
n't
seem
to
.
.
.
It
's
about
a
poisonous
tree
,
is
n't
it
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
Like
the
datura
.
...
Do
you
remember
,
Masha
,
how
beautiful
the
datura
plants
were
on
our
balcony
in
the
moonlight
with
their
long
white
flowers
?
Do
you
remember
the
sweet
,
insidious
,
treacherous
scent
they
had
?
''
``
Treacherous
scent
!
''
cried
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
.
``
Yes
,
treacherous
.
Why
does
that
surprise
you
?
They
say
it
is
dangerous
,
but
yet
it
at-
tracts
one
.
How
is
it
evil
things
can
attract
one
?
What
is
evil
ought
not
to
be
lovely
.
''
``
Oho
!
What
profound
reflections
!
''
ob-
served
Pyotr
Alexeitch
,
``
We
have
got
a
long
way
from
the
poem
!
''
``
I
repeated
that
poem
to
Marya
Pavlovna
yesterday
,
''
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
``
and
she
liked
it
extremely
.
''
``
Oh
,
do
repeat
it
,
please
,
''
said
Nadyezhda
A.lexyevna
.
``
Certainly
.
''
And
Astahov
repeated
``
The
Upas
Tree
.
''
``
Too
stilted
,
''
Veretyev
brought
out
as
it
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
were
reluctantly
as
soon
as
Vladimir
Sergeitch
had
finished
.
``
The
poem
is
too
stilted
?
''
``
No
,
not
the
poem
...
I
beg
your
pardon
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
did
not
repeat
it
simply
enough
.
The
thing
speaks
for
itself
;
however
,
I
may
be
mistaken
.
''
``
No
,
you
are
not
mistaken
,
''
said
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
emphatically
,
''
Oh
,
no
,
we
all
know
that
!
In
your
eyes
I
am
a
genius
,
a
gifted
person
,
who
knows
every-
thing
and
can
do
everything
,
only
unluckily
he
is
too
lazy
that
's
it
,
is
n't
it
?
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
merely
nodded
her
head
.
``
I
do
n't
dispute
it
;
you
ought
to
know
better
than
I
,
''
observed
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
and
be-
came
a
little
sulky
.
``
It
is
not
in
my
line
.
''
Meanwhile
the
game
of
cards
was
over
.
``
Oh
,
by
the
way
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
''
said
Ipatov
,
getting
up
``
a
gentleman
of
our
neigh-
bourhood
,
a
most
excellent
and
worthy
man
,
Gavril
Stepanitch
Akilin
,
asks
you
to
do
him
the
honour
to
come
to
his
ball
.
That
is
,
I
call
it
a
ball
to
give
it
a
fine
name
,
but
it
is
simply
a
little
evening
party
,
a
dance
without
cere-
mony
.
He
would
have
certainly
called
upon
you
himself
but
he
was
afraid
of
disturbing
you
.
''
``
I
am
very
grateful
to
the
gentleman

said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
``
but
I
absolutely
must
go
home

``
But
when
do
you
suppose

to-morrow

One
day
will
make
no

you

much
pleasure

And
it

only
seven
miles
from

If

we
'll
drive
you
there

``
I
really

Vladimir
Serge-

``
Are

``
Yes

Ipatov

``
Well

Gavril
Stepanitch

simply
delighted

n't
he

Ivan
Ilyitch

''
Ivan
Ilyitch
would
have
liked
to
remain
silent
as
usual
,
but
thought
it
better
to
emit
a
sound
of
approval
.
``
What
possessed
you
,
''
Pyotr
Alexeitch
asked
his
sister
an
hour
later
as
he
sat
beside
her
in
a
light
chaise
which
he
drove
himself
``
what
possessed
you
to
force
yourself
on
that
muff
for
the
mazurka
?
''
``
I
have
my
own
reasons
,
''
answered
Nad-
yezhda
Alexyevna
.
``
What
are
they
,
may
I
ask
?
''
``
That
's
my
secret
.
''
``
Oho
!
''
And
he
gave
a
light
switch
to
the
horse
which
had
begun
to
twitch
its
ears
,
snort
and
shy
.
It
was
frightened
by
the
shadow
of
a
big
bush
of
\villow
that
lay
across
the
road
in
the
dim
moonHght
.
``
And
will
you
dance
it
with
Masha
?
''
Nad-
yezhda
Alexyevna
questioned
her
brother
in
her
turn
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
answered
indifferently
.
``
Yes
!
Yes
!
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
repeated
reproachfully
.
``
You
men
,
''
she
added
after
a
pause
,
``
certainly
do
not
deserve
to
be
loved
by
decent
women
.
''
``
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
And
that
Petersburg
muff
,
does
he
deserve
to
be
?
''
``
Better
than
you
do
.
''
``
Oh
indeed
!
''
And
Pyotr
Alexeitch
declaimed
with
a
sigh
:
''
What
a
task
it
is
,
O
Lord
,
To
be
.
.
.
the
brother
of
a
grown-up
sister
.
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
laughed
.
``
I
give
you
a
lot
of
trouble
,
indeed
!
It
's
I
who
have
a
task
with
you
.
''
``
Really
?
I
did
not
suspect
it
.
''
``
I
am
not
talking
about
Masha
.
''
``
What
about
then
?
''
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
's
face
looked
a
little
troubled
.
``
You
know
very
well
,
''
she
said
softly
.
``
Oh
,
I
understand
!
There
's
no
help
for
it
,
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
,
I
am
fond
of
a
glass
of
wine
in
good
company
,
sinful
man
that
I
am
!
''
``
Hush
,
brother
,
please
do
n't
talk
like
that
.
.
.
.
It
's
not
a
joking
matter
.
''
``
Tram
-
tram
-
tam
-
poom
,
''
Pyotr
Alexeitch
muttered
between
his
teeth
.
``
It
will
be
your
ruin
,
and
you
make
a
joke
of
it
.
''
``
The
Peasant
Lad
the
Wheat
Is
Sowing
'
``
Pyotr
Alexeitch
sang
aloud
,
switched
the
horse
with
the
reins
and
it
broke
into
a
rapid
trot
.
CHAPTER
IV
When
he
got
home
Veretyev
did
not
undress
,
and
two
hours
later
,
when
the
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
glow
in
the
sky
,
he
was
out
of
the
house
.
Halfway
between
his
estate
and
Ipatov
's
,
on
the
precipitous
edge
of
a
broad
ravine
,
there
was
a
small
birch
copse
.
The
young
trees
were
growing
very
close
together
;
no
axe
had
yet
touched
their
slender
stems
;
a
patch
of
light
but
almost
unbroken
shadow
was
thrown
by
their
fine
leaves
on
the
soft
,
delicate
grass
,
all
spangled
with
the
golden
heads
of
hen-dazzle
,
the
white
specks
of
wood
harebells
and
the
crimson
crosses
of
the
wild
pinks
.
The
newly
risen
sun
flooded
the
whole
copse
with
vivid
but
not
glaring
light
;
dewdrops
were
glittering
on
all
sides
;
here
and
there
a
big
drop
would
suddenly
glow
crimson
.
Everything
was
breathing
with
freshness
,
with
life
and
that
A
.
QUIET
BACKWATER
innocent
solemnity
of
the
first
moments
of
morning
when
everything
is
already
so
bright
and
yet
still
so
silent
.
There
was
no
sound
but
the
trilling
notes
of
larks
over
the
distant
fields
and
in
the
copse
itself
two
or
three
birds
were
without
haste
trying
their
brief
bars
and
as
it
were
listening
to
the
effect
.
From
the
wet
earth
rose
a
strong
,
fresh
fragrance
;
the
pure
light
air
was
stirred
by
cool
breezes
.
There
was
a
feeling
of
morning
,
of
a
glorious
sum-
mer
morning
about
everything
:
everything
had
the
look
and
smile
of
morning
like
the
rosy
,
freshly
washed
little
face
of
a
child
just
awake
.
Not
far
from
the
ravine
in
the
middle
of
a
glade
Veretyev
was
sitting
on
a
cloak
spread
on
the
ground
.
Marya
Pavlovna
was
standing
by
him
,
leaning
against
a
birch-tree
,
with
her
hands
behind
her
.
They
were
both
silent
.
]
\Iarya
Pavlovna
was
looking
fixedly
into
the
distance
;
her
white
scarf
had
slipped
off
her
head
on
to
her
shoulders
,
the
breeze
stirred
and
lifted
the
ends
of
her
hastily
coiled
hair
.
Veret-
yev
sat
bending
down
,
striking
the
ground
with
a
twig
.
The
two
friends
and
other
stories
''
Well
,
''
he
began
at
last
,
``
are
you
angry
with
me
?
''
Marya
Pavlovna
did
not
answer
.
Veretyev
glanced
at
her
.
``
Masha
,
are
you
angry
?
''
he
repeated
.
Marya
Pavlovna
took
a
rapid
glance
at
him
,
turned
slightly
away
and
said
:
''
Yes
.
''
``
What
for
?
''
asked
Veretyev
,
and
he
threw
away
the
twig
.
Again
Marya
Pavlovna
did
not
answer
.
``
You
have
a
right
to
be
angry
with
me
,
though
,
''
Veretyev
went
on
after
a
brief
silence
.
``
You
must
look
upon
me
not
merely
as
frivo-
lous
but
even
.
.
.
''
``
You
do
n't
understand
me
,
''
Marya
Pavlovna
interrupted
.
``
I
am
not
angry
with
you
on
my
own
account
at
all
.
''
``
On
whose
,
then
?
''
``
On
your
own
.
''
Veretyev
raised
his
head
and
gave
a
short
laugh
.
``
Ah
,
I
understand
!
''
he
began
.
``
Again
!
you
are
beginning
to
be
worried
again
at
the
thought
of
my
not
doing
anything
with
myself
.
You
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
know
,
Masha
,
you
are
a
wonderful
creature
,
you
really
are
.
You
think
so
much
about
other
people
and
so
little
about
yourself
.
You
have
no
egoism
at
all
,
really
there
is
not
another
girl
like
you
in
the
world
.
But
the
trouble
is
that
I
do
n't
deserve
your
affection
;
I
tell
you
that
in
earnest
.
''
``
So
much
the
worse
for
you
.
You
feel
and
you
do
nothing
.
''
Veretyev
gave
a
short
laugh
again
.
``
Masha
,
pull
your
hand
from
behind
your
back
and
give
it
to
me
,
''
he
said
with
an
in-
sinuating
caress
in
his
voice
.
Marya
Pavlovna
merely
shrugged
her
shoul-
der
.
``
Give
me
your
beautiful
,
honest
hand
;
I
want
to
implant
a
tender
and
respectful
kiss
upon
it
,
as
the
frivolous
pupil
kisses
the
hand
of
his
indulgent
preceptor
.
''
And
Veretyev
stretched
forward
towards
Marya
Pavlovna
.
``
Oh
,
do
n't
!
''
she
said
;
``
you
are
always
laugh-
ing
and
joking
and
will
joke
away
all
your
life
.
''
``
H
'm
!
Joke
away
my
life
!
A
new
expres-
sion
!
I
suppose
,
Marya
Pavlovna
,
you
used
the
verb
'joke
away
'
in
a
transitive
sense
?
''
Marya
Pavlovna
frowned
.
``
Do
n't
,
Veretyev
,
''
she
repeated
.
``
Joke
away
my
life
,
''
repeated
Veretyev
,
and
he
got
up
``
but
you
will
make
a
worse
busi-
ness
of
it
than
I
shall
;
you
will
waste
your
life
in
taking
things
seriously
.
Do
you
know
,
Masha
,
you
remind
me
of
a
scene
in
Pushkin's
'Don
Juan
,
'
You
have
not
read
Pushkin
's
'Don
Juan
?
'
''
``
No
.
''
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
forgot
,
you
do
n't
read
poetry
.
A
lady
called
Laura
has
visitors
come
to
see
her
;
she
drives
them
all
away
and
is
left
alone
with
a
man
called
Carlos
.
They
go
out
to-
gether
on
the
balcony
;
it
is
a
glorious
night
.
Laura
admires
it
and
Carlos
suddenly
begins
to
point
out
to
her
that
she
will
grow
old
some
day-
'What
of
it
?
'
Laura
answers
``
at
this
moment
perhaps
it
is
cold
and
raining
in
Paris
but
here
'the
night
is
fragrant
of
lemons
and
laurels
.
'
What
's
the
use
of
looking
into
the
future
?
Look
about
you
,
Masha
,
is
it
not
lovely
here
?
Look
how
everything
is
rejoicing
in
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
life
,
how
youthful
it
all
is
.
And
are
n't
we
young
ourselves
?
''
Veretyev
went
closer
to
Marya
Pavlovna
;
she
did
not
draw
back
but
she
did
not
turn
her
head
towards
him
.
``
Smile
,
Masha
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
only
your
kind
,
good
smile
and
not
your
usual
mocking
one
.
I
love
your
good
,
kind
smile
raise
your
proud
,
stern
eyes
.
Well
?
You
turn
away
.
Hold
out
your
hand
to
me
,
anyway
.
''
``
Ah
,
Veretyev
,
''
Masha
began
,
``
you
know
I
ca
n't
talk
.
You
tell
me
about
that
Laura
.
But
she
was
a
woman
.
It
's
pardonable
for
a
woman
not
to
think
of
the
future
.
''
``
When
you
speak
,
Masha
,
''
replied
Veretyev
,
''
you
continually
blush
from
pride
and
shyness
;
the
blood
comes
rushing
to
your
cheeks
in
a
flood
of
colour
;
I
like
that
awfully
in
you
.
''
Marya
Pavlovna
looked
straight
into
Veret-
yev
's
eyes
.
``
Good-bye
,
''
she
said
,
and
she
pulled
her
scarf
on
to
her
head
.
Veretyev
held
her
back
.
``
There
,
there
,
''
he
cried
,
``
wait
a
little
!
What
is
it
you
want
?
Give
me
my
orders
.
Would
you
like
me
to
go
into
the
service
,
to
become
a
farmer
?
Would
you
like
me
to
publish
songs
with
accompaniments
on
the
guitar
,
to
publish
a
collection
of
poems
,
of
drawings
,
to
take
up
painting
,
sculpture
,
rope-dancing
?
I
'll
do
any-
thing
,
anything
you
tell
me
,
if
only
you
will
be
pleased
with
me
.
I
will
really
,
Masha
,
be-
lieve
me
.
''
Marya
Pavlovna
glanced
at
him
again
.
``
All
that
is
only
words
,
not
deeds
.
You
assure
me
you
obey
me
.
.
.
''
``
Of
course
,
I
do
obey
.
''
``
You
obey
me
but
how
many
times
have
I
asked
you
.
.
.
''
``
What
?
''
Marya
Pavlovna
hesitated
.
``
Not
to
drink
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
``
Ech
,
Masha
,
Masha
!
So
you
are
at
that
too
!
My
sister
distresses
herself
about
that
.
But
in
the
first
place
I
am
not
a
drunkard
;
and
in
the
second
,
do
you
know
why
I
drink
?
Look
at
that
swallow
there
.
.
.
.
See
how
boldly
it
disposes
of
its
little
body
;
it
flings
it
wherever
it
likes
!
See
,
it
has
darted
upwards
and
now
it
has
dropped
down
;
it
actually
squealed
with
joy
;
do
you
hear
?
So
that
's
why
I
drink
,
Q
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Masha
to
experience
the
same
sensations
as
that
swallow
...
to
fling
oneself
where
one
will
,
to
fly
where
the
fancy
takes
one
.
.
.
''
``
But
what
is
it
all
for
?
''
Masha
interrupted
.
``
How
can
you
ask
that
?
What
else
is
there
to
live
for
?
''
``
And
ca
n't
it
be
done
without
drinking
?
''
``
No
,
it
ca
n't
:
we
are
all
blighted
and
de-
generate
.
Passion
,
now
.
.
.
that
produces
the
same
effect
.
That
is
why
I
love
you
.
''
``
As
you
do
wine
.
.
.
much
obliged
.
''
``
No
,
Masha
;
I
love
you
not
as
I
do
wine
.
Wait
a
little
,
I
will
prove
it
to
you
some
day
when
we
are
married
and
go
abroad
.
Do
you
know
I
am
dreaming
already
how
I
shall
lead
you
before
the
Venus
of
Milo
.
It
will
be
just
the
moment
to
repeat
:
''
If
with
grave
eyes
she
stood
before
The
Queen
of
Love
from
Melos
famed
,
Of
the
two
goddesses
,
I
trow
,
The
marble
beauty
would
be
shamed
.
''
Why
is
it
I
keep
talking
in
verse
to-day
?
It
must
be
the
influence
of
the
morning
.
What
air
!
It
's
like
wine
.
''
``
Wine
again
,
''
observed
Marya
Pavlovna
,
''
What
of
it
?
Such
a
morning
and
you
with
me
what
could
be
more
intoxicating
?
'With
her
grave
eyes/
Yes
,
''
Veretyev
went
on
,
look-
ing
intently
at
Marya
Pavlovna
,
``
that
is
so
.
.
.
.
But
yet
I
remember
that
I
have
seen
not
often
it
is
true
,
but
I
have
seen
those
splendid
dark
eyes
look
tender
.
And
how
lovely
they
are
then
!
Come
,
do
n't
turn
away
,
Masha
,
laugh
,
anyway
.
.
.
Show
me
your
eyes
merry
,
at
least
,
if
they
wo
n't
grant
me
a
tender
look
.
''
``
Leave
ofif
,
Veretyev
,
''
said
Marya
Pavlovna
;
''
let
me
go
;
it
is
time
I
was
at
home
.
''
``
I
'll
make
you
laugh
,
though
,
''
Veretyev
in-
terposed
,
``
upon
my
word
I
will
.
Oh
,
look
,
there
runs
a
hare
!
''
``
Where
?
''
asked
Marya
Pavlovna
.
``
Over
there
,
beyond
the
ravine
,
through
the
field
of
oats
someone
must
have
frightened
it
;
they
do
n't
run
in
the
morning
.
Would
you
like
me
to
stop
it
?
''
And
Veretyev
gave
a
loud
whistle
.
The
hare
at
once
squatted
,
moved
its
ears
,
tucked
in
its
forepaws
,
drew
itself
up
,
munched
,
snififed
and
munched
again
!
Veretyev
nimbly
squatted
on
his
heels
like
the
hare
and
began
moving
his
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
nose
,
sniffing
and
munching
like
the
hare
.
The
hare
passed
its
paws
once
or
twice
over
its
face
,
shook
itself
its
paws
must
have
been
wet
with
the
dew
pricked
up
its
ears
and
bounded
off
.
Veretyev
rubbed
his
cheeks
with
his
hands
and
shook
himself
too
.
.
.
.
Mary
?
Pavlovna
could
not
refrain
from
laughing
.
``
Bravo
!
''
cried
Veretyev
,
and
he
jumped
up
,
''
bravo
!
You
certainly
are
not
a
coquette
.
Do
you
know
that
if
any
society
lady
had
teeth
like
yours
she
would
be
forever
laughing
!
But
that
is
what
I
love
you
for
,
Masha
,
that
you
are
not
a
society
lady
,
you
do
n't
laugh
without
occasion
,
you
do
n't
wear
gloves
,
and
it
is
so
nice
to
kiss
your
hands
because
they
are
sun-
burnt
and
one
feels
how
strong
they
are
.
.
.
.
I
love
you
because
you
do
n't
go
in
for
being
clever
,
because
you
are
proud
and
silent
,
don't
read
books
,
do
n't
like
poetry
.
.
.
''
``
Would
you
like
me
to
repeat
some
poetry
to
you
?
''
Marya
Pavlovna
interrupted
him
with
a
peculiar
expression
in
her
face
.
``
Poetry
?
''
said
Veretyev
in
surprise
.
``
Yes
,
some
poetry
which
that
Petersburg
gentleman
recited
to
us
last
night
.
''
``
The
'Upas
Tree
'
again
?
So
you
really
were
repeating
it
at
night
in
the
garden
?
The
poem
suits
you
.
.
.
.
But
do
you
really
like
it
so
much
?
''
``
Yes
,
I
like
it
.
''
``
Repeat
it
.
''
Marya
Pavlovna
was
a
little
abashed
.
``
Repeat
it
,
repeat
it
,
''
Veretyev
insisted
.
Marya
Pavlovna
began
repeating
it
.
Veret-
yev
stood
facing
her
,
folded
his
arms
and
lis-
tened
.
At
the
first
line
Marya
Pavlovna
lifted
her
eyes
towards
the
sky
:
she
did
not
want
to
meet
Veretyev
's
eyes
.
She
repeated
the
verses
in
her
mellow
even
voice
which
recalled
the
notes
of
a
violoncello
;
but
when
she
reached
the
lines
:
''
And
at
his
mighty
sovereign
's
feet
Fell
the
poor
slave
,
and
died
,
''
her
voice
quivered
,
her
haughty
,
immobile
eye-
brows
were
raised
naively
like
a
child
's
and
her
eyes
rested
on
Veretyev
with
involuntary
devotion
.
He
suddenly
flung
himself
at
her
feet
and
embraced
her
knees
.
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
''
I
am
your
slave
,
''
he
cried
,
``
I
am
at
your
feet
,
you
are
my
sovereign
,
my
goddess
,
my
ox-eyed
Hera
,
my
Medea
.
.
.
''
Marya
Pavlovna
vi^as
going
to
push
him
away
;
but
her
hands
lay
motionless
on
his
curly
hair
and
with
a
smile
of
confusion
she
bowed
her
head
.
CHAPTER
V
Gavril
Stepanitch
Akilin
,
who
was
giving
the
ball
,
belonged
to
that
class
of
country
gentle-
men
who
arouse
the
wonder
of
their
neighbours
by
their
faculty
of
living
well
and
keeping
open
house
on
insufficient
means
.
Though
he
had
no
more
than
four
hundred
serfs
he
entertained
the
whole
province
in
a
huge
stone
mansion
erected
by
himself
,
with
columns
,
with
a
tower
,
and
a
flagstaff
upon
it
.
His
estate
had
come
to
him
from
his
father
and
had
never
been
noted
for
its
good
condition
;
Gavril
Stepan-
itch
was
for
many
years
absent
from
it
,
serv-
ing
in
Petersburg
;
at
last
,
fifteen
years
pre-
viously
,
he
had
returned
to
his
native
place
with
the
grade
of
collegiate
assessor
,
with
a
wife
and
three
daughters
.
He
began
simul-
taneously
building
and
introducing
improve-
ments
,
immediately
set
up
an
orchestra
and
gave
dinner
parties
.
At
first
everyone
prophesied
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
that
he
would
inevitably
be
ruined
before
long
;
more
than
once
there
were
rumours
that
Gavril
Stepanitch
's
estate
was
to
be
sold
by
auction
;
but
the
years
passed
,
dinner
parties
,
balls
,
fetes
,
concerts
followed
one
another
as
before
,
new
buildings
rose
like
mushrooms
from
the
ground
,
and
Gavril
Stepanitch
's
estate
was
still
not
put
up
to
auction
and
he
went
on
living
as
before
and
had
even
grown
stout
of
late
.
Then
the
neighbours
'
gossip
took
another
turn
;
they
be-
gan
hinting
at
some
considerable
sums
which
had
,
they
said
,
been
kept
secret
,
there
was
talk
of
buried
treasure
.
.
.
,
``
If
he
had
been
a
good
manager
,
''
the
gentlemen
of
the
neighbourhood
argued
,
``
one
could
understand
it
,
but
he
is
not
,
not
at
all
!
That
's
what
is
so
surprising
and
unaccountable
.
''
However
that
might
be
,
every-
one
was
very
ready
to
visit
Gavril
Stepanitch
;
he
was
hospitable
and
would
play
cards
for
any
stake
.
He
was
a
little
man
with
grey
hair
and
a
conical-shaped
head
,
a
yellow
face
and
yellow
eyes
,
always
carefully
shaved
and
scented
with
eau-de-cologne
.
He
wore
on
ordi-
nary
days
as
well
as
on
holidays
a
loose
blue
swallowtail
,
buttoned
up
to
the
neck
,
a
big
cravat
into
which
he
had
the
habit
of
sticking
his
chin
,
and
he
prided
himself
on
his
linen
;
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
thrust
out
his
lips
when
he
took
snuff
and
spoke
very
softly
and
affably
.
Gavril
Stepanitch
was
not
distinguished
by
his
liveliness
and
in
fact
was
not
prepossessing
in
appearance
and
did
not
look
particularly
intel-
ligent
,
though
there
was
sometimes
a
gleam
of
cunning
in
his
eye
.
He
had
made
good
matches
for
his
two
elder
daughters
,
the
youngest
was
still
at
home
unmarried
.
Gavril
Stepanitch
had
also
a
wife
,
an
insignificant
creature
who
had
not
a
word
to
say
for
herself
.
At
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
Vladimir
Sergeitch
arrived
at
Ipatov
's
wearing
a
dress-
coat
and
white
gloves
.
He
found
them
all
dressed
ready
to
set
off
;
the
little
girls
were
sit-
ting
stiffly
,
afraid
of
crumpling
their
starched
white
frocks
.
Old
Ipatov
genially
reproached
Vladimir
Sergeitch
when
he
saw
that
the
young
man
was
wearing
a
dress-coat
,
and
pointed
to
his
own
frock-coat
.
Marya
Pavlovna
wore
a
deep
pink
muslin
dress
which
suited
her
ad-
mirably
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
paid
her
a
few
compliments
Marya
Pavlovna
's
beauty
at-
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
tracted
him
though
she
was
evidently
shy
of
him
;
he
liked
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
,
too
,
but
the
freedom
of
her
manners
rather
embarrassed
him
.
Moreover
,
in
her
words
,
in
her
looks
and
smiles
there
was
often
a
shade
of
mockery
,
and
that
troubled
his
well-bred
Petersburg
soul
.
He
would
have
had
no
objection
to
joining
her
in
mocking
other
people
,
but
it
was
disagreeable
that
she
might
perhaps
be
capable
of
laughing
at
him
.
The
ball
had
already
begun
;
a
good
many
guests
had
assembled
and
the
home-trained
orchestra
was
blaring
,
droning
and
squeaking
in
the
gallery
when
the
Ipatov
family
with
Vladimir
Sergeitch
entered
the
ballroom
.
Their
host
met
them
at
the
door
,
thanked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
for
the
feeling
way
in
which
he
had
so
agreeably
surprised
them
as
he
expressed
himself
and
,
taking
Ipatov
by
the
arm
,
he
led
him
off
to
the
drawing-room
,
to
the
card-tables
.
Gavril
Stepanitch
had
had
an
inferior
educa-
tion
,
and
everything
in
his
house
the
music
,
the
furniture
,
the
food
,
the
wines
could
not
even
be
called
second
rate
.
On
the
other
hand
there
was
plenty
of
everything
,
and
he
was
not
stuck
up
and
did
not
give
himself
airs
.
.
.
.
The
gentlemen
of
the
neighbourhood
asked
nothing
more
of
him
and
were
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
entertainment
he
gave
them
.
At
supper
,
for
instance
,
they
handed
caviare
cut
into
hard
blocks
and
over-salted
,
but
no
one
prevented
one
from
taking
it
with
one
's
fingers
,
and
there
was
plenty
to
wash
it
down
with
;
cheap
wine
,
it
is
true
,
but
real
wine
made
from
grapes
,
not
any
other
beverage
.
The
springs
in
the
furni-
ture
were
so
stiff
and
unyielding
as
to
be
rather
uncomfortable
,
but
to
say
nothing
of
there
being
many
armchairs
and
sofas
that
had
no
springs
at
all
,
anyone
could
get
hold
of
a
wool-
embroidered
cushion
to
put
on
his
seat
,
for
such
cushions
embroidered
by
Madame
Akilin's
own
hands
lay
about
in
great
profusion
every-
where
and
then
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
desired
.
In
short
Gavril
Stepanitch
's
house
was
per-
fectly
in
keeping
with
the
social
and
uncere-
monious
manners
of
the
X.
district
,
and
it
was
simply
due
to
Gavril
Stepanitch
's
own
modesty
that
the
marshal
of
the
nobility
elected
was
not
he
,
but
a
retired
major
called
Podpekin
,
a
very
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
respectable
and
worthy
man
though
he
combed
his
hair
from
his
left
ear
over
his
right
temple
,
dyed
his
moustache
a
purplish
tint
and
,
suffer-
ing
from
asthma
,
sank
into
depression
after
dinner
.
And
so
the
ball
had
already
begun
.
A
quad-
rille
of
ten
couples
was
being
danced
.
The
gentlemen
were
officers
of
a
regiment
stationed
in
the
neighbourhood
,
young
or
youngish
land-
owners
,
and
two
or
three
officials
from
the
town
.
Everything
was
as
it
should
be
,
everything
was
going
well
.
The
marshal
of
the
nobility
was
playing
cards
with
a
retired
actual
civil
councillor
and
a
rich
gentleman
,
the
owner
of
three
thousand
serfs
.
The
actual
civil
council-
lor
wore
on
his
first
finger
a
diamond
ring
,
spoke
very
slowly
and
always
kept
his
heels
together
and
his
feet
turned
out
in
the
position
affected
by
old-fashioned
dancers
;
he
never
turned
his
head
,
which
was
half
concealed
by
a
magnificent
velvet
collar
.
The
wealthy
gentle-
man
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
continually
laugh-
ing
,
raising
his
eyebrows
and
flashing
the
whites
of
his
eyes
.
The
poet
Bodryakov
,
a
man
of
clumsy
and
''
wild
appearance
,
was
talking
in
a
comer
with
the
learned
historian
Yevsyukov
;
they
were
holding
each
other
by
their
buttons
.
Near
them
one
gentleman
with
an
extraordinarily
long
waist
was
expounding
some
bold
opinions
to
another
gentleman
who
gazed
timidly
at
the
top
of
his
head
.
Mammas
in
various
coloured
caps
were
sitting
in
a
row
along
the
walls
;
at
the
doors
there
were
groups
of
gentlemen
of
a
humbler
sort
,
young
men
looking
embarrassed
,
older
men
looking
unassuming
;
but
there
is
no
describing
it
all
.
All
was
as
it
should
be
,
I
repeat
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
had
arrived
before
the
Ipatovs
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
saw
her
dancing
with
a
handsome
young
man
with
expressive
eyes
,
with
a
thin
black
moustache
and
shining
teeth
,
wearing
a
smart
dress-coat
and
a
gold
chain
hanging
in
a
semi-circle
on
his
waistcoat
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
was
dressed
in
blue
with
white
flowers
;
a
small
wreath
of
the
same
flowers
was
twisted
round
her
curly
hair
.
She
smiled
,
flirted
her
fan
and
looked
gaily
about
her
;
she
felt
herself
the
queen
of
the
ball
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
up
to
her
,
bowed
and
,
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
looking
at
her
affably
,
asked
her
whether
she
remembered
her
promise
of
yesterday
.
``
What
promise
?
''
``
You
are
dancing
the
mazurka
with
me
,
are
n't
you
?
''
``
Yes
,
of
course
,
''
The
young
man
who
was
standing
near
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
suddenly
turned
crimson
.
``
I
think
you
have
forgotten
,
Mademoiselle
,
''
he
began
,
``
that
you
had
promised
the
mazurka
to
me
.
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
was
confused
.
``
Oh
,
dear
,
what
am
I
to
do
?
''
she
said
:
'please
forgive
me
,
Monsieur
Steltchinsky
,
I
am
so
careless
:
I
am
really
so
ashamed
.
''
Monsieur
Steltchinsky
said
nothing
and
dropped
his
eyes
;
Vladimir
Sergeitch
drew
him-
self
up
slightly
.
``
Be
so
kind
,
Monsieur
Steltchinsky
,
''
Nad-
yezhda
Alexyevna
went
on
;
``
we
are
old
friends
while
Monsieur
Astahov
is
a
stranger
:
do
not
put
me
in
a
difficult
position
;
allow
me
to
dance
with
him
.
''
``
As
you
please
,
''
said
the
young
man
.
``
It's
for
you
to
begin
,
though
.
''
``
Thank
you
,
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
pro-
nounced
and
fluttered
off
to
meet
her
vis-a-vis
.
Steltchinsky
glanced
after
her
,
then
looked
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
in
his
turn
looked
at
him
and
walked
away
.
The
quadrille
was
soon
over
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
walked
up
and
down
the
ballroom
a
little
,
then
went
into
the
drawing-room
and
stopped
beside
one
of
the
card-tables
.
All
at
once
he
felt
someone
behind
him
touch
his
arm
;
he
turned
round
Steltchinsky
stood
before
him
.
``
I
want
a
couple
of
words
with
you
in
the
next
room
with
your
kind
permission
,
''
he
pro-
nounced
in
French
with
great
politeness
and
not
with
a
Russian
accent
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
followed
him
.
Steltchinsky
stopped
at
the
window
.
``
In
the
presence
of
a
lady
,
''
he
said
in
the
same
language
,
``
I
could
not
say
anything
but
what
I
did
;
but
you
do
not
,
I
hope
,
imagine
that
I
really
intend
to
surrender
to
you
my
right
to
dance
the
mazurka
with
Mile
.
Veretieff
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
surprised
.
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
he
asked
.
A
OUIET
BACKWATER
''
What
I
mean
,
'*
Steltchinsky
answered
calmly
,
his
nostrils
dilating
as
he
thrust
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat
,
``
is
that
I
do
n't
intend
to
,
that
's
all
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
thrust
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat
,
too
,
but
his
nostrils
did
not
dilate
.
``
Allow
me
to
observe
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
he
began
,
''
you
may
put
Mile
.
Verctieff
in
an
unpleasant
position
by
your
action
,
and
I
imagine
.
.
.
''
``
That
would
be
most
painful
to
me
,
but
no
one
hinders
you
from
withdrawing
,
declaring
yourself
unwell
or
going
away
.
.
.
''
``
I
am
not
going
to
do
that
.
What
do
you
take
me
for
?
''
``
In
that
case
I
shall
be
forced
to
ask
you
to
give
me
satisfaction
.
''
``
Satisfaction
...
in
what
sense
?
''
``
In
the
obvious
sense
.
''
``
You
are
challenging
me
to
a
duel
?
''
``
Certainly
,
if
you
do
not
give
up
the
ma-
zurka
.
''
Steltchinsky
tried
to
utter
these
words
in
the
most
unconcerned
manner
possible
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
heart
gave
a
jump
.
He
looked
into
the
face
of
his
unexpected
assailant
.
``
Good
Lord
,
''
he
thought
,
``
what
idiocy
!
''
THE
two
FRIENDS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
''
You
are
not
joking
?
''
he
said
aloud
.
``
It
is
not
my
habit
to
joke
,
''
Steltchinsky
replied
with
dignity
,
``
and
especially
with
per-
sons
with
whom
I
am
not
acquainted
.
You
will
not
give
up
the
mazurka
?
''
he
added
after
a
brief
pause
.
``
I
will
not
give
it
up
,
''
answered
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
as
though
reflecting
.
``
Very
good
!
We
will
fight
to-morrow
.
''
``
To-morrow
morning
my
second
will
call
on
you
.
''
And
with
a
polite
bow
Steltchinsky
re-
tired
,
evidently
very
well
pleased
with
himself
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
remained
a
few
moments
longer
at
the
window
.
``
Here
's
a
nice
business
,
''
he
thought
,
``
That's
what
comes
of
making
new
acquaintances
!
I
was
an
ass
to
come
!
Very
nice
!
Charming
!
''
He
pulled
himself
together
at
last
,
however
,
and
went
into
the
ballroom
.
There
they
were
already
dancing
the
polka
.
Marya
Pavlovna
flitted
by
him
dancing
with
Pyotr
Alexeitch
,
whom
he
had
not
noticed
till
then
;
she
looked
pale
and
even
melancholy
;
then
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
whirled
by
him
,
all
brightness
and
delight
,
with
a
little
bandy-legged
A
OUIEt
BACKWATER
but
ardent
artillery
officer
;
at
the
next
round
she
was
dancing
with
Steltchinsky
,
who
as
he
danced
kept
tossing
his
hair
back
.
``
Why
,
my
good
sir
,
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
heard
the
voice
of
Ipatov
behind
him
,
``
why
are
you
looking
on
and
not
dancing
?
Confess
now
,
though
we
do
live
,
so
to
say
,
in
a
quiet
back-
water
,
it
is
not
bad
here
,
is
it
?
''
``
Nice
sort
of
backwater
,
damn
it
!
''
thought
Valdimir
Sergeitch
,
and
muttering
some
sort
of
answer
to
Ipatov
he
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
ballroom
.
``
I
shall
have
to
find
a
second
,
''
he
thought
,
continuing
his
reflections
,
``
and
where
the
devil
am
I
to
find
him
?
Veretyev
is
out
of
the
question
;
I
do
n't
know
any
of
the
others
;
who
the
devil
would
have
thought
of
such
an
absurd
business
?
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
fond
of
mentioning
the
devil
when
he
was
vexed
.
At
that
moment
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
eyes
fell
on
the
Adjustable
Soul
,
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
who
was
standing
doing
nothing
by
the
window
.
``
Would
n't
he
do
?
''
he
thought
,
and
,
shrug-
ging
his
shoulders
,
he
added
almost
aloud
,
``
I
shall
have
to
ask
him
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
up
to
him
.
``
I
have
just
had
a
very
queer
adventure
,
''
our
hero
began
with
a
forced
smile
``
only
imagine
,
a
young
man
,
a
complete
stranger
,
has
just
challenged
me
to
a
duel
;
it
is
utterly
im-
possible
to
refuse
it
;
I
must
have
a
second
;
may
I
ask
you
?
''
Although
Ivan
Ilyitch
was
distinguished
,
as
the
reader
is
aware
,
by
imperturbable
indif-
ference
,
even
he
was
struck
by
so
unusual
a
suggestion
.
He
stared
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
in
perplexity
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
``
I
should
be
very
much
indebted
to
you
;
I
know
no
one
here
.
You
are
the
only
one
who
.
.
,
''
''
I
can
not
,
''
Ivan
Ilyitch
brought
out
as
though
waking
up
from
sleep
``
it
is
utterly
impos-
sible
.
''
``
Why
?
You
are
afraid
of
unpleasantness
;
but
I
hope
it
will
all
be
kept
secret
.
''
As
he
said
this
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
felt
that
he
flushed
and
was
confused
.
A
QUIET
BACKWATEIl
''
How
stupid
!
How
awfully
stupid
it
all
is
!
''
he
was
saying
inwardly
.
``
Excuse
me
,
I
ca
n't
possibly
,
''
repeated
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
shaking
his
head
and
drawing
back
,
up-
setting
a
chair
again
as
he
did
so
.
It
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
to
refuse
a
request
;
but
it
was
such
a
request
!
``
Anyway
,
''
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
in
an
agitated
voice
,
catching
hold
of
his
arm
,
``
you
will
do
me
the
favour
not
to
speak
to
anyone
of
what
I
have
told
you
,
I
beg
you
most
earnestly
.
''
``
That
I
can
do
,
that
I
can
do
,
''
Ivan
Ilyitch
replied
hurriedly
,
``
but
the
other
thing
I
ca
n't
,
say
what
you
like
,
I
am
not
equal
to
it
.
''
``
Very
well
,
very
well
,
''
said
Valdimir
Serge-
itch
,
``
but
do
n't
forget
that
I
count
upon
your
discretion
.
...
I
shall
inform
that
gentleman
to-morrow
,
''
he
muttered
to
himself
with
vexa-
tion
,
``
that
I
could
not
find
a
second
;
he
can
arrange
himself
as
he
likes
best
;
I
am
a
stranger
here
.
What
the
devil
possessed
me
to
apply
to
this
fellow
!
But
what
could
I
do
?
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
felt
very
,
very
much
put
out
.
Meanwhile
the
ball
went
on
.
He
felt
very
much
inclined
to
go
away
at
once
,
but
till
the
mazurka
was
over
going
away
was
not
to
be
thought
of
.
How
could
he
let
his
opponent
triumph
?
Unluckily
for
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
was
a
free-and-
easy
young
man
with
long
hair
and
a
hollow
chest
,
over
which
a
black
satin
cravat
,
with
a
huge
gold
pin
in
it
,
flowed
like
a
small
water-
fall
.
This
young
man
had
the
reputation
all
over
the
province
of
being
completely
versed
in
all
the
customs
and
traditions
of
the
highest
society
,
though
he
had
only
spent
six
months
in
Petersburg
and
had
not
succeeded
in
pene-
trating
into
anything
higher
than
the
houses
of
the
collegiate
councillor
Sandaraki
and
his
son-in-law
,
the
civil
councillor
,
Kostandaraki
:
he
led
the
dances
at
every
ball
,
signalled
to
the
musicians
by
clapping
his
hands
;
in
the
midst
of
the
blare
of
the
trumpets
and
the
scraping
of
the
fiddles
shouted
,
``
En
avant
deux
!
''
or
''
Grande
chainc
''
or
``
A
vous
,
mademoiselle
,
''
and
pale
and
perspiring
,
kept
flying
about
,
glid-
ing
and
scraping
on
the
floor
.
He
never
be-
gan
the
mazurka
before
midnight
.
``
And
that's
A
QUlEt
BACKWATER
something
to
be
thankful
for
,
''
he
would
say
;
*'in
Petersburg
I
should
have
kept
you
waiting
for
it
till
two
o'clock
.
''
The
ball
seemed
long
tq
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
He
wandered
like
a
shadow
from
the
ballroom
to
the
drawing-room
,
from
time
to
time
ex-
changing
frigid
glances
with
his
rival
,
who
did
not
miss
a
single
dance
,
asked
Marya
Pavlovna
for
a
quadrille
,
but
she
was
engaged
and
once
or
twice
said
a
few
words
to
his
solicitous
host
who
seemed
troubled
by
the
look
of
boredom
on
the
face
of
his
new
acquaintance
.
At
last
the
strains
of
the
longed-for
mazurka
were
heard
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
sought
out
his
partner
,
brought
two
chairs
and
sat
with
her
among
the
last
couples
,
almost
facing
Steltchinsky
.
As
was
to
be
expected
,
the
young
leader
of
the
dances
was
the
first
to
begin
.
His
counte-
nance
as
he
began
the
mazurka
,
the
way
he
drew
his
partner
after
him
,
while
he
struck
the
floor
with
his
foot
and
tossed
his
head
to
de-
scribe
all
this
is
almost
beyond
the
pen
of
man
.
``
I
think
you
are
bored
.
Monsieur
Astahov
,
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
began
,
addressing
Vladi-
mir
Sergeitch
.
``
I
?
Not
in
the
least
.
What
makes
you
think
so
?
''
``
Why
,
from
your
expression
.
.
.
.
You
have
not
smiled
once
since
you
came
in
.
I
did
not
expect
that
of
you
.
It
does
n't
suit
you
,
prac-
tical
gentlemen
,
to
scowl
and
be
unsociable
d
la
Byron
leave
that
to
the
poets
.
''
``
I
notice
,
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
,
that
you
frequently
call
me
a
practical
person
by
way
of
mocking
at
me
.
I
suppose
you
look
upon
me
as
a
cold
and
very
sensible
being
,
not
capa-
ble
of
anything
.
But
do
you
know
what
I
can
tell
you
:
a
practical
person
may
often
feel
any-
thing
but
light-hearted
,
though
he
does
not
think
it
necessary
to
display
to
others
what
is
passing
within
him
;
he
prefers
to
be
silent
!
''
``
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
''
asked
Nad-
yezhda
Alexyevna
with
a
glance
at
him
.
``
Nothing
,
''
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
with
af-
fected
indifference
,
and
he
assumed
a
mysteri-
ous
air
.
``
But
still
?
''
``
Nothing
,
really
.
.
.
.
One
day
you
will
know
,
later
.
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
would
have
pursued
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
her
questions
but
at
that
instant
a
young
lady
,
the
daughter
of
the
host
,
led
up
to
her
Stelt-
chinsky
and
another
gentleman
in
blue
spec-
tacles
.
``
Life
or
death
?
''
she
asked
in
French
.
``
Life
,
''
cried
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
,
``
I
don't
want
death
yet
.
''
Steltchinsky
bowed
and
led
her
off
.
The
gentleman
in
blue
spectacles
referred
to
as
death
led
off
the
daughter
of
the
house
.
Both
names
had
been
suggested
by
Steltchinsky
.
``
Tell
me
,
please
,
who
is
this
Mr.
Steltchin-
sky
?
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
asked
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
as
soon
as
the
latter
came
back
to
her
seat
.
``
He
is
in
the
Governor
's
service
,
a
very
agreeable
young
man
.
He
does
not
belong
here
.
He
is
rather
a
coxcomb
but
that
's
in
their
blood
.
I
hope
you
have
not
had
any
dif-
ficulties
with
him
about
the
mazurka
?
''
``
Not
the
slightest
,
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
re-
plied
with
some
hesitation
.
``
I
am
so
forgetful
!
You
ca
n't
imagine
.
''
``
I
ought
to
rejoice
in
your
f
orgetfulness
:
it
has
given
me
the
pleasure
of
dancing
with
you
this
evening
.
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
looked
at
him
,
slightly
screwing
up
her
eyes
:
''
Really
?
You
are
glad
to
dance
with
me
?
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
responded
with
a
com-
pliment
.
Little
by
little
he
began
talking
freely
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
was
always
very
charming
,
and
was
especially
so
that
eve-
ning
;
Vladimir
Sergeitch
thought
her
delight-
ful
.
The
thought
of
the
duel
next
day
,
work-
ing
upon
his
nerves
,
gave
brilHance
and
live-
liness
to
his
talk
;
under
the
influence
of
it
he
allowed
himself
some
exaggeration
in
the
ex-
pression
of
his
feelings
.
.
.
``
Well
,
come
what
may
!
''
In
all
his
words
,
in
his
stifled
sighs
,
in
the
sudden
gloom
that
from
time
to
time
clouded
his
face
,
there
was
something
of
mys-
tery
,
of
involuntary
sadness
and
picturesque
despair
.
He
unbent
at
last
,
so
far
as
to
be
talking
of
love
,
of
women
,
of
his
future
,
of
his
conception
of
happiness
and
of
what
he
asked
of
fate
.
.
.
.
He
expressed
himself
in-
directly
,
in
hints
.
On
the
eve
of
possible
death
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Vladimir
Sergeitch
flirted
with
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
.
She
listened
to
him
attentively
,
laughed
,
shook
her
head
,
sometimes
disputed
with
him
,
some-
times
pretended
to
be
incredulous
.
.
.
.
The
conversation
,
frequently
interrupted
by
the
other
dances
,
took
at
last
a
rather
strange
turn
.
.
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
questioning
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
about
herself
,
about
her
character
,
about
her
tastes
.
...
At
first
she
turned
off
his
questions
with
a
jest
,
then
sud-
denly
to
his
surprise
asked
him
when
he
was
going
away
.
``
Where
?
''
he
asked
,
wondering
.
``
Home
.
''
``
To
Sasovo
?
''
``
No
,
home
,
to
your
estate
,
seventy
miles
away
?
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
dropped
his
eyes
.
``
I
should
like
it
to
be
as
soon
as
possible
,
''
he
brought
out
with
a
troubled
face
.
``
I
ex-
pect
,
to-morrow
...
if
I
am
still
living
.
I
have
business
,
you
know
.
But
what
makes
you
ask
me
about
it
?
''
``
Oil
,
nothing
,
''
answered
Nadyezhda
Alex-
yevna
.
``
What
was
the
reason
,
though
?
''
``
Nothing
,
''
she
repeated
.
``
I
am
surprised
at
the
curiosity
of
a
man
who
is
going
away
to-morrow
,
and
to-day
cares
to
find
out
what
I
am
like
.
''
``
But
really
.
.
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
beginning
.
``
Oh
,
this
is
appropriate
.
.
.
read
this
,
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
interrupted
him
with
a
laugh
,
handing
him
the
paper
from
a
sweet
which
she
had
just
picked
up
from
a
little
table
,
and
she
got
up
to
meet
Marya
Pavlovna
,
who
had
come
up
to
her
with
another
lady
.
Marya
Pavlovna
was
dancing
with
Pyotr
Alexeitch
.
Her
face
was
flushed
and
heated
but
did
not
look
any
happier
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
looked
at
the
paper
on
it
was
printed
in
inferior
French
type
:
Qui
me
neglige
me
perd
.
He
looked
up
and
caught
Steltchinsky
's
eyes
fixed
upon
him
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
gave
a
forced
smile
,
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
back
of
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
a
chair
and
crossed
his
legs
,
as
though
to
say
,
''
So
much
for
you
!
''
The
ardent
artillery
officer
whirled
Nad-
yezhda
Alexyevna
back
to
her
seat
,
slowly
ro-
tated
with
her
in
front
of
it
,
made
a
bow
,
clanked
his
spurs
and
departed
.
She
sat
down
.
``
Allow
me
to
ask
,
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
be-
gan
deliberately
,
``
how
am
I
to
take
that
motto
?
''
``
What
was
it
?
''
said
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
.
``
Oh
,
yes
!
Qui
yne
neglige
me
perd
.
Why
!
It
is
an
excellent
practical
rule
which
may
apply
at
every
turn
.
To
succeed
in
any
pursuit
one
must
neglect
nothing
.
.
.
.
One
must
try
for
all
and
perhaps
one
will
get
something
.
But
it
's
funny
:
here
am
I
,
I
.
.
.
giving
good
advice
to
a
practical
person
like
you
.
''
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
laughed
and
for
the
rest
of
the
mazurka
Vladimir
Sergeitch
tried
in
vain
to
go
back
to
the
previous
conversation
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
turned
it
off
with
the
wilfulness
of
a
capricious
child
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
talked
to
her
of
her
feelings
and
she
either
refrained
from
answering
him
altogether
or
drew
his
attention
to
the
dresses
of
the
ladies
,
to
the
absurd
faces
of
some
of
the
men
,
to
the
perfection
of
her
brother
's
dancing
,
to
the
beauty
of
Marya
Pavlovna
;
she
talked
about
music
,
of
what
they
had
done
the
day
before
,
of
Yegor
Kapitonitch
and
his
wife
Matryona
Markovna
.
.
.
and
only
at
the
very
end
of
the
mazurka
when
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
be-
ginning
to
make
his
last
bows
she
said
with
an
ironical
smile
on
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
:
''
And
so
you
really
are
going
away
to-mor-
row
?
''
``
Yes
;
and
perhaps
for
a
long
journey
,
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
said
significantly
.
``
I
wish
you
bon
voyage
.
''
And
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
went
quickly
to
her
brother
,
whis-
pered
something
gaily
in
his
ear
,
then
asked
aloud
:
''
Are
you
grateful
to
me
?
Yes
?
Aren't
you
?
But
for
me
he
would
have
asked
her
for
the
mazurka
.
''
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
:
''
It
will
lead
to
nothing
,
anyway
.
''
She
led
him
into
the
drawing-room
.
``
The
flirt
!
''
thought
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
and
,
picking
up
his
hat
,
he
slipped
unnoticed
out
of
S28
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
the
ballroom
,
found
his
groom
whom
he
had
told
to
be
in
readiness
and
was
putting
on
his
overcoat
when
to
his
extreme
astonishment
,
his
groom
told
him
that
they
could
not
go
,
that
the
coachman
had
somehow
succeeded
in
getting
drunk
and
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
wak-
ing
him
,
-
Swearing
very
briefly
but
very
ex-
pressively
at
the
absent
coachman
(
there
were
other
people
in
the
hall
)
,
and
telling
the
groom
that
if
the
coachman
were
not
in
a
fit
state
by
the
early
morning
no
one
in
the
world
could
imagine
what
the
consequences
would
be
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
back
to
the
ballroom
and
asked
the
butler
to
give
him
a
bedroom
without
waiting
for
the
supper
which
was
being
laid
in
the
drawing-room
.
The
master
of
the
house
seemed
suddenly
to
spring
out
of
the
floor
just
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
elbow
(
Gav-
ril
Stepanitch
wore
boots
without
heels
and
so
moved
about
noiselessly
)
and
began
persuad-
ing
him
to
remain
,
telling
him
that
at
supper
there
would
be
some
first-rate
caviare
;
but
Vladimir
Sergeitch
refused
,
saying
he
had
a
headache
.
Half
an
hour
later
he
was
lying
on
a
small
bed
under
a
short
quilt
,
trying
to
go
to
sleep
.
But
he
could
not
sleep
though
he
tossed
from
side
to
side
,
though
he
tried
to
think
of
something
else
,
the
figure
of
Steltchinsky
per-
sisted
in
haunting
him
.
.
.
.
Now
he
was
aim-
ing
.
.
.
.
Now
he
was
firing
.
.
.
.
``
Astahov
is
killed
,
''
someone
was
saying
.
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
could
not
be
called
valiant
though
he
was
not
a
coward
,
either
;
but
the
idea
of
fighting
a
duel
with
anyone
had
never
entered
his
head
.
.
.
.
The
notion
of
fighting
with
his
good
sense
,
peaceable
disposition
,
regard
for
propri-
ety
,
dreams
of
future
prosperity
and
making
a
good
marriage
!
If
he
had
not
been
the
per-
son
concerned
,
he
would
have
burst
out
laugh-
ing
,
the
whole
business
struck
him
as
so
ludi-
crous
and
absurd
.
To
fight
!
And
with
whom
and
for
what
?
``
Damn
it
all
!
What
nonsense
!
''
he
uncon-
sciously
exclaimed
aloud
,
``
well
,
and
if
he
really
does
kill
me
,
''
he
continued
his
meditations
,
``
I
must
take
measures
anyway
and
make
arrange-
ments
.
.
.
.
Will
anyone
regret
me
?
''
And
with
vexation
he
closed
his
wide-open
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
eyes
,
drew
the
quilt
up
to
his
neck
.
.
.
but
still
could
not
sleep
.
>
There
was
a
faint
flush
of
dawn
in
the
sky
and
,
worn
out
with
feverish
sleeplessness
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
dropping
into
a
doze
when
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
a
weight
on
his
feet
.
He
opened
his
eyes
.
.
.
Veretyev
was
sitting
on
his
bed
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
extremely
surprised
,
especially
when
he
noticed
that
Veretyev
had
no
coat
on
,
that
his
shirt
was
unbuttoned
and
his
bare
chest
was
visible
,
that
his
hair
was
falling
over
his
forehead
and
that
his
face
,
too
,
looked
changed
,
and
Vladimir
Sergeitch
sat
up
in
bed
.
``
May
I
ask
.
.
.
''
he
began
with
a
gesture
of
surprise
.
``
I
have
come
to
see
you
,
''
Veretyev
began
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
``
in
this
condition
,
excuse
me
.
.
.
.
We
had
a
little
drink
...
I
wanted
to
re-
assure
you
.
I
said
to
myself
:
there
's
a
gen-
tleman
in
bed
up
there
who
probably
ca
n't
sleep
let
us
come
to
his
aid
!
Take
note
:
you
are
not
going
to
fight
to-morrow
and
you
can
sleep
.
...
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
more
surprised
than
ever
.
``
What
did
you
say
?
''
he
muttered
.
``
Yes
,
it
is
all
settled
,
''
Veretyev
went
on
,
''
that
gentleman
from
the
shores
of
the
Vistula
.
.
.
Steltchinsky
.
.
.
apologises
to
you
.
.
.
you
will
get
a
letter
from
him
to-morrow
.
.
.
I
tell
you
again
,
it
's
all
over
.
.
.
.
You
can
snore
!
''
And
saying
this
,
Veretyev
got
up
and
made
unsteadily
for
the
door
,
''
But
excuse
me
,
excuse
me
,
''
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
began
,
``
how
did
you
find
out
,
and
how
can
I
believe
.
.
.
''
``
Ah
!
You
think
that
I
am
.
.
.
h
'm
!
(
and
he
gave
a
slight
lurch
forward
)
.
I
tell
you
...
he
will
send
you
a
letter
to-morrow
.
.
.
.
You
do
n't
attract
me
particularly
but
generosity
is
my
weak
point
.
And
what
's
the
good
of
talking
?
.
.
.
It
's
all
such
nonsense
.
.
.
.
But
confess
,
''
he
added
with
a
wink
,
``
you
were
a
Httle
scared
,
were
n't
you
?
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
angry
.
``
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
''
he
said
.
``
Oh
,
all
right
,
all
right
,
''
Veretyev
interrupted
?
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
with
a
good-natured
smile
.
``
Do
n't
get
excited
.
You
do
n't
know
that
we
never
have
a
ball
with-
out
an
incident
of
this
sort
.
.
.
.
It
's
the
regu-
lar
thing
.
It
never
leads
to
anything
.
As
though
anyone
wants
to
make
a
target
of
him-
self
!
But
why
not
show
off
a
bit
to
a
new-
comer
,
for
instance
?
In
vino
Veritas
.
Though
neither
you
nor
I
know
Latin
.
But
I
see
from
your
appearance
that
you
are
sleepy
.
I
wish
you
a
good-night
,
you
practical
person
and
well-intentioned
mortal
.
Accept
that
wish
from
another
mortal
who
is
not
worth
a
half-
penny
.
Addio
,
niio
caro
!
''
x
And
Veretyev
went
away
.
``
What
on
earth
is
the
meaning
of
it
?
''
ex-
claimed
Vladimir
Sergeitch
a
little
later
,
and
he
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
pillow
.
``
It's
beyond
everything
!
...
It
must
be
explained
!
I
wo
n't
put
up
with
it
!
''
For
all
that
,
five
minutes
later
he
was
in
a
quiet
,
sound
sleep
.
His
heart
was
lighter
.
.
.
.
A
danger
passed
softens
and
fills
with
sweetness
the
heart
of
man
.
This
is
what
had
happened
before
Veretyev's
sudden
interview
with
Vladimir
Sergeitch
in
the
night
,
Gavril
Stepanitch
had
a
second
cousin
,
a
bachelor
,
living
in
his
house
.
When
there
were
balls
young
men
would
run
down
to
his
room
on
the
ground
floor
to
smoke
in
the
intervals
between
the
dances
,
and
after
supper
they
as-
sembled
there
for
a
friendly
drink
.
On
that
night
a
good
many
guests
had
gathered
together
in
his
room
.
Steltchinsky
and
Veretyev
were
among
them
;
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
the
Adjustable
Soul
,
had
strolled
down
there
also
.
They
mixed
punch
.
Though
Ivan
Ilyitch
had
promised
Astahov
to
say
nothing
about
the
approaching
duel
,
yet
when
Veretyev
casually
asked
him
what
he
had
been
talking
about
to
that
muff
(
Veretyev
always
spoke
of
Astahov
in
this
way
)
,
the
Adjustable
Soul
could
not
refrain
from
repeating
his
conversation
with
Vladimir
Sergeitch
word
for
word
.
Veretyev
laughed
,
then
grew
thoughtful
.
``
But
whom
is
he
fighting
with
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Well
,
that
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
''
answered
Ivan
Ilyitch
.
``
Whom
was
he
talking
to
,
anyway
?
''
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
''
With
different
people
.
.
.
Yegor
Kapiton-
itch
surely
he
is
not
fighting
with
him
?
''
Veretyev
walked
away
from
Ivan
Ilyitch
.
And
so
the
punch
was
made
and
they
began
drinking
it
.
Veretyev
was
sitting
in
the
most
conspicuous
place
;
gay
and
reckless
,
he
took
the
lead
in
all
young
men
's
parties
.
He
flung
off
his
coat
and
cravat
.
He
was
asked
to
sing
;
he
took
the
guitar
and
sang
several
songs
.
The
wine
began
to
go
to
their
heads
;
the
young
men
began
drinking
toasts
.
Steltchinsky
,
with
a
flushed
face
,
suddenly
leaped
onto
the
table
and
,
holding
his
glass
high
above
his
head
,
cried
aloud
:
''
To
the
health
of
I
know
whom
,
''
he
added
hurriedly
;
he
drank
off
the
wine
,
dashed
the
glass
to
the
floor
and
went
on
:
``
May
my
enemy
be
smashed
to
fragments
like
this
to-
morrow
Veretyev
,
who
had
been
watching
him
for
some
time
,
raised
his
head
quickly
.
``
Steltchinsky
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
begin
with
,
get
off
that
table
,
it
's
unseemly
;
besides
,
your
boots
are
nothing
to
boast
of
.
And
then
come
here
;
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
''
He
drew
him
aside
.
``
Listen
,
my
boy
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
know
you
are
going
to
fight
to-morrow
with
that
Peters-
burg
gentleman
.
''
Steltchinsky
started
.
``
How
.
.
.
who
told
you
?
''
``
I
tell
you
.
And
I
know
whom
you
are
fighting
about
,
too
.
''
``
Who
is
it
?
It
would
be
interesting
to
know
that
.
''
``
Oh
,
what
a
Talleyrand
!
Why
,
about
my
sister
,
of
course
.
Come
,
come
,
do
n't
pretend
to
be
surprised
.
It
makes
you
look
like
a
goose
.
I
ca
n't
imagine
how
it
came
about
,
but
I
know
it
is
so
.
Come
,
my
boy
,
''
\'eretyev
went
on
,
``
what
's
the
use
of
pretending
?
I
know
you
've
been
paying
her
attention
for
a
long
time
.
''
``
But
that
proves
nothing
.
''
``
Leave
off
,
please
.
But
listen
to
what
I
am
going
to
say
to
you
.
I
wo
n't
allow
this
duel
on
any
account
.
Do
you
understand
that
?
All
this
folly
will
recoil
on
my
sister
.
Ex-
cuse
me
,
but
as
long
as
I
am
alive
...
I
will
not
allow
it
.
If
you
and
I
go
to
ruin
,
that's
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
what
we
deserve
,
but
she
ought
to
have
a
long
life
and
a
happy
one
.
Yes
,
I
swear
,
''
he
added
with
sudden
heat
,
``
I
would
betray
everyone
else
,
even
those
who
are
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
me
,
but
I
wo
n't
let
anyone
touch
her
.
''
Steltchinsky
gave
a
forced
laugh
,
''
You
are
drunk
,
my
dear
fellow
,
and
rav-
ing
..
.
that
's
all
.
''
``
And
are
n't
you
?
But
whether
I
am
drunk
or
not
does
not
matter
.
I
am
talking
sense
.
You
will
not
fight
with
that
gentleman
,
that
I
can
guarantee
.
What
possessed
you
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
?
Were
you
jealous
,
or
what
?
How
true
it
is
that
people
are
fools
when
they
are
in
love
!
Why
,
she
only
danced
with
him
to
prevent
him
from
asking
.
.
.
.
But
that
's
not
the
point
.
The
duel
will
not
come
off
.
''
``
H
'm
!
I
should
like
to
know
how
you
are
going
to
prevent
me
?
''
''
''
Why
,
like
this
if
you
wo
n't
promise
this
minute
to
give
up
this
duel
,
I
will
fight
you
myself
.
''
``
Indeed
?
''
``
My
dear
fellow
,
do
n't
doubt
it
.
I
will
in-
sult
you
in
the
most
original
way
imaginable
before
everyone
this
minute
and
then
we
will
fight
across
a
handkerchief
if
you
like
.
But
I
imagine
this
would
not
be
to
your
liking
for
several
reasons
,
would
it
?
''
Steltchinsky
fired
up
,
began
to
say
that
this
was
intimidation
,
that
he
would
allow
no
one
to
interfere
in
his
private
affairs
,
that
he
should
consider
nothing
.
.
,
and
ended
by
giving
way
and
renouncing
all
attempts
on
the
life
of
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
Veretyev
embraced
him
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
were
for
the
tenth
time
drinking
Brilderschaft
;
that
is
,
drinking
with
arms
interlocked
.
.
.
.
The
young
leader
of
the
dance
drank
Briiderschaft
with
them
,
too
,
and
at
first
kept
pace
with
them
but
at
last
fell
asleep
in
the
most
innocent
way
and
lay
for
a
long
time
on
his
back
in
a
con-
dition
of
complete
unconsciousness
.
The
ex-
pression
of
his
little
pale
face
was
both
pathetic
and
amusing
.
.
.
.
Good
heavens
,
what
would
the
society
ladies
of
his
ac-
quaintance
have
said
,
if
they
had
seen
him
in
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
sucS
d
sorry
plight
!
But
fortunately
he
did
not
know
any
society
ladies
.
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
too
,
distinguished
himself
that
night
.
To
begin
with
,
he
astonished
the
assem-
bled
gentlemen
by
suddenly
striking
up
:
''
Once
upon
a
time
a
baron
.
.
.
''
``
The
hawfinch
!
The
hawfinch
is
singing
!
''
they
all
shouted
.
``
The
hawfinch
never
sings
at
night
!
''
``
As
though
I
only
knew
one
song
!
''
retorted
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
excited
by
the
wine
.
``
I
know
others
,
too
.
''
``
All
right
,
show
us
your
talents
!
''
Ivan
Ilyitch
was
silent
for
a
space
and
then
began
in
a
bass
voice
``
Krambambuli
,
the
home
of
my
fathers
,
''
but
so
queerly
and
out
of
tune
that
a
general
shout
of
laughter
drowned
his
voice
and
he
subsided
.
When
the
party
broke
up
,
Veretyev
went
to
see
Vladimir
Sergeitch
and
the
brief
conversa-
tion
we
have
described
already
took
place
be-
tween
them
.
Very
early
the
next
day
Vladimir
Sergeitch
set
off
for
Sasovo
.
He
spent
the
whole
mom-
ing
in
agitation
,
almost
mistook
a
merchant
who
called
on
him
for
a
second
,
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
the
footman
brought
him
a
letter
from
Steltchinsky
.
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
read
the
letter
through
several
times
it
was
very
cleverly
written
.
Steltchinsky
began
with
the
words
la
nuit
parte
con
sell
.
Monsieur
and
did
not
apologise
,
since
in
his
opinion
he
had
not
insulted
his
opponent
in
any
way
;
at
the
same
time
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
been
too
hasty
the
evening
before
and
con-
cluded
by
saying
that
he
was
completely
at
the
service
de
M-r
Astakhof
,
but
for
himself
no
longer
desired
satisfaction
.
After
writing
and
dispatching
a
reply
filled
with
a
courtesy
that
almost
approached
mockery
and
a
feeling
of
dignity
which
did
not
,
however
,
show
a
trace
of
boastfulness
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
sat
down
to
his
dinner
rubbing
his
hands
,
ate
it
with
great
relish
,
and
immediately
after
it
set
off
to
his
own
home
,
without
having
even
sent
a
change
of
horses
in
advance
.
The
road
by
which
he
drove
lay
within
three
miles
of
Ipatov
's
house
.
.
.
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
gazed
at
it
.
``
Farewell
,
quiet
backwater
!
''
he
muttered
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
ironically
.
The
figures
of
Nadyezhda
Alex-
yevna
and
Marya
Pavlovna
flitted
for
a
mo-
ment
before
his
imagination
;
he
waved
them
off
,
turned
away
and
fell
into
a
doze
.
CHAPTER
VI
Over
three
months
passed
.
The
autumn
was
far
advanced
;
the
yellow
woods
were
losing
their
last
leaves
,
the
blue-tits
had
arrived
and
,
sure
sign
of
the
approach
of
winter
,
the
wind
was
beginning
to
groan
and
howl
.
But
there
had
not
yet
been
much
rain
,
and
the
mud
on
the
roads
was
not
yet
very
sloppy
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
took
advantage
of
this
circumstance
to
visit
the
chief
town
of
the
province
in
or-
der
to
conclude
some
business
transactions
.
He
spent
the
morning
driving
from
one
place
to
another
,
and
in
the
evening
went
to
the
club
.
He
met
several
acquaintances
in
the
big
,
gloomy
clubroom
,
among
them
an
old
retired
cavalry
officer
.
Flitch
,
whom
everyone
knew
as
a
capable
business
man
,
a
wit
,
a
cardplayer
and
a
gossip
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
got
into
con-
versation
with
him
.
``
Oh
,
by
the
way
,
''
Flitch
exclaimed
sud-
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
denly
,
``
a
lady
you
know
was
passing
through
the
town
the
other
day
and
she
sent
you
her
greetings
.
''
``
What
lady
?
''
``
Madame
Steltchinsky
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
any
Madame
Steltchinsky
.
''
``
You
knew
her
before
she
was
married
.
.
.
.
Her
maiden
name
was
Veretyev
.
.
.
Nad-
yezhda
Alexyevna
.
Her
husband
was
in
our
Governor
's
service
.
You
must
have
seen
him
,
too
.
...
A
lively
fellow
,
with
a
little
mous-
tache
.
He
has
hooked
an
attractive
little
party
,
and
with
money
,
too
.
''
``
You
do
n't
say
so
I
''
said
Vladimir
vSergeitch
.
``
So
she
has
married
him
.
.
.
.
H
'm
!
And
where
was
she
going
?
''
``
To
Petersburg
.
She
told
me
to
remind
you
about
some
motto
.
.
.
.
What
was
it
,
if
I
may
be
so
inquisitive
?
''
And
the
old
gossip
's
sharp
nose
looked
alert
with
expectation
.
``
I
do
n't
remember
,
really
,
some
joke
,
''
re-
plied
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
And
where
is
her
brother
,
may
I
ask
?
''
``
Pyotr
?
Oh
,
he
is
in
a
bad
way
.
''
Mr.
Flitch
turned
up
his
fox-hke
little
eyes
and
heaved
a
sigh
.
``
How
so
?
''
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
He
's
gone
to
the
dogs
!
He
is
on
the
road
to
ruin
,
''
''
Where
is
he
now
,
then
?
''
``
Nobody
knows
.
He
is
gone
off
after
some
gipsy
girls
,
that
's
the
most
likely
story
.
He
is
not
in
the
province
,
that
I
can
answer
for
.
''
``
And
old
Ipatov
,
is
he
still
living
there
?
''
``
Mihail
Nikolaitch
?
The
queer
little
chap
,
you
mean
?
He
is
still
there
.
''
``
And
is
everyone
in
his
house
...
as
be-
fore
?
''
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
.
How
would
it
be
for
you
to
marry
his
sister-in-law
?
She
is
a
regular
piece
of
antique
sculpture
,
is
n't
she
?
He-he
!
People
did
say
,
you
know
.
.
.
''
``
Really
,
''
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
screwing
up
his
eyelids
.
At
that
moment
Flitch
was
invited
to
a
game
of
cards
and
the
conversation
dropped
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
had
intended
to
return
home
quickly
but
a
messenger
arrived
from
the
village
elder
at
Sasovo
telling
him
that
six
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
peasant
homesteads
had
been
burnt
to
the
ground
,
and
he
decided
to
go
down
himself
.
It
was
reckoned
about
forty
miles
from
the
town
to
Sasovo
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
reached
that
evening
the
little
lodge
with
which
the
reader
is
already
familiar
,
at
once
summoned
the
village
elder
and
the
rural
clerk
,
duly
up-
braided
them
,
went
in
the
morning
to
inspect
the
scene
of
the
fire
,
directed
that
various
steps
should
be
taken
,
and
when
he
had
dined
,
de-
cided
,
after
a
brief
hesitation
,
to
pay
a
call
on
Ipatov
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
would
have
stayed
at
home
if
he
had
not
heard
from
Flitch
that
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
had
left
the
neighbour-
hood
.
He
did
not
want
to
meet
her
again
;
but
he
felt
no
disinclination
to
have
another
look
at
Marya
Pavlovna
.
As
on
his
first
visit
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
found
Ipatov
playing
draughts
with
the
Ad-
justable
Soul
.
The
old
man
was
delighted
to
see
him
;
Vladimir
Sergeitch
fancied
,
however
,
that
his
face
was
careworn
,
and
his
words
did
not
flow
with
the
same
readiness
as
of
old
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
exchanged
silent
glances
with
Ivan
Ilyitch
.
They
both
feh
a
twinge
of
discomfort
;
but
they
soon
got
over
it
.
``
Are
all
your
household
well
?
''
inquired
Vladimir
Sergeitch
as
he
sat
down
.
``
They
are
all
quite
well
,
thank
you
,
''
an-
swered
Ipatov
.
``
Only
Marya
Pavlovna
is
not
quite
the
thing
.
.
.
she
keeps
to
her
room
for
the
most
part
now
.
''
``
Has
she
got
a
cold
?
''
``
No
.
.
.
not
exactly
,
She
will
come
in
to
tea
.
''
``
And
Yegor
Kapitonitch
?
How
is
he
get-
ting
on
?
''
``
Ah
,
it
is
all
over
with
Yegor
Kapitonitch
.
His
wife
is
dead
.
''
``
Impossible
!
''
``
She
died
after
twenty-four
hours
'
illness
of
cholera
.
You
would
n't
know
him
now
,
he
is
not
like
himself
.
'Without
Matryona
Mark-
ovna
life
is
a
burden
to
me
.
I
shall
die
,
'
he
says
,
'and
thank
Godj
I
do
n't
care
to
live
,
'
he
says
.
Yes
,
the
poor
fellow
is
quite
lost
.
''
``
Oh
,
dear
,
how
unfortunate
!
''
cried
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
Poor
Yegor
Kapitonitch
!
``
-
Everyone
was
silent
for
a
space
,
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
''
I
hear
your
neighbour
is
married
,
''
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
flushing
sHghtly
.
``
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
?
Yes
,
she
is
mar-
ried
.
''
Ipatov
stole
a
side-long
glance
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
Yes
.
.
.
yes
,
she
is
married
and
gone
away
.
''
``
To
Petersburg
?
''
``
To
Petersburg
.
''
``
I
expect
Marya
Pavlovna
misses
her
?
I
think
they
were
great
friends
.
''
``
Of
course
she
misses
her
.
That
ca
n't
be
helped
.
Though
as
for
her
friendship
,
I
can
assure
you
young
ladies
'
friendship
is
worse
than
men
's
.
It
's
all
right
while
they
are
to-
gether
,
but
out
of
sight
is
out
of
mind
.
''
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
``
Yes
,
indeed
.
Take
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
,
for
instance
.
We
have
not
had
one
letter
from
her
since
she
went
away
,
and
the
promises
she
made
,
the
vows
!
No
doubt
she
has
other
things
to
think
of
now
.
''
``
Has
she
been
gone
long
?
''
``
It
must
be
six
weeks
.
She
galloped
off
the
day
after
the
wedding
,
in
foreign
style
.
''
``
They
say
her
brother
is
not
here
,
either
?
''
said
Vladimir*
Sergeitch
a
little
later
.
``
Yes
,
he
is
gone
,
too
.
You
see
,
they
are
city
people
;
they
are
not
Hkely
to
stay
long
in
the
country
!
''
``
And
do
n't
you
know
where
he
has
gone
?
''
``
No
.
''
``
He
is
here
to-day
and
gone
to-morrow
,
''
observed
Ivan
Ilyitch
.
``
He
is
here
to-day
and
gone
to-morrow
,
''
re-
peated
Ipatov
.
``
And
you
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
what
good
news
is
there
of
you
?
''
he
added
,
turning
round
in
his
chair
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
telling
about
him-
self
.
Ipatov
listened
listened
and
exclaimed
at
last
:
''
But
why
does
n't
Masha
come
?
Ivan
Ily-
itch
,
you
might
go
and
fetch
her
.
''
Ivan
Ilyitch
went
out
of
the
room
and
re-
turning
,
announced
that
Marya
Pavlovna
was
just
coming
.
``
Has
she
a
headache
?
''
Ipatov
asked
in
a
low
voice
.
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Ivan
Ilyitch
.
The
door
opened
and
Marya
Pavlovna
came
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
in
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
got
up
,
bowed
and
was
so
amazed
that
he
could
not
utter
a
word
:
so
changed
was
Marya
Pavlovna
since
he
had
seen
her
last
!
All
the
colour
had
gone
from
her
wan
cheeks
;
there
were
wide
,
dark
rings
round
her
eyes
;
there
was
a
look
of
grief
about
her
tightly
set
lips
;
her
whole
face
,
dark
and
immovable
,
seemed
turned
to
stone
.
She
lifted
her
eyes
and
there
was
no
light
in
them
.
``
How
do
you
feel
?
''
Ipatov
asked
her
.
``
I
am
quite
well
,
''
she
answered
,
and
sat
down
to
the
table
on
which
a
samovar
was
al-
ready
boiling
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
pretty
thoroughly
bored
that
evening
;
and
indeed
everyone
was
depressed
.
The
conversation
was
continually
taking
a
melancholy
turn
.
``
Hark
,
what
a
tune
it
's
playing
!
''
Ipatov
said
,
among
other
things
,
listening
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
.
``
Summer
has
long
past
;
the
autumn
is
passing
,
too
,
and
winter
is
upon
us
.
The
snowdrifts
will
lie
about
us
again
.
If
only
the
snow
would
come
soon
!
As
it
is
,
it
makes
one
depressed
to
go
into
the
garden
.
.
.
.
It
's
a
perfect
ruin
.
The
branches
creak
and
rattle
.
.
.
.
Yes
,
the
fine
days
are
over
!
''
``
They
are
over
,
''
repeated
Ivan
Ilyitch
.
Marya
Pavlovna
looked
out
of
the
vi^indow
in
silence
.
``
Please
God
,
they
will
come
back
,
''
observed
Ipatov
.
^
No
one
answered
him
.
``
Do
you
remember
the
delightful
singing
we
had
here
?
''
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
Yes
,
those
were
pleasant
times
!
''
``
But
you
might
sing
,
''
said
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
,
turning
to
Marya
Pavlovna
;
``
you
have
such
a
splendid
voice
.
''
She
did
not
answer
.
``
And
how
is
your
mother
?
''
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
to
Ipatov
,
not
knowing
how
to
keep
up
the
conversation
.
``
^
''
Thank
God
,
she
keeps
pretty
middling
in
spite
of
her
infirmities
.
To-day
she
went
out
in
her
chair
and
I
tell
you
she
is
like
an
old
broken
tree
it
creaks
and
creaks
;
and
yet
some
strong
young
sapling
will
fall
,
and
it
will
go
on
standing
.
Ech
,
ech
!
''
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Marya
Pavlovna
dropped
her
hands
on
her
knees
and
bowed
her
head
.
>
''
And
yet
she
has
a
bad
time
of
it
,
''
Ipatov
said
again
;
``
it
's
a
true
saying
that
old
age
is
no
happiness
.
''
``
Youth
is
n't
happiness
,
either
,
''
said
Marya
Pavlovna
as
though
to
herself
.
'
Vladimir
Sergeitch
wanted
to
go
home
that
evening
but
it
was
such
a
dark
night
that
he
did
not
venture
to
go
.
He
was
given
the
same
upstairs
room
in
which
three
months
before
he
had
spent
a
troubled
night
owing
to
Yegor
Kapitonitch
.
``
I
wonder
whether
he
still
snores
?
''
thought
Vladimir
Sergeitch
and
remembered
his
ad-
monitions
to
his
servant
;
he
recalled
Marya
Pavlovna
's
sudden
appearance
in
the
gar-
den
.
.
.
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
to
the
window
and
put
his
head
against
the
cold
pane
.
His
own
face
looked
in
at
him
dimly
from
without
;
his
eyes
seemed
up
against
a
curtain
of
darkness
and
only
after
a
little
time
could
he
distinguish
against
the
starless
sky
the
branches
of
trees
twisting
convulsively
in
the
black
night
.
They
were
being
lashed
by
the
relentless
wind
.
All
at
once
it
seemed
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
as
though
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
white
on
the
ground
.
...
He
looked
,
smiled
,
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
,
exclaiming
half
aloud
,
``
The
tricks
imagination
will
play
one
!
''
got
into
bed
.
He
fell
asleep
very
quickly
but
he
was
not
fated
to
spend
a
peaceful
night
on
this
occa-
sion
either
.
He
was
roused
by
a
hurrying
to
and
fro
in
the
house
.
He
lifted
up
his
head
from
the
pillow
.
.
.
.
He
heard
agitated
voices
,
exclamations
,
scurrying
footsteps
,
the
banging
of
doors
;
then
there
was
a
sound
of
women's
weeping
,
shouts
were
heard
in
the
garden
,
other
shouts
answered
them
in
the
distance
.
.
.
.
The
agitation
in
the
house
increased
,
and
grew
noisier
every
moment
.
.
.
.
``
There
must
be
a
fire
!
''
flashed
through
Vladimir
Sergeitch's
mind
.
In
alarm
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
the
window
,
but
there
was
no
glow
of
fire
;
only
red
points
of
light
were
moving
rap-
idly
along
the
garden
paths
between
the
trees
men
were
running
with
lanterns
.
Vladimir
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Sergeitch
went
quickly
to
the
door
,
opened
it
and
ran
straight
into
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
Pale
,
dis-
hevelled
and
half-dressed
,
the
latter
was
rush-
ing
along
without
knowing
where
he
was
going
.
``
What
is
it
?
What
has
happened
?
''
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
in
excitement
,
clutching
vig-
orously
at
his
arm
.
``
She
is
lost
,
she
is
drowned
,
she
has
thrown
herself
into
the
water
,
''
Ivan
Ilyitch
responded
in
a
breathless
voice
,
''
Who
is
in
the
water
,
who
is
lost
?
''
``
Marya
Pavlovna
!
Who
else
could
it
be
?
He
has
been
the
death
of
her
,
poor
darling
!
Help
!
Run
,
good
people
,
make
haste
!
Make
haste
,
lads
!
''
And
Ivan
Ilyitch
dashed
down
the
stairs
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
got
into
his
boots
,
flung
his
greatcoat
over
his
shoulders
and
ran
after
him
.
He
found
no
one
in
the
house
,
they
had
all
rushed
into
the
garden
;
only
the
little
girls
,
Ipatov
's
daughters
,
met
him
in
the
passage
close
to
the
front
door
;
half
dead
with
fright
they
were
standing
in
their
white
petticoats
with
clasped
hands
and
bare
feet
,
near
a
night-
light
on
the
ground
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
ran
through
the
drawing-room
,
passing
an
over-
turned
table
,
on
to
the
verandah
.
Through
the
shrubbery
,
in
the
direction
of
the
dam
,
lights
were
gleaming
and
shadows
were
fleeting
.
.
.
.
``
The
hooks
!
Run
for
the
hooks
!
''
he
heard
the
voice
of
Ipatov
.
``
The
net
,
the
net
!
The
boat
!
''
cried
other
voices
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
ran
towards
the
shouts
.
He
found
Ipatov
on
the
bank
of
the
pond
;
a
lantern
hung
on
a
branch
threw
a
vivid
light
on
the
old
man
's
grey
head
.
He
was
wringing
his
hands
and
staggering
as
though
he
were
drunk
;
on
the
grass
near
him
a
woman
was
writhing
and
sobbing
;
people
were
running
to
and
fro
.
Ivan
Ilyitch
was
already
up
to
his
knees
in
the
water
and
feeling
the
depth
with
a
pole
;
the
coachman
was
undressing
,
shivering
all
over
;
two
men
were
dragging
a
boat
along
the
bank
;
the
rapid
thud
of
horses
'
hoofs
could
be
heard
along
the
village
street
.
.
.
.
The
wind
blew
,
shrieking
,
as
though
doing
its
utmost
to
put
out
the
lanterns
.
The
waters
of
the
black
and
menacing
pond
splashed
noisily
on
the
bank
.
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
''
What
do
I
hear
!
''
cried
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
running
up
to
Ipatov
.
``
Is
it
possible
?
''
``
The
hooks
!
Quick
,
the
hooks
!
''
moaned
the
old
man
in
reply
.
``
But
perhaps
you
are
mistaken
,
Mihail
Niko-
laitch
!
''
``
No
,
how
can
it
be
a
mistake
!
''
the
woman
lying
on
the
grass
Marya
Pavlovna
's
maid
said
in
a
tearful
voice
,
``
wretch
that
I
am
,
I
heard
her
myself
jump
into
the
water
,
cry
out
,
'Save
me
,
'
and
then
once
mare
,
'Save
me
'
!
''
``
How
was
it
you
did
not
prevent
her
?
''
``
How
could
I
prevent
her
,
sir
?
Why
,
by
the
time
I
missed
her
she
was
gone
,
but
I
must
have
had
a
foreboding
in
my
heart
;
the
last
few
days
she
has
been
in
such
grief
and
did
not
say
a
word
;
but
I
knew
and
I
ran
straight
into
the
garden
,
as
though
someone
had
told
me
.
All
at
once
I
heard
something
go
plop
into
the
water
:
'Save
me
,
'
I
heard
her
cry
.
.
.
'save
me
!
'
.
.
.
Oh
,
dear
,
kind
people
!
''
``
But
perhaps
it
was
your
fancy
?
''
``
My
fancy
,
indeed
!
And
where
is
she
,
then
?
What
has
become
of
her
?
''
``
So
that
was
the
white
thing
I
thought
I
saw
in
the
darkness
,
''
thought
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
Meanwhile
men
had
run
up
with
hooks
,
brought
a
net
and
begun
laying
it
out
on
the
grass
,
numbers
of
people
came
up
,
there
was
a
great
running
to
and
fro
.
.
.
the
coachman
snatched
up
a
hook
,
the
village
elder
another
;
they
both
jumped
into
the
boat
,
pushed
off
and
began
dragging
the
water
with
the
hooks
;
they
were
lighted
from
the
bank
.
Their
movements
and
their
shadows
seemed
strange
and
terrible
in
the
darkness
,
on
the
troubled
water
in
the
dim
and
uncertain
light
of
the
lantern
.
``
It
's
caught
,
''
the
coachman
cried
suddenly
.
Everyone
stood
faint
with
expectation
.
``
A
stump
,
''
said
the
coachman
,
and
pulled
out
the
hook
.
``
Come
back
,
come
back
,
''
they
shouted
from
the
bank
,
``
you
will
do
nothing
with
the
hooks
,
you
want
the
net
.
''
``
Yes
,
yes
,
the
net
,
''
others
chimed
in
.
``
Stay
,
''
cried
the
village
elder
,
``
my
hook
has
caught
too
.
...
I
think
it
's
something
soft
,
''
he
added
a
little
later
.
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
A
patch
of
white
came
into
sight
near
the
boat
.
``
The
young
lady
!
''
cried
the
village
elder
''
It
's
she
!
''
He
was
right
.
.
,
the
hook
had
caught
Marya
Pavlovna
by
the
sleeve
of
her
dress
.
The
coachman
got
hold
of
her
at
once
,
they
drew
her
out
of
the
water
.
.
.
with
two
strong
strokes
the
boat
was
brought
to
the
bank
.
.
.
.
Ipatov
,
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
all
rushed
to
Marya
Pavlovna
,
lifted
her
up
and
carried
her
home
in
their
arms
.
They
undressed
her
,
warmed
her
and
tried
to
restore
respiration
.
.
.
.
But
all
their
efforts
were
in
vain
.
Marya
Pavlovna
did
not
come
to
her-
self
.
,
.
,
Life
had
fled
.
Next
morning
early
Vladimir
Sergeitch
left
Ipatovka
;
before
he
set
off
he
went
to
take
the
last
farewell
of
the
dead
girl
.
She
was
lying
on
the
table
in
the
drawing-room
in
a
white
dress
.
Her
thick
hair
was
hardly
dry
,
there
was
a
look
of
sorrowful
bewilderment
on
her
pale
face
which
was
still
unchanged
;
her
parted
lips
seemed
striving
to
speak
and
ask
some
question
.
.
.
her
crossed
arms
seemed
pressing
on
her
bosom
as
though
in
anguish
.
.
.
.
But
with
whatever
bitter
thoughts
the
poor
girl
had
^7
perished
,
death
had
laid
upon
her
its
imprint
of
eternal
silence
and
resignation
.
.
,
.
And
who
can
say
what
the
dead
face
expresses
in
those
few
moments
when
for
the
last
time
it
meets
the
eyes
of
the
living
before
vanishing
forever
and
perishing
in
the
grave
?
Vladimir
Sergeitch
stood
in
decorous
melan-
choly
before
the
body
of
Marya
Pavlovna
,
crossed
himself
three
times
and
went
out
with-
out
noticing
Ivan
Ilyitch
,
who
was
quietly
weep-
ing
in
the
corner
,
.
.
.
And
he
was
not
the
only
one
who
wept
that
day
,
all
the
servants
in
the
house
wept
bitterly
:
nothing
but
good
was
remembered
of
Marya
Pavlovna
.
A
week
later
old
Ipatov
wrote
as
follows
in
reply
to
a
letter
that
had
come
at
last
from
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
:
''
A
week
ago
,
dear
Madam
Nadyezhda
Alex-
yevna
,
my
sister-in-law
,
your
friend
Marya
Pavlovna
,
made
an
end
of
her
life
by
throwing
herself
at
night
into
the
pond
and
we
have
al-
ready
consigned
her
body
to
the
earth
.
She
took
this
grievous
and
terrible
step
without
saying
good-bye
to
me
,
without
leaving
a
letter
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
or
the
smallest
note
to
convey
her
last
wishes
.
.
.
.
But
you
know
better
than
anyone
,
Nad-
yezhda
Alexyevna
,
on
whose
soul
this
great
and
mortal
sin
should
fall
!
May
the
Lord
be
your
brother
's
judge
,
but
my
sister-in-law
could
neither
forget
him
nor
survive
the
separation
.
''
By
the
time
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
received
this
letter
she
was
in
Italy
,
where
she
had
gone
with
her
husband
,
Count
de
Steltchinsky
,
as
he
was
styled
in
all
the
hotels
.
It
was
not
only
the
hotels
he
visited
,
however
:
he
was
fre-
quently
seen
in
gambling
saloons
,
in
the
Kur-
saals
in
watering
places
.
...
At
first
he
lost
a
great
deal
of
money
,
then
left
oflF
losing
,
and
his
face
assumed
the
peculiar
expression
,
half
suspicious
,
half
impudent
,
which
is
seen
in
a
man
liable
to
being
suddenly
involved
in
some
unpleasant
affray
.
.
.
.
He
rarely
saw
his
wife
.
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
was
not
dull
in
his
ab-
sence
,
however
.
She
developed
a
taste
for
the
arts
.
Her
acquaintances
chiefly
consisted
of
artists
and
she
liked
discussing
the
beautiful
with
young
men
.
Ipatov
's
letter
grieved
her
extremely
but
did
not
prevent
her
from
going
XA
the
same
day
to
the
``
Cave
of
Dogs
''
to
watch
unfortunate
animals
gasp
for
breath
as
they
were
plunged
into
sulphurous
fumes
.
She
did
not
go
alone
.
She
was
accompanied
by
several
admirers
.
Among
them
the
most
amiable
was
considered
to
be
Mr.
Popelin
,
an
unsuccessful
French
painter
with
a
beard
and
a
check
jacket
.
He
sang
the
newest
songs
in
a
thin
tenor
,
made
jokes
in
a
very
free-and-
easy
style
and
ate
a
very
great
deal
though
he
was
very
lean
.
CHAPTER
VII
It
was
a
sunny
,
frosty
day
in
January
;
num-
bers
of
people
were
walking
along
the
Nevsky
.
The
clock
on
the
tower
of
the
Town
Hall
struck
three
.
Our
old
acquaintance
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Astahov
was
walking
among
others
on
the
broad
flags
sprinkled
with
yellow
sand
.
He
had
grown
much
more
manly
looking
since
we
parted
from
him
;
he
had
grown
whiskers
and
was
stouter
all
over
but
did
not
look
older
.
He
followed
the
crowd
without
haste
,
from
time
to
time
looking
about
him
:
he
was
ex-
pecting
his
wife
;
she
had
meant
to
drive
up
in
their
carriage
with
her
mother
.
It
was
about
five
years
since
Vladimir
Sergeitch
had
mar-
ried
,
exactly
as
he
wished
;
his
wife
was
wealthy
and
with
the
best
connections
.
Aflfably
lifting
his
superbly
brushed
hat
as
he
met
his
numer-
ous
acquaintances
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
moved
forward
with
the
free
step
of
a
man
satisfied
with
his
lot
.
All
at
once
,
close
to
the
Arcade
,
he
was
almost
run
into
by
a
man
in
a
Spanish
cloak
and
a
jockey
cap
;
his
face
was
rather
the
worse
for
wear
,
his
moustache
was
dyed
and
his
big
eyes
looked
out
from
swollen
and
puffy
eyelids
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
moved
aside
with
dignity
,
but
the
gentleman
in
the
cap
stared
at
him
and
suddenly
exclaimed
:
'^
``
Ah
!
Mr.
Astahov
,
how
are
you
?
''
-
Vladimir
Sergeitch
made
no
reply
and
stood
still
in
amazement
.
He
could
not
imagine
how
a
gentleman
who
had
the
temerity
to
appear
on
the
Nevsky
in
a
jockey
cap
knew
his
surname
.
``
You
do
n't
recognise
me
,
''
the
gentleman
in
the
cap
went
on
;
``
I
saw
you
eight
years
ago
in
the
country
,
in
T.
province
,
at
the
Ipatovs
.
My
name
is
Veretyev
.
''
``
Oh
,
dear
!
I
beg
your
pardon
!
''
exclaimed
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
``
but
how
you
have
changed
.
''
``
Yes
,
I
am
older
,
''
answered
Pyotr
Alexe-
itch
,
and
he
passed
over
his
face
a
hand
with-
out
a
glove
,
``
but
you
,
now
,
have
not
changed
.
''
Veretyev
did
not
so
much
look
older
as
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
fallen
off
and
deteriorated
.
Tiny
,
delicate
wrinkles
covered
his
whole
face
and
when
he
talked
his
lips
and
cheeks
twitched
slightly
.
Everything
about
him
indicated
that
he
had
been
living
hard
.
y
''
Where
have
you
been
lost
all
this
time
that
one
has
seen
nothing
of
you
?
''
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
I
have
been
wandering
about
.
And
have
you
been
in
Petersburg
all
the
time
?
''
``
For
the
most
part
in
Petersburg
.
''
``
Are
you
married
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
And
Vladimir
Sergeitch
assumed
a
rather
severe
air
as
though
to
say
to
Veretyev
,
``
Don't
venture
to
ask
me
,
my
good
fellow
,
to
introduce
you
to
my
wife
.
''
Veretyev
seemed
to
understand
him
.
A
care-
less
smile
faintly
stirred
his
lips
.
``
And
how
is
your
sister
?
''
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
.
``
Where
is
she
?
''
``
I
ra
n't
tell
you
for
certain
.
I
expect
she
is
in
Moscow
.
I
have
not
had
a
letter
from
her
for
a
long
time
.
''
``
And
is
her
husband
living
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
And
Mr.
Ipatov
himself
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
;
I
expect
he
is
alive
too
;
but
he
may
be
dead
.
''
``
And
that
other
gentleman
what
was
his
name
?
Bodryakov
,
was
n't
it
?
''
``
The
one
you
asked
to
be
your
second
,
do
you
remember
,
when
you
were
in
such
a
funk
?
The
devil
only
knows
.
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
with
a
dignified
face
re-
mained
silent
.
``
I
always
recall
with
pleasure
those
eve-
nings
,
''
he
continued
,
``
when
I
had
the
oppor-
tunity
(
he
had
almost
said
'honour
'
)
of
mak-
ing
the
acquaintance
of
your
sister
and
your-
self
.
She
is
a
very
charming
person
.
Do
you
still
sing
as
agreeably
?
''
``
No
,
I
've
lost
my
voice
.
.
.
.
Yes
,
that
was
a
nice
time
.
''
``
I
visited
Ipatovka
once
since
,
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
on
,
raising
his
eyebrows
mourn-
fully
;
``
I
think
that
was
what
they
called
the
village
on
the
very
day
of
a
terrible
event
.
.
.
.
''
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
''
Yes
,
yes
,
that
was
horrible
,
horrible
,
''
Veret-
yev
hurriedly
interrupted
him
.
``
Yes
,
yes
and
do
you
remember
how
you
almost
fought
a
duel
with
my
present
brother-in-law
?
''
``
H
'm
!
Yes
,
I
remember
,
''
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
replied
deliberately
.
``
However
,
I
must
confess
,
it
is
so
long
ago
that
it
all
seems
to
me
rather
like
a
dream
now
.
''
``
Like
a
dream
,
''
Veretyev
repeated
,
and
his
pale
cheeks
flushed
``
like
a
dream
...
no
,
it
was
not
a
dream
,
not
for
me
,
anyway
.
It
was
the
time
of
youth
,
of
gaiety
,
of
happiness
,
the
time
of
boundless
hopes
and
unconquerable
strength
,
and
if
it
was
a
dream
,
it
was
a
lovely
dream
.
But
that
we
have
grown
old
and
stupid
,
and
dye
our
moustache
,
and
lounge
about
the
Nevsky
and
are
good
for
nothing
like
broken-down
hacks
,
that
we
have
lost
our
savour
,
have
worn
threadbare
,
whether
we
are
stuck
up
and
dignified
or
whether
we
are
simply
loafers
,
and
,
very
likely
,
drown
our
sorrow
in
wine
that
is
more
like
a
dream
,
and
a
most
hideous
dream
.
Our
life
has
been
lived
and
lived
in
vain
,
absurdly
,
vulgarly
that
's
what
is
bitter
!
If
only
one
could
sliake
that
off
like
a
dream
,
if
only
one
could
wake
up
from
that
.
.
.
.
And
then
everywhere
,
always
one
awful
memory
,
one
phantom
.
.
.
.
But
good-bye
.
''
Veretyev
moved
rapidly
away
,
but
on
reach-
ing
the
doors
of
one
of
the
principal
cafes
of
the
Nevsky
Prospect
,
stopped
,
went
in
and
tossing
off
at
the
bar
a
glass
of
orange
bitters
,
he
crossed
the
billiard-room
,
dark
and
foggy
with
tobacco
fumes
,
and
went
into
a
back
room
.
There
he
found
some
friends
,
old
comrades
:
Petya
Lasurin
,
Kostya
Kovrovsky
,
Prince
Ser-
dyukov
and
two
gentlemen
who
were
addressed
simply
as
Vasyuk
and
Filat
.
They
were
all
men
no
longer
young
,
though
unmarried
;
some
were
a
little
bald
,
others
were
turning
grey
,
they
had
wrinkled
faces
and
double
chins
;
in
short
,
these
gentlemen
had
all
,
as
they
say
,
be-
gun
going
to
seed
.
They
all
,
however
,
still
looked
upon
Veretyev
as
an
exceptional
man
,
destined
to
astonish
the
world
,
and
he
was
more
intelligent
only
in
that
he
was
very
well
aware
of
his
complete
and
essential
uselessness
.
And
even
outside
his
own
circle
there
were
people
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
who
thought
of
him
that
if
he
had
not
ruined
himself
,
something
very
remarkable
might
have
come
of
him
.
.
.
.
These
people
were
mistaken
:
nothing
ever
does
come
of
the
Veretyevs
.
y
Pyotr
Alexeitch
's
friends
met
him
with
their
usual
greetings
.
He
puzzled
them
at
first
by
his
gloomy
expression
and
bitter
remarks
,
but
he
soon
recovered
,
grew
merry
and
things
went
as
usual
.
As
soon
as
Veretyev
left
him
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
frowned
and
drew
himself
up
.
Pyotr
Alexeitch
's
sudden
outburst
had
greatly
per-
plexed
and
even
offended
him
.
``
Grown
stupid
,
drink
,
dye
our
moustache
.
.
.
paries
pour
vous
,
mon
cher
,
''
he
said
at
last
almost
aloud
and
snorting
once
or
twice
with
involuntary
indignation
,
was
about
to
con-
tinue
his
walk
.
``
Who
was
that
talking
to
you
?
''
he
heard
a
loud
and
self-confident
voice
behind
him
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
turned
round
and
saw
one
of
his
intimate
friends
,
a
certain
Mr.
Pom-
ponsky
.
This
Mr.
Pomponsky
,
a
tall
and
stout
gentleman
,
held
a
rather
important
post
and
Z^7
.
had
never
once
,
even
in
his
early
youth
,
had
the
slightest
doubt
of
his
own
efficiency
.
``
Oh
,
a
queer
fellow
,
''
said
Vladimir
Serge-
itch
,
taking
Pomponsky
's
arm
.
``
Upon
my
soul
,
Vladimir
Sergeitch
,
is
it
pos-
sible
for
a
gentleman
to
be
seen
talking
in
the
street
to
an
individual
in
a
jockey
cap
?
It's
unseemly
!
I
am
amazed
!
Where
could
you
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
person
?
''
``
In
the
country
.
''
``
In

ce

.
A
gentleman
must
always
behave
like
a
gentleman
if
he
wants
.
.
.
''
``
Here
is
my
wife
,
''
Vladimir
Sergeitch
made
haste
to
interrupt
him
.
``
Let
us
go
to
her
.
''
And
the
two
gentlemen
made
their
way
to
a
smart
,
low
carriage
,
from
the
window
of
which
the
pale
,
fatigued
and
irritably
haughty
face
of
a
woman
still
young
,
but
already
a
little
faded
,
was
looking
out
:
Another
lady
who
also
seemed
cross
,
her
mother
,
could
be
seen
behind
her
.
Vladimir
Sergeitch
opened
the
carriage
door
and
gave
his
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
wife
his
arm
.
Pomponsky
approached
the
mother-in-law
and
both
couples
walked
along
the
Nevsky
accompanied
by
a
short
,
black-
haired
footman
in
greenish
gaiters
with
a
big
cockade
on
his
hat
.
