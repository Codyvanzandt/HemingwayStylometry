The
avowals
of
a
Steeplejack
Why
shouldn
t
a
steeplejack
make
avowals
It
is
a
dangerous
occupa
tion
and
oddly
enough
one
in
which
the
higher
you
mount
the
lower
you
fall
socially
Yet
a
steeplejack
humble
as
is
his
calling
may
be
a
dreamer
of
daring
dreams
a
poet
even
a
hero
I
who
write
these
words
am
no
poet
but
I
have
been
a
steeplejack
I
have
climbed
to
the
very
top
of
many
steeples
the
world
over
and
dreamed
like
the
rest
of
my
fellow
beings
the
dreams
that
accompany
the
promenade
of
pure
blood
through
young
arteries
and
now
after
a
half
century
I
shall
re
port
these
dreams
and
their
awakenings
for
the
differ
ence
between
the
dream-world
and
what
we
are
pleased
to
call
reality
is
something
which
no
poet
philosopher
or
psychologist
has
yet
explained
Whether
we
dream
at
night
when
our
body
vegetates
or
our
dreams
overflow
into
our
waking
hours
does
not
much
matter
To
dream
is
to
exist
I
dream
therefore
I
am
might
be
the
form
ula
of
a
second
Descartes
And
who
enjoys
loftier
dreams
than
a
steeplejack
But
alas
he
must
always
return
to
earth
else
perish
aloft
from
the
cold
When
a
boy
I
was
called
a
Johnny-Iook-in-the-air
be
cause
of
my
reckless
habit
of
rambling
into
obstacles
from
moving
locomotives
to
immovable
lamp-posts
I
suppose
I
was
dreaming
at
least
I
was
walking
in
that
pleasing
haze
we
call
egotism
Now
a
large
dosage
of
self-love
is
a
necessary
ingredient
in
the
formation
of
character
character
called
by
the
Greeks
a
man
s
des
tiny
that
character
which
leads
to
success
only
when
followed
no
matter
the
cost
Chamfort
said
this
but

to
whose
care
our
tenderest
and
most
susceptible
years
are
usually
confided
cry
anathema
Cynical
they
say
Well
what
if
it
be
A
cynic
like
a
pessimist
is
only
a
man
who
tells
unpleasant
truths
while
your
optimist
spins
pleasing
lies
therefore
is
the
more
popular
of
the
pair
Nothing
succeeds
like
insincerity
A
steeplejack
never
lies
His
truth
is
the
truth
At
least
I
thought
so
years
before
I
encountered
this
aphor
ism
in
the
book
of
Max
Stirner
an
anarch
I
tried
to
climb
always
in
the
azure
but
my
muscles
were
unde
veloped
and
wings
I
had
none
to
speak
of
the
conse
quences
may
be
well
imagined
Many
a
tumble
broken
bones
and
what
sentimentalists
would
describe
as
shat
tered
illusions
Really
no
illusions
were
dissipated
Fifty
years
have
passed
and
I
am
still
the
incorrigible
dreamer
with
one
eye
on
earthly
banquets
and
a
steeple
jack
So
endure
my
childish
egotism
doubled
by
the
garrulity
of
an
elderly
person
who
ever
carries
his
um
brella
abroad
even
when
the
sun
bathes
in
the
blue
bowl
of
the
firmament
An
egotistical
steeplejack
then
but
not
a
spinner
of
yarns
that
is
I
hope
not
incredible
yarns
though
lying
is
like
a
forest
the
deeper
in
you
go
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
escape
The
narration
on
whose
road
I
am
starting
out
so
gaily
may
puzzle
but
it
need
not
alarm
you
It
is
the
story
of
an
unquiet
soul
who
voyaged
from
city
to
city
country
to
country
in
search
of
some
thing
he
knew
not
what
The
golden
grapes
of
desire
were
never
plucked
the
marvellous
mirage
of
the
Seven
Arts
never
overtaken
the

and

Life
has
been
the
Barmecide
s
feast
to
me
you
remember
the
Arabian
Nights
no
sooner
did
I
covet
a
rare
dish
than
fate
whisked
it
out
of
my
reach
I
love
painting
and
sculpture
I
may
only
look
but
never
own
either
pictures
or
marbles
I
would
fain
be
a
pianist
a
composer
of
music
I
am
neither
Nor
a
poet
Nor
a
novelist
actor
playwright
I
have
written
of
many
things
from
architecture
to
zoology
without
grasping
their
inner
substance
I
am

A

An
egotist
who
is
not
ashamed
to
avow
it
Everyone
for
himself
in
this
desert
of
egotism
called
life
cried
Stendhal
George
Moore
has
said
that
self-esteem
is
synono
mous
to
genius
a
delightful
concept
which
suddenly
peoples
our
ark
of
mediocrity
with
wild
genius
The
Russian
proverb
sounds
a
deeper
note
Egotism
is
the
salt
of
life
Of
pride
we
can
not
have
too
much
wrote
poor
Nietzsche
who
has
been
unjustly
abused
for
iis
pride
he
the
humblest
among
men
This
dictum
of
his
was
but
a
counsel
of
self-perfection
Zola
called
attention
to
the
egotism
of
the
English
because
as
he
naively
re
marked
their
personal
pronoun
is
capitalised
while
the
French
write
je
unless
beginning
a
sentence
This
is
a
slap
at
what
Pascal
described
as
the
hateful
I
I
best
like
old
Walt
Whitman
s
declaration
of
personal
independence
I
find
no
sweeter
fat
than
sticks
to
my
own
bones
Let
us
admit
strictly
between
our
selves
that
we
are
all
egotists
as
we
are
all
snobs
ac
cording
to
Thackeray
Some
won
t
acknowledge
this
But
it
is
true
A
world
without
egotism
would
cease
to
exist
every
grain
of
sand
is
self-centred
every
monad
has
its
day
Therefore
bear
with
me
if
I
talk
of
my
petty
personal
affairs
bear
with
my
thunder
and
small
beer
especially
the
chronicling
thereof
A
critic
should
confess
his
limitations
draw
up
at
the
beginning
of
a
book
a
formal
scenario
of
his
temperament
prejudices
his
likes
and
dislikes
A
French
critic
Hennequin
did
this
and
has
since
served
as
an
exemplar
for
the
English
writer
John
M
Robertson
Then
your
readers
would
know
what
to
expect
would
discount
radical
utterances
on
hearing
that
your
grandfather
had
been
a
Fenian
or
that
your
aunt
was
opposed
to
female
suffrage
This
is
no
Apologia
but
an
illuminating
diagram
He
who
runs
may
see
may
read
To
be
quite
frank
I
had
rather
echo
the
piteous
prayer
of
Charles
Baudelaire
Oh
Lord
God
Give
me
the
force
and
courage
to
contem
plate
my
heart
and
body
without
disgust
To
which
we
should
all
of
us
heartily
reply
Amen
Taking
it
for
granted
that
I
am
an
egotist
a

sional
egotist
for

to
make
my

he
who
lives
by
the
pen
shall
perish
by
the
pen
that
I
am
a
newspaper
man
not
a
journalist
of
whom
the
late
Joseph
Howard

said
Newspaper

why
shouldn

my

relate
my

among
medi
ocrities
Benvenuto
Cellini
said
that
the
writing
of
his
autobiography
was
the
duty
of
every
eminent
man
and
also
those
not
eminent
slyly
adds
Leslie
Stephen
who
was
probably
thinking
of
Pepys
It
is
my
belief
that
every
man
on
the
threshold
of
life
should
write
both
his
memoirs
and
his
obituary
so
as
to
match
them
with
the
assembled
mature
patterns
of
his
career
All
is
relative
even
our
poor
relatives
as
metaphysicians
have
observed
so
it
doesn
t
matter
what
you
gossip
about
whether
it
be
the
stars
or
clam-chowder
The
APOLOGY
important
matter
lies
in
the
manner
of

The

This
is
a
medley
of
Buf
fon
and
Shakespeare
In
his
charming
essay
on
Auto
biography
Leslie
Stephen
declared
that
Nobody
ever
wrote
a
dull
autobiography
and
continuing
said
that
it
is
always
curious
to
see
how
a
man
contrives
to
pre
sent
a
false
testimonial
to
himself
It
is
pleasant
to
be
admitted
behind
the
scenes
and
trace
the
growth
of
that
singular
phantom
which
like
the
Spectre
of
the
Brocken
is
the
man
s
own
shadow
cast
upon
the
coloured
and
distorting
mists
of
memory
Instead
of
ponderous
philosophies
what
wouldn
t
we
give
for
more
personalia
from
the
ancient
world
another
Petronius
another
Sue
tonius
those
wicked
old
gossips
Dame
Quickly
or
Jus
tice
Shallow
are
as
vital
and
important
as
Hamlet
or
Lear
Mediocrity
too
is
the
salt
of
existence
Didn
t
Mirabeau
cry
Mon
Dieu
donnez-moi
la
mediocrite
No
man
or
woman
likes
to
be
classed
among
medi
ocrities
I
wonder
why
We
are
middle-class
there
is
no
lower
or
upper
class
in
our
country
that
William
Jennings
Bryan
decided
several
years
ago
our
ancestors
were
for
the
most
part
proletarian
when
they
were
not
criminals
dumped
over
here
by
England
in
the
early
eighteenth
century
labourers
runaways
patriots
the
poor
the
dissatisfied
and
recently
the
very
dregs
of
southeastern
Europe
of
whom
should
we
be
particularly
proud
We
should
not
assume
either
the
airs
of
fash
ionable
folk
or
of
supermen
We
are
neither
though
the
Eternal
Snob
is
always
with
us
like
the
politician
Max
Beerbohm
summed
up
the
future
of
socialism
in
a
memorable
epigram
If
he
would
have
his
ideas
realised
the
socialist
must
first
kill
the
snob
Why
shouldn
t
we
enjoy
hearing
ourselves
called
medi
ocre
It
is
our
ingrained
Bovarysme
the
attempt
to
seem
otherwise
than
we
are
Thackeray
when
he
wrote
his
Book
of
Snobs
was
not
aware
of
the
underlying
phi
losophy
in
his
subject
Since
his
day
a
young
French
philosopher
Jules
Gaultier
has
set
forth
with
abundant
testimony
his
doctrine
that
all
life
aspires
to
appear
other
than
it
is
the
Eternal
Camouflage
the
Everlasting
Mas
querade
The
snob
is
only
a
tiny
manifestation
of
the
cosmical
lie
that
permeates
all
sentient
beings
It
is
in
brief
an
Evolution
developed
under
the
aspect
of
eternity
this
clear
thinking
of
Young
France
outweighs
the
sub
tle
but
sterile
and
scholastic
philosophy
of
Henri
Berg
son
I
have
often
wondered
why
armed
with
such
a
viable
theory
as
this
of
M
Gaultier
some
essayist
has
not
made
a
plea
for
mediocrity
Supermen
superrogues
sentimental
humbugs
are
done
to
the
death
yet
not
a
word
of
praise
is
given
the
garden
variety
of
the
human
plant
Like
the
average
sensual
man
and
the
man
in
the
street
he
is
taken
for
granted
Mediocrity
is
the
backbone
of
our
country
The
man
in
the
street
whose
collective
opinion
whose
vote
rules
whose
fight
ing
spirit
protects
us
isn
t
this
chap
this
fellowe
and
his
wife
worth
studying
A
majority
of
exalted
souls
would
transform
America
into
a
howling
wilder
ness
The
word
mediocrity
has
become
debased
in
meaning
It
formerly
stood
for
the
happy
equilibrium
of
our
mental
and
physical
forces
The
golden
medi
ocrity
of
the
Latin
poet
To
its
possessor
it
spelled
con
tent
and
as
long
as
the
wolf
was
kept
from
the
door
contentment
reigned
That
is
the
precise
word
con
tentment
not
happiness
which
is
too
ecstatic
to
last
without
burning
up
nerve-tissue
or
without
insanity
supervening
To
be
contented
was
once
a
gift
of
the
APOLOGY
gods
nowadays
it
means
that
you
are
commonplace
without
social
ambitions
And
this
is
not
well
Notwithstanding
that
we
are
a
nation
of
one
hundred
million
humans
mostly
busybodies
and
politicians
as
Carlyle
would
say
we
are
each
in
his
own
fashion
en
deavouring
to
escape
the
imputation
of
mediocrity
In
vain
Number
is
mediocrity
We
think
to
order
vote
as
we
are
bidden
and
wear
the
clothes
we
are
ordered
to
wear
by
destroyers
of
taste
Why
then
this
mad
de
sire
to
be
exceptional
whence
this
cowardice
that
shud
ders
before
genuine
art
and
espouses
the
mediocre
be
cause
it
is
more
soothing
to
fat
nerves
Let
us
hear
the
truth
It
is
because
happily
for
us
mediocrity
is
the
normal
condition
of
mankind
and
genius
is
not
We
pretend
that
we
are
not
mediocre
Ah
Bovarysme
in
escapable
yet
we
proudly
point
to
our
national
pros
perity
Says
Emerson
Is
it
not
the
chief
disgrace
in
the
world
not
to
be
a
unit
to
be
reckoned
one
character
not
to
yield
that
peculiar
fruit
which
each
man
was
created
to
bear
but
to
be
reckoned
by
the
gross
in
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
the
party
of
the
section
to
which
we
belong
and
our
opinion
predicted
geographi
cally
or
the
north
or
the
south
I
confess
however
I
like
to
saunter
from
my
own
bailiwick
and
watch
my
neighbour
Anything
human
or
inhuman
interests
Not
that
I
am
a
Paul
Pry
but
because
curiosity
assuaged
is
a
prime
condiment
in
the
cuisine
of
life
We
are
all
hypo
crites
whether
we
call
ourselves
idealists
or
pragmatists
There
is
no
such
thing
as
altruism
only
certain
souls
who
self-illuded
believe
themselves
to
be
disinterested
Be
frank
Be
egotists
like
myself
and
the
rest
of
men
and
women
and
children
the
supreme
egotists
Con
fess
in
your
narrow
timorous
souls
that
there

nothing

STEEPLEJACK

You

in

Yourself
The

The

I

In

of
my

I
am
not

to
consider
your

or
compelled
to
apply
a
poultice
to

If

A

I
promise
to

everything
even

which
Edgar

PART
I
IN
OLD
PHILADELPHIA
I
AM
BORN
Let
us
begin
at
the
beginning
I
am
the
second
son
of
my
parents
and
was
born
under
the
sign
of
Aquarius
symbol
of
inconstancy
literally
before
my
time
for
I
am
a
seventh
months
child
not
however
born
with
a
caul
like
David
Copperfield
yet
an
object
of
curiosity
to
the
neighbours
and
a
cause
of
extreme
solicitude
to
my
parents
I
was
told
by
my
old
nurse
a
devoted
Irish
servant
with
us
over
a
quarter
of
a
century
where
are
such
servants
to
be
found
in
1919
that
I
reposed
in
a
little
box
heavily
wadded
with
wool
and
on
the
mantelpiece
which
in
the
houses
of
those
days
was
broad
and
commodious
A
queer
way
to
begin
life
the
top
of
a
hearth
No
doubt
I
would
have
figured
in
an
incubator
if
there
had
been
such
an
institution
The
fact
of
my
premature
birth
is
not
of
national
im
portance
but
it
is
a
fact
that
has
solved
several
puzzling
questions
for
me
The
health
of
my
mother
had
been
delicate
for
a
year
and
the
death
of
an
infant
sister
brought
much
sorrow
into
her
life
Naturally
such
mental
and
physical
conditions
reacted
unfavourably
on
my
organism
I
was
what
boys
contemptuously
call
a
cry-baby
That
unfortunate
cotton-wool
pursued
me
for
years
I
was
not
only
a
cry-baby
but
a
child
that
always
kept
close
to
its
mother
s
skirts
I
had
still
have
the
mother-cult
In
early
childhood
it
was
an
obsession
Mother
s
boys
seldom
fight
back
and
I
was
no
exception
I
am
not
an
unqualified
believer
in
heredity
because
of
the
disconcerting
slap
in
the
face
so
often
given
the
investigator
by
data
Weismann
has
asserted
that
acquired
traits
are
not
transmitted
This
must
be
true
as
neither
my
father
nor
mother
were
tearful
persons
if
they
were
sentimental
it
was
normal
and
it
belonged
to
their
period
sometimes
called
the
Mid-Victorian
Let
us
call
it
Before
the
War
that
liberating
war
of
1861
which
well-nigh
disrupted
the
Union
My
morbid
sensibility
may
be
set
down
to
my
unexpected
appearance
in
the
vale
of
sorrows
and
I
long
suffered
from
shyness
absurd
sentimentality
and
a
hor
ror
of
the
actual
Need
I
add
that
I
have
bravely
out
lived
this
youthful
bashfulness
In
everyone
s
memory
there
is
at
least
one
glittering
peak
around
which
cluster
or
swirl
the
mists
of
minor
happenings
peculiar
to
childhood
Naturally
I
can
t
recall
the
outbreak
of
the
war
but
I
remember
as
sharply
as
if
it
were
yesterday
a
walk
down
Chestnut
Street
clinging
to
my
mother
s
hand
scared
but
curious
The
entire
world
was
out
in
holiday
mood
Independence
Hall
was
decorated
with
flags
People
were
cheering
Bands
playing
The
most
vivid
recollection
the
high
light
of
the
moment
was
the
deafening
sound
of
bells
There
were
the
bells
on
the
old-fashioned
hose-carts
and
they
were
rung
by
red-shirted
firemen
Confused
by
the
clangour
the
crowds
I
asked
my
mother
what
it
all
meant
She
answered
Richmond
has
fallen
I
didn
t
understand
What
could
Richmond
mean
to
a
boy
still
in
skirts
Although
I
was
reading
Dickens
at
the
age
of
seven
it
was
years
before
I
appreciated
the
significance
of
that
phrase
the
first
one
that
I
can
recall
from
my
mother
s
lips
Richmond
has
fallen
The
next
high-light
was
the
excitement
over
the
assas
sination
of
President
Lincoln
Philadelphia
no
matter
her
Tory
leanings
during
the
war
of
the
Revolution
is
an
intensely
patriotic
city
and
that
patriotism
reached
my
infantile
sensorium
despite
the
fact
I
had
no
com
prehension
of
the
tragic
event
The
way
it
was
fixed
in
my
brain-cells
came
about
in
this
fashion
An
image
is
more
lasting
than
an
idea
and
the
image
was
the
result
of
a
picture
a
living
one
framed
by
either
side
of
lower
Chestnut
Street
Night-time
Torches
illuminated
a
vast
and
solemn
procession
which
moved
at
a
funereal
pace
It
had
seemed
to
me
years
before
this
mournful
column
passed
the
printing-office
of
my
grandfather
Gibbons
at
No
333
Chestnut
From
my
mother
s
arms
I
was
permitted
to
peep
from
time
to
time
through
a
window
on
the
third
floor
The
windows
were
crowded
Our
family
must
have
been
there
I
fell
asleep
I
was
awakened
by
the
words
Here
comes
General
Han
cock
Another
mystery
Dazzled
by
the
moving
lights
I
made
out
a
huge
dark
object
but
didn
t
understand
its
meaning
Nevertheless
I
was
unconsciously
assisting
at
the
obsequies
of
the
greatest
man
since
George
Wash
ington
to
whom
the
United
States
has
given
birth
Abraham
Lincoln
His
remains
lay
in
state
at
Inde
pendence
Hall
April
22
1865
of
that
I
remember
nothing
But
the
flare
of
the
torches
the
moving
catafalque
and
the
rumours
of
a
people
in
mourning
I
shall
never
forget
The
third
high-light
found
me
older
and
for
my
age
an
omnivorous
reader
Anything
from
Shakespeare
to
the
weather
reports
in
the
Daily
Ledger
were
welcome
Stendhal
Henry
Beyle
boasted
that
his
brain
de
manded
a
thousand
cubic
feet
of
ideas
daily
to
stoke
up
the
cerebral
system
a
steamboat
brain
but
I
needed
more
if
not
ideas
then
words
The
rather
uncertain
science
of
meteorology
in
its
infancy
enthralled
my
imagination
The
clouds
were
my
constant
preoccupa
tion
A
pillar
of
fire
by
night
the
stars
and
moon
the
clouds
in
daylight
J
aime
les

I
could
have
cried
with
my
adored
poet
Baudelaire
But
the
sad
bad
mad
and
unhappy
Frenchman
didn
t
bother
me
in
1870
I
was
too
busy
on
the
roof
of
our
house
at
1434
North
Seventh
Street
it
still
stands
this
house
between
Master
and
Jefferson
although
the
trolley-car
conductors
have
not
begun
to
point
it
out
as
my
birthplace
watching
for
storms
Well
one
came
and
for
years
I
didn
t
wish
to
see
an
other
It
was
on
a
certain
Sunday
afternoon
in
May
warm
sultry
threatening
stormy
From
my
observa
tory
a
barrel
in
the
garret
my
head
popping
out
of
an
aperture
in
the
roof
I
noted
with
joy
and
fear
a
tre
mendous
disturbance
in
the
western
sky
beyond
the
Schuylkill
River
Two
clouds
of
greenish-yellow
hue
rushed
towards
each
other
interlocked
and
after
a
brief
struggle
melted
into
one
ominous
funnel-shaped
appari
tion
The
classic
tornado
shape
though
evidently
on
a
miniature
scale
if
contrasted
with
a
Kansas
twister
But
size
wasn
t
the
quality
that
scared
me
it
was
the
terrific
speed
and
scream
of
the
approaching
monster
I
hurriedly
closed
the
trapdoor
and
almost
fell
down
stairs
yelling
Whirlwind
whirlwind
Midnight
blackness
had
settled
upon
the
city
by
the
time
our
win
dows
were
tightly
closed
The
wind
was
terrifying
the
lightning
and
thunder
made
me
hide
under
pillows
That
storm
was
accompanied
by
hail
that
broke
more
windows
and
ruined
more
crops
than
any
storm
in
or
around
Philadelphia
since
then
The
Camden
tornado
of
August
3
1885
did
much
more
harm
to
life
and
prop
erty
The
exact
year
of
this
great
hailstorm
I
don
t
know
I
ve
read
Hazen
s
study
The
Tornado
but
this
storm
is
not
mentioned
I
fancy
it
must
have
been
in
1870
or
1871
about
the
epoch
of
the
Franco-Prussian
War
It
was
some
years
after
the
installation
of
the
horse-car
line
on
Seventh
Street
which
I
remember
be
cause
as
car
sixty-six
went
by
I
was
told
that
the
year
was
1866
The
Franco
Prussian
War
I
can
recall
as
my
mother
an
ardent
lover
of
France
and
all
things
French
argued
the
case
with
a
neighbour
a
German
and
always
lost
her
temper
From
this
dates
my
precocious
interest
in
French
art
and
literature
and
I
lay
the
blame
on
the
Centennial
Exposition
of
mention
these
three
high-lights
war
assassination
and
tornadoes
as
proof
that
I
was
predestined
willy-nilly
to
become
a
newspaper
writer
MY
GRANDFATHERS
I
come
of
an
old-fashioned
middle-class
family
on
both
sides
notwithstanding
the
radical
Celtic
strain
My
father
John
Huneker
was
the
son
of
a
John
Hun
eker
organist
of
St
Mary
s
Roman
Catholic
Church
on
South
Fourth
Street
Somewhere
in
the
old
church
yard
is
my
grandfather
s
tomb
I
have
not
succeeded
in
finding
it
The
elder
Huneker
was
organist
in
the
year
1806
and
the
reason
I
know
is
a
letter
in
my
hand
which
is
dated
Philada
December
22nd
1806
and
quaintly
addressed
To
the
clergy
and
managers
of
St
Mary
s
Church
In
this
letter
my
grandfather
true
to
type
protests
that
since
he
is
appointed
organist
of
the
said
church
he
proposed
to
be
choir-director
or
else
The
usual
choir
row
A
certain
the
name
looks
like
Mr
Ansan
but
is
hardly
legible
had
hitherto
directed
and
instructed
the
choir
This
didn
t
suit
the
plans
of
the
old
gentleman
hence
the
protest
It
is
characteristic
of
the
Huneker
tribe
as
well
as
of
the
musical
profession
All
or
nothing
Either
Or
No
happy
medium
for
them
Steeple
jacks
Dreamers
Only
hard
knocks
from
experience
made
them
come
to
earth
How
the
dispute
was
set
tled
deponent
saith
not
but
as
my
grandfather
was
or
ganist
of
St
Mary
s
many
years
I
fancy
he
had
his
way
At
this
juncture
I
have
a
painful
duty
to
perform
Far
be
from
me
to
betray
a
lack
of
piety
in
the
matter
of
such
a
forebear
I
never
saw
him
His
daguerreotype
shows
him
to
have
been
a
well-set-up
man
with
regular
features
and
evidently
of
a
florid
complexion
He
com
posed
a
sacred
anthem
for
voice
and
organ
in
1826
Worse
remains
He
actually
published
the
composition
It
is
entitled
The
Vale
of
the
Cross
words
by
Roscoe
It
is
distinctly
bad
not
mediocre
but
stupid
indiffer
ently
written
there
are
false
progressions
banal
har
monies
and
I
regret
that
after
so
many
years
my
con
science
forces
me
to
criticise
adversely
the
work
of
an
ancestor
I
shan
t
speak
of
the
open-fifths
and
parallel
octaves
to-day
the
new
men
in
music
violate
every
rule
of
the
old
masters
need
I
refer
to
Richard
Strauss
Schoenberg
Stravinsky
But
my
grandfather
did
not
possess
the
brilliant
gifts
of
these
modern
composers
If
his
blood
didn
t
flow
in
my
veins
I
should
be
con
strained
to
add
that
his
creative
gifts
were
not
much
in
evidence
in
this
composition
no
matter
his
executive
ability
in
the
handling
of
organ
manuals
and
treading
the
pedals
otherwise
he
is
said
to
have
been
a
kindly
gentleman
With
you
I
also
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
at
accomplishing
my
duty
Later
I
fear
I
shall
be
com
pelled
by
the
same
motive
to
criticise
my
maternal
grand
father
for
his
manipulation
of
the
anapestic
measure
also
for
writing
sonnets
of
thirteen
lines
though
Sydney
Dobell
did
the
same
afterwards
In
New
York
you
ask
a
man
what
will
he
take
in
Boston
who
is
his
favourite
composer
in
Chicago
how
many
he
has
killed
that
day
but
in
my
dear
old
town
the
question
always
resolves
itself
into
were
you
born
above
or
below
Market
Street
Anyhow
this
street
was
the
social
Rubicon
when
I
was
a
boy
On
this
side
of
the
Pyrenees
Truth
on
the
other
side
Error
I
was
born
in
No
Man
s
Land
a
barbarian
in
the
outer
wilderness
But
while
the
Hunekers
were
not
of
an
aristocratic
strain
we
were
not
newcomers
in
the
land
I
wonder
how
many
fashionable
folk
in
New
York
Boston
and
Philadelphia
can
trace
their
family
back
to
the
year
1700
It
doesn
t
matter
much
but
the
blare
of
social
trumpets
still
deafen
me
when
I
visit
my
home
town
so
that
I
feel
like
querying
Did
your
family
come
over
before
or
after
the
centennial
I
used
to
ask
my
father
who
vtere
his
ancestors
His
whimsical
reply
was
Pudding-weavers
down
at
the
Neck
which
made
me
laugh
but
left
me
wondering
What
s
a
pudding
weaver
I
know
where
the
Neck
is
or
was
Hog
Island
has
an
affinity
with
such
puddings
Produce
farmers
perhaps
Oh
Chopin
Oh
Verlaine
perhaps
my
grandfather
s
father
made
blood-sausages
I
refuse
to
believe
it
only
that
subtle
allusion
to
the
weaving
of
black
pudding
Martin
I
J
Griffin
an
authority
on
historical
research
a
genealogist
particularly
interested
in
old
American
Catholic
families
wrote
my
brother
John
Huneker
that
Mark
Honyker
in
1782
gave
twenty-five
pounds
to
enlarge
St
Mary
s
Church
He
was
an
uncle
of
John
Huneker
Your
family
in
Phila
delphia
goes
back
to
1700
and
were
among
the
earliest
Catholic
settlers
A
tradition
is
that
the
family
orig
inally
stemmed
from
Hungary
then
an
autonomous
state
An
old
Viennese
Bible
dated
1750
spells
the
name
Hunykyr
though
we
can
t
claim
alliance
with
the
noblest
among
Hungarian
families
Janos
Hunyadi
Well
I
recollect
the
fear
this
bible
aroused
with
its
pictures
of
the
damned
in
hell
indeed
I
conceived
my
first
prej
udice
against
the
theological
hell
because
of
those
cruel
illustrations
There
are
various
strains
in
our
blood
in
the
paternal
line
Hungarian
English
and
no
doubt
sturdy
Pennsyl
vania
Dutch
the
Irish
blood
we
derive
from
the
distaff
side
Gibbons
and
Duffy
But
my
father
s
mother
was
a
Bowman
and
related
to
the
Coopers
From
data
furnished
by
our
second
cousin
George
E
Walton
I
learn
that
Charles
Bowman
while
a
theological
student
fled
to
America
because
of
political
opinions
and
on
June
13
1777
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
State
of
Pennsylvania
He
was
prominent
in
business
as
in
civil
and
religious
affairs
later
and
with
Messrs
Oellers
Drexel
Reufner
and
others
Charles
Bowman
became
responsible
for
the
building
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
of
the
Holy
Trinity
at
Sixth
and
Spruce
Streets
of
which
he
was
a
trustee
His
associates
withdrew
their
names
and
support
and
unfortunately
left
Bowman
to
complete
the
church
which
resulted
in
his
mental
and
financial
breakdown
He
died
broken-hearted
about
There
is
a
book
of
the
Bowman
genealogy
published
at
Harrisburg
1886
but
it
seems
that
the
Philadelphia
branch
is
separate
from
others
of
the
same
name
Charles
Bowman
married
first
Miss
Faunce
by
whom
he
had
three
daughters
Mary
Bowman
who
married
Harry
Voigt
Elizabeth
Bowman
who
married
my
grandfather
John
Huneker
Frances
Bowman
who
married
Francis
Cooper
Jr
the
maternal
grandfather
of
George
E
Walton
After
the
death
of
his
first
wife
Charles
Bow
man
married
a
widow
Mrs
Fox
who
had
a
son
John
Fox
the
father
of
the
late
Hon
Daniel
M
Fox
formerly
a
Mayor
of
Philadelphia
With
Daniel
M
Fox
I
studied
or
w
r
ent
through
the
motions
of
studying
His
sons
are
Henry
Korn
Fox
well
known
in
that
city
and
William
Henry
Fox
at
present
Director
of
Art
at
the
museum
on
the
Eastern
Parkway
Brooklyn
The
Coopers
and
Bowmans
were
patriotic
and
participated
in
the
Revo
lutionary
War
as
well
as
the
War
of
1812
Even
if
we
were
not
F
F
V
s
we
could
belong
to
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
Revolution
Some
of
us
do
Since
the
recent
happy
recrudescence
of
patriotic
sentiment
in
this
country
it
is
consoling
to
know
that
your
family
stock
is
so
deeply
rooted
in
the
native
soil
But
the
Gibbons
side
is
another
story
That
once
told
we
shall
quickly
get
afloat
on
the
stream
of
memories
The
acute
sensitiveness
the
instability
of
tempera
ment
the
alternations
of
timidity
and
rashness
the
mor
bid
exaltation
and
depression
which
were
and
still
are
the
stigmata
of
my
personal
case
as
the
psychiatrists
put
it
come
from
the
Irish
side
of
my
house
To
be
sure
the
two
months
shortage
in
normal
gestation
played
the
role
of
a
dissolvent
in
my
character
Every
human
is
a
colony
of
cells
His
personality
is
not
a
unit
but
an
aggregation
of
units
Duple
triple
sex
tuple
personalities
have
been
noted
by
psychologists
in
abnormal
cases
Yet
I
firmly
believe
this
dissociation
is
commoner
than
psychologists
would
have
us
believe
When
President
Woodrow
Wilson
spoke
of
his
single
track
mind
he
merely
proved
that
by
powerful
concen
tration
he
was
able
to
canalise
one
idea
to
focus
it
and
thus
dispose
of
it
This
inhibitory
power
is
not
possessed
by
everyone
I
for
example
have
a
polyphonic
mind
I
enjoy
the
simultaneous
flight
of
a
half-dozen
trains
of
ideas
which
run
on
parallel
tracks
for
a
certain
distance
then
disappear
arriving
nowhere
This
accounts
for
my
half-mad
worship
of
the
Seven
Arts
which
have
always
seemed
one
single
art
when
I
first
read
Walter
Pater
s
suggestion
that
all
the
other
arts
aspire
to
the
condition
c
o
SI
i
of
music
I
said
That
s
it
and
at
once
proceeded
to
write
of
painting
in
terms
of
tone
of
literature
as
if
it
were
only
form
and
color
and
of
life
as
if
it
is
a
prom
enade
of
flavours
Now
I
admit
that
this
method
apart
from
its
being
confusing
to
the
reader
is
also
aesthetically
false
It
didn
t
require
Professor
Babbitt
to
tell
us
that
in
his
New
Laocoon
The
respective
substance
of
each
art
is
different
and
not
even
the
extraordinary
genius
of
Richard
Wagner
could
fuse
disparate
dissimilarities
The
musician
in
him
dominated
the
poet
dramatist
and
scene-painter
And
in
this
paragraph
I
am
precisely
demonstrating
what
I
spoke
of
my
polyphonic
habit
of
thinking
if
thinking
it
may
be
thus
called
I
often
suffer
from
a
split
or
dissociated
personalities
hence
my
discursiveness
to
call
such
a
fugitive
ideation
by
so
mild
a
name
But
I
started
to
tell
you
of
my
maternal
grandfather
and
I
am
winding
up
on
Wagner
Talk
about
free
fantasy
in
a
modern
tone-poem

a
five
voiced
fugue

James
Gibbons
was
born
in
1801
in
Donegal
the
far
down
the
black
north
as
they
say
in
Ireland
Not
finding
the
politics
of
his
land
to
his
taste
he
did
what
millions
of
his
countrymen
have
done
he
emi
grated
to
America
This
was
in
1820
He
married
Sarah
Duffy
and
settled
in
Philadelphia
I
knew
him
slightly
but
never
had
very
strong
affection
for
him
When
he
died
in
1873
I
was
J
ust
m
mv
teens
The
man
was
reserved
haughty
and
to
my
younger
brother
Paul
and
me
he
seemed
needlessly
harsh
My
first
dislike
was
born
of
his
admonishment
that
if
we
misbehaved
or
worried
our
mother
he
would
cut
off
our
fingers
There
was
something
peculiarly
Celtic
in
this
cruel
threat
not
that
the
Irish
are
bloody-minded
or
treat
their
children
roughly
but
the
race
is
imaginative
It
deals
in
the
hyperbolical
Its
temperament
keeps
it
oscillating
twixt
hell
and
heaven
Above
all
the
gift
or
curse
of
expres
siveness
has
never
been
denied
the
Irish
They
love
highly
coloured
phrases
They
are
born
rhetoricians
from
a
Dublin
jaunting-car
driver
to
Edmund
Burke
My
grandfather
was
an
orator
He
dealt
in
superlatives
To
hear
him
declaim
his
own
patriotic
verse
it
was
patriotic
or
nothing
to
proclaim
the
wrongs
of
Emerald
Isle
to
denounce
the
enemy
the
Sassenach
Ah
where
would
George
Moore
have
been
with
his
Erse
and
his
aristocratic
condescension
to
the
men
of
County
Mayo
My
relative
was
seldom
so
exuberant
His
hatred
for
Eng
land
and
the
English
is
historical
among
his
sympathisers
Probably
the
gravest
defect
in
my
character
is
my
in
ability
to
hate
anyone
or
anything
for
more
than
five
minutes
except
hypocrisy
and
noise
They
say
a
man
who
can
t
hate
can
t
love
I
don
t
subscribe
to
that
Probably
I
come
by
my
indifferent
temperament
from
my
father
who
would
curse
like
a
sea-pilot
and
in
a
change
of
breath
caress
the
cat
Here
Pussy
he
would
say
after
consigning
to
the
demnition
bow-wows
one
of
his
workmen
But
I
can
love
intensely
love
an
idea
or
an
art
I
am
a
Yes-Sayer
The
fulminations
of
my
granddaddy
never
got
under
my
skin
Occasionally
he
would
take
me
on
his
knees
bony
they
were
and
hurt
me
and
thus
adjure
me
James
you
are
my
grandson
and
named
after
me
Never
forget
the
accursed
enemies
of
your
country
Meaning
the
English
I
promised
him
naturally
and
ever
since
have
bravely
battled
with
the
English
lan
guage
the
charmed
tongue
of
Chaucer
Shakespeare
and
Swinburne
and
I
am
always
defeated
in
the
verbal
fray
A
martyr
to
English
literature
and
Irish
patriotism
I
recall
certain
long
summer
afternoons
the
babble
of
men
s
voices
the
cigar
smoke
and
the
clinking
of
glasses
when
a
Fenian
pow-wow
was
held
in
our
dining
room
I
also
remember
the
cynical
smile
of
my
father
who
detested
Fenianism
with
its
blow
brag
and
bluster
He
knew
I
have
since
discovered
that
the
sincerity
of
my
grandfather
couldn
t
be
challenged
But
my
father
distrusted
some
of
the
patriots
who
surrounded
James
Gibbons
And
justly
so
Joseph
Conrad
has
said
that
in
every
revolution
the
bad
characters
come
first
to
the
surface
This
is
particularly
true
of
the
Fenian
move
ment
of
the
sixties
As
to
the
validity
of
the
cause
I
may
say
nothing
But
the
patriotic
motives
of
such
men
as
James
Gibbons
Patrick
J
Meehan
editor
of
The
Irish
American
James
Stephens
the
Head-Centre
of
the
European
Fenian
Brotherhood
he
died
about
1901
of
General
Sweeney
Charles
Roberts
John
O
Neill
and
many
others
no
one
could
impugn
James
Gibbons
was
the
vice-president
of
the
American
branch
of
the
Brother
hood
and
while
he
was
not
a
rich
man
he
had
an
abun
dant
income
from
his
printing-press
on
Chestnut
Street
That
thriving
business
was
swallowed
up
by
the
patri
ots
who
did
not
then
disdain
as
they
do
not
disdain
to
day
the
humble
savings
of
the
servant-girl
I
speak
by
the
card
for
I
have
often
heard
my
grandfather
savagely
attack
these
blood-suckers
who
with
the
flag
of
the
Emer
ald
Isle
how
often
I
have
been
dazzled
by
that
golden
sunburst
in
one
hand
outstretched
the
other
greedily
grasping
the
pennies
of
the
deluded
Irish
lads
and
lassies
whose
hearts
were
bigger
than
their
brainpans
James
Gibbons
sacrificed
his
money
his
family
him
self
in
the
vain
pursuit
of
patriotism
He
was
called
the
Irish
Poet
Patriot
and
Printer
and
while
his
powers
as
a
poet
are
not
considerable
he
put
such
vehement
passion
into
his
utterances
that
one
must
overlook
his
limping
and
monotonous
verse
I
hold
in
my
hand
a
small
unbound
book
bearing
the
title
Miscellaneous
and
Pa
triotic
Poems
by
James
Gibbons
Printed
for
private
circulation
1870
A
harp
decorates
the
green
cover
Also
a
quatrain
beginning
Oh
harp
of
my
country
the
pride
of
her
sages
and
the
last
line
Thy
music
still
lives
in
each
Irishman
s
soul
On
the
fly-leaf
is
the
following
written
in
an
abominable
scrawl
I
know
from
whom
I
inherited
my
handwriting
To
my
dear
grand
son
Master
James
Huneker
with
the
affectionate
re
gards
of
his
grandfather
Rather
touching
isn
t
it
from
a
man
who
never
considered
his
family
friends
or
self-interest
when
confronted
by
his
duty
to
the
cause
who
dreamed
Ireland
Free
ate
drank
and
lived
with
the
idea
Only
Erin
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
His
was
a
fanaticism
that
would
have
ennobled
a
baser
cause
and
the
Lord
only
knows
the
Quid
Sod
has
its
grievances
But
to
capture
the
British
Empire
via
Canada
has
also
seemed
to
me
as
it
did
to
my
father
the
maddest
of
dreams
The
Irish
and
the
Polish
are
of
spiritual
kin
patriotically
Individualists
they
are
never
happy
under
any
form
of
government
However
James
Gibbons
and
his
associates
did
not
think
this
nor
were
they
discouraged
after
the
first
dis
astrous
battle
in
Canada
England
was
not
the
only
object
of
my
grandfather
s
abhorrence
He
was
a
vio
lent
nay
a
virulent
prohibitionist
they
called
them
selves
Temperance
Advocates
in
those
days
but
they
nowise
differed
as
to
intemperate
speech
from
the
pro
hibitfonfsts
of
1919
All
fanatics
are
alike
The
truth
is
seldom
their
aim
They
become
propagandists
no
matter
the
silliness
inutility
or
the
positive
evil
of
their
cause
Consider
the
anti-vivisectionists
the
opponents
to
vac
cination
or
any
such
baleful
cults
James
Gibbons
as
his
obituaries
tell
me
and
as
I
know
by
word
of
mouth
from
my
mother
was
largely
instrumental
in
bringing
Father
Matthew
to
this
country
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
Our
family
has
or
had
many
letters
from
that
great
apostle
of
temperance
Father
Matthew
also
from
Archbishop
McHale
to
James
Gibbons
who
was
a
member
of
St
Augustine
s
Church
a
half
century
and
an
active
and
zealous
worker
in
St
Vincent
de
Paul
s
Society
for
an
equal
period
He
was
devoted
to
the
succour
of
poor
orphans
and
I
often
heard
his
poem
The
Lament
of
the
Orphan
Boy
recited
or
sung
The
rind
of
the
man
was
sometimes
forbidding
he
had
suffered
from
many
disillusionments
but
his
heart
was
as
sentimental
as
an
Irishman
s
only
can
be
I
have
seen
his
eyes
fill
at
the
mention
of
a
child
s
sorrow
or
of
Ireland
At
his
funeral
the
organist
of
St
Augus
tine
s
Henry
Thunder
the
father
of
the
present
con
ductor
and
organist
Henry
Gordon
Thunder
played
The
Exile
of
Erin
He
was
an
exile
his
life
long
and
if
he
had
remained
in
Ireland
he
would
have
died
either
from
disgust
or
on
the
gallows
There
was
short
shrift
for
traitors
in
1820
But
to
these
poems
they
are
dedicated
to
his
daugh
ter
Mary
Gibbons
Huneker
The
author
calls
them
fugitive
pieces
and
they
are
Most
of
them
are
dog
gerel
though
the
best
are
marked
by
unfeigned
pathos
and
burning
sincerity
Those
are
musical
to
the
ear
written
in
the
simpler
forms
and
strongly
influenced
by
Tom
Moore
Campbell
and
Byron
Tis
sad
to
say
farewell
love
Thy
absence
gives
me
pain
was
once
upon
a
time
a
popular
song
It
has
a
tuneful
jingle
that
is
pleasing
if
not
too
original
I
like
the
image
When
the
stars
hung
out
their
silver
lamps
above
the
dark
blue
sea
even
if
h
is
since
faded
to
fatuity
There
is
a
poem
dedicated
to
ex-President
Tyler
we
were
intimate
with
the
Tyler
family
but
the
gem
of
the
collection
is
A
Dream
which
appeared
in
the
Philadelphia
Evening
Journal
April
22
1863
I
wonder
why
they
didn
t
hang
the
poet
from
a
lamp-post
It
was
during
the
Civil
War
and
a
year
of
red-hot
partisan
ship
The
Copperhead
was
an
outcast
Abraham
Lin
coln
had
not
been
canonised
by
martyrdom
Nor
had
he
been
idealised
He
was
plain
Old
Abe
and
half
mockingly
half-affectionately
called
The
Rail-Splitter
He
was
caricatured
abused
in
print
and
fathered
with
many
a
doubtful
joke
But
he
was
also
the
Old
Abe
who
penned
the
Emancipation
Proclamation
the
Old
Abe
who
delivered
the
Gettysburg
speech
the
English
of
which
has
not
been
bettered
by
any
one
of
his
suc
cessors
in
the
White
House
an
English
which
came
from
the
Bible
and
Bunyan
and
hot
from
the
heart
of
the
great
man
who
wrote
it
Therefore
my
astonishment
is
all
the
greater
that
punishment
swift
condign
did
not
follow
the
publication
of
the
vitriolic
verses
signed
by
James
Gibbons
and
doubtless
inspired
by
that
other
James
S
Gibbons
a
Quaker
who
composed
the
once
famous
lines
beginning
We
are
coming
Father
Abram
My
grandfather
s
amended
version
began
We
are
coming
Abram
Lincoln
with
the
ghosts
of
murdered
men
I
repeat
I
wonder
how
he
escaped
death
or
imprisonment
Both
were
summarily
dealt
to
men
for
a
less
offence
That
was
the
time
when
Secre
tary
of
War
Stanton
is
reported
to
have
made
his
speech
When
I
tap
this
little
bell
I
can
send
a
man
to
a
place
where
he
will
never
hear
the
dogs
bark
I
quote
from
an
exceptionally
treacherous
memory
But
if
a
noncon
formist
James
Gibbons
was
a
loyal
citizen
and
not
against
our
government
I
fancy
the
fact
that
he
was
a
poet
saved
Mr
Gib
bons
from
punishment
The
other
verse
in
his
little
book
is
harmless
enough
A
National
Temperance
Song
dedicated
to
Francis
Cooper
Esq
a
relative
the
music
by
B
Cross
the
father
of
the
late
Michall
Hurley
Cross
fills
my
cup
to
overflowing
A
Gibbons
a
poet
even
a
poetaster
is
credible
enough
but
a
Gibbons
a
prohibitionist
is
flying
in
the
very
face
of
probability
Yet
it
was
so
Before
the
Fenian
movement
netted
him
he
was
often
on
the
temperance
platform
sometimes
in
company
with
Father
Matthew
It
is
the
only
blot
in
our
scutcheon
a
reformer
among
the
Gibbons
and
Hunekers
And
a
temperance
reformer
The
pity
of
it
I
much
prefer
the
admirable
attitude
of
James
Cardinal
Gibbons
of
Baltimore
a
connection
of
my
grandfather
s
who
has
pointed
out
that
true
temperance
is
to
be
found
in
moderation
not
in
total
prohibition
So
fierce
were
the
sentiments
of
James
Gibbons
on
his
darling
themes
of
temperance
and
patriotism
that
at
a
meeting
of
Irish-Americans
in
Buffalo
while
he
was
ad
dressing
his
audience
the
floor
fell
in
carrying
with
it
the
concourse
of
patriots
But
the
orator
undismayed
hung
on
to
a
window-sill
and
continued
his
passionate
address
on
the
wrongs
of
Ireland
This
anecdote
may
be
apocryphal
I
never
heard
how
many
were
wounded
in
the
affair
It
was
said
afterwards
that
to
kill
a
Gib
bons
the
only
sure
way
was
to
heave
a
brick
at
his
head
when
one
of
the
tribe
was
caught
praying
This
is
an
oM
Donegal
superstition
But
though
the
family
can
boost
several
ecclesiastics
not
one
has
been
over
taken
in
prayer
by
an
enemy
Nor
by
the
same
token
have
any
of
the
Hunekers
Among
my
grandfather
s
papers
I
found
a
copy
of
a
letter
dated
November
8
1867
and
addressed
to
His
Excellency
Andrew
Johnson
President
of
the
United
State
The
handwriting
is
that
of
my
mother
who
wrote
many
a
State
paper
for
her
father
In
this
letter
the
writer
airs
his
usual
grievance
Prominent
Republicans
have
left
nothing
undone
to
seduce
by
flattery
and
fair
promises
the
Fenian
or
Irish
vote
from
its
allegiance
to
the
constitutional
party
of
the
country
how
far
they
have
been
successful
the
late
elections
will
answer
Gibbons
then
makes
an
appeal
to
crush
the
enemies
of
Ireland
in
the
country
and
stop
the
insidious
tyranny
of
England
I
need
not
remind
your
Excellency
that
England
has
never
acknowledged
citizen
ship
in
an
Irishman
when
her
interest
or
her
hate
stood
in
the
way
Toujours
England
Whether
President
Andy
as
he
was
endearingly
called
by
an
ungrateful
constituency
ever
took
action
in
the
matter
I
can
t
say
I
play
Bach
fugues
every
morning
after
breakfast
but
my
technique
in
American
history
still
leaves
much
to
be
desired
Another
letter
which
throws
light
on
the
man
and
contemporary
events
came
to
me
from
Richard
McCIoud
aUorm
y-at-J
v.v
Duranr
o
Colorado
ft
is
dated
May
May
1909
I
came
across
your
portrait
and
learned
that
you
were
born
in
Philadelphia
and
that
one
of
your
grandfathers
was
an
Irishman
a
poet
and
also
vice
president
of
the
Fenian
Brotherhood
some
time
in
the
early
seventies
That
grandfather
and
I
were
great
friends
I
was
one
of
the
Senators
of
the
Fenian
Brother
hood
and
one
Sunday
in
1870
a
short
time
before
the
last
raid
on
Canada
the
Senators
had
a
meeting
in
Philadelphia
at
the
house
of
your
grandfather
He
was
a
good
speaker
on
many
subjects
I
lived
in
New
York
and
had
a
desk
in
the
Custom
House
and
was
a
student
in
the
Columbia
College
Law
School
James
Gibbons
to
attend
a
Fenian
convention
called
by
the
Senators
to
stop
the
second
raid
on
Canada
proposed
by
President
John
O
Neill
of
the
Brotherhood
I
got
passes
for
Mr
Gibbons
and
myself
from
New
York
to
Chicago
on
the
New
York
Central
Road
through
Canada
to
Detroit
etc
I
had
two
small
tin
boxes
containing
all
the
Fenian
papers
for
the
convention
brought
from
headquarters
in
New
York
Mr
Gibbons
and
I
sat
together
in
the
train
After
we
crossed
Suspension
Bridge
at
Niagara
Falls
the
Custom
House
officers
were
coming
through
the
cars
and
Mr
Gibbons
became
uneasy
and
said
to
me
that
we
would
be
arrested
because
of
the
Fenian
papers
I
quieted
him
by
showing
him
that
my
passes
were
granted
because
of
the
New
York
Custom
House
and
that
the
boxes
would
not
be
examined
And
so
it
hap
pened
when
the
Canadian
officers
reached
our
seat
However
on
our
return
we
did
not
pass
through
Canada
as
we
were
watched
by
Pinkerton
detectives
from
Chi
cago
as
we
learned
from
private
sources
James
Gib
bons
was
a
true
Irish
patriot
and
sacrificed
bis
printing
business
for
the
cause
of
Ireland
I
was
married
in
1870
after
the
second
raid
on
Canada
and
my
best
man
was
Joseph
I
C
Clarke
of
New
York
city
who
has
since
made
a
reputation
as
a
literary
man
My
father-in-law
is
still
living
and
he
was
a
great
friend
of
James
Gibbons
who
was
frequently
entertained
at
his
residence
in
Norwich
Conn
His
name
is
Michael
McQuirk
Excuse
this
screed
Yours
Richard
McCIoud
A
brave
old
friend
I
hope
he
still
lives
The
Clarke
alluded
to
is
no
less
a
personage
than
J
I
C
Clarke
formerly
editor
of
the
New
York
Journal
poet
orator
and
patriot
James
Gibbons
was
of
medium
height
as
lithe
and
swift
as
an
Indian
swarthy
of
skin
his
eyes
grey-blue
his
hair
white
and
primly
parted
his
expres
sion
stern
yet
his
glance
was
the
glance
of
a
visionary
He
was
a
visionary
Another
steeplejack
A
dreamer
of
that
wildest
of
dreams
the
political
separation
of
Ireland
from
England
He
spoke
with
eloquence
He
was
logical
His
familiar
pose
was
that
of
a
statesman
his
right
hand
thrust
in
his
frock
coat
I
think
about
his
only
weakness
was
his
belief
that
he
resembled
his
politi
cal
idol
Henry
Clay
There
was
sufficient
resemblance
to
justify
this
belief
He
was
a
man
of
character
and
intellect
No
Celtic
instability
there
He
was
as
stub
born
and
unyielding
in
his
faiths
religious
and
patriotic
as
the
rock
of
Gibraltar
With
his
brains
and
iron
will
he
should
have
risen
to
eminence
in
any
profession
whether
the
law
politics
or
the
church
I
think
that
he
would
have
made
a
model
bishop
But
he
preferred
to
follow
his
dream
a
beautiful
unselfish
dream
all
the
more
beautiful
because
it
was
unrealised
He
was
ex
ploited
by
a
conscienceless
crew
With
his
imagination
he
was
doomed
to
be
a
leader
of
forlorn
hopes
Ah
the
Wild
Goose
which
George
Moore
calls
the
symbol
of
the
restless
Irish
temperament
Despite
his
occasional
chilliness
I
revere
the
memory
of
the
man
though
I
shall
never
forget
the
cruel
image
evoked
by
him
My
hands
were
my
petty
vanity
I
was
called
a
fingersmith
good
old
Northern
Liberty
word
and
to
chop
off
those
fingers
seemed
the
acme
of
the
horrible
He
didn
t
mean
it
It
was
his
heightened
and
Celtic
way
of
say
ing
things
James
Gibbons
was
a
fighter
born
till
the
day
of
his
death
he
fought
windmills
and
like
the
noble
Spanish
Don
of
Cervantes
he
never
knew
they
were
windmills
He
thought
it
was
for
humanity
s
sake
And
it
was
for
suffering
humanity
that
he
fought
with
out
a
thought
of
self
or
ultimate
success
Of
such
rare
and
heroic
stuff
was
he
fashioned
Ill
FAMILY
LIFE
These
retrospective
hallucinations
would
be
incom
plete
without
an
account
of
my
parents
not
of
over
whelming
interest
to
you
but
it
is
to
me
hence
its
in
clusion
in
these
pages
Stendhal
has
said
that
a
man
s
first
enemies
are
his
parents
and
there
is
just
enough
truth
in
the
paradox
to
lend
it
wings
We
are
the
product
of
inherited
tendencies
to
give
to
an
unknown
quantity
a
word
we
are
usually
brought
up
to
believe
what
our
fathers
and
mothers
believed
They
are
our
pacemakers
in
life
Their
religious
faith
is
thrust
upon
us
without
our
asking
Their
prejudices
social
political
are
ours
It
is
a
man
or
woman
of
character
who
breaks
away
early
from
the
yoke
supposing
that
it
is
a
yoke
and
that
our
beliefs
are
sincere
But
the
profound
im
pressions
of
childhood
are
seldom
erased
You
may
fight
your
life
long
against
them
and
uselessly
I
who
am
not
of
what
is
euphemistically
called
the
religious
temperament
can
not
pass
a
church
without
saluting
and
often
entering
Two
rituals
fascinate
me
The
Hebrew
and
the
Roman
Catholic
In
Paris
I
went
to
the
Greek
church
and
occasionally
in
New
York
The
liturgical
chants
first
sung
when
mankind
was
in
its
infancy
before
Egypt
was
and
perhaps
during
the
Atlantean
golden
age
are
echoed
in
the
KoI-Nidrei
of
the
Day
of
Atonement
and
in
the
Dies
Irse
of
Passion
Week
The
call
of
the
Muezzin
from
the
minaret
of
the
Ma
hometan
mosque
is
a
cry
that
has
sounded
down
the
corridor
of
time
from
immemorial
days
and
lands
that
vanished
in
the
last
glacial
epoch
The
soul
of
man
is
older
than
his
handiwork
and
his
soul
has
always
aspired
after
the
vision
Totem
and
fetish
tabu
magic
animism
and
idols
are
incorporated
in
the
solemn
church
services
of
to-day
Religious
emotion
is
as
old
as
humanity
Baudelaire
would
not
permit
his
friends
to
mock
his
gro
tesque
wooden
idol
because
as
he
whispered
a
god
might
be
concealed
in
it
The
idea
of
divinity
lurking
every
where
was
one
of
the
charms
of
the
pagan
world
Man
was
accomplice
in
the
eternal
mysteries
Religion
that
most
ancient
and
jealous
thing
was
a
forest
peopled
by
gods
pluralistic
deities
Some
men
outlive
this
feeling
I
can
not
And
the
aesthetic
symbolism
of
the
Mass
is
alluring
But
suppose
that
it
would
have
been
pos
sible
to
have
consulted
me
at
the
age
of
understand
ing
Would
I
have
subscribed
to
the
tenets
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
Or
to
take
a
commoner
example
was
I
asked
whether
I
preferred
being
a
Democrat
or
Republican
Stendhal
is
not
so
far
wrong
in
his
as
sumption
though
in
his
personal
case
he
was
the
victim
of
a
cruel
illiberal
father
and
a
nasty-tempered
nagging
aunt
This
was
his
Aunt
Seraphina
made
famous
in
his
journals
For
his
mother
he
entertained
a
feeling
that
edged
the
idolatrous
I
was
luckier
than
Henry
Beyle
of
Grenoble
My
parents
were
not
my
enemies
To
them
I
owe
everything
My
love
of
pictorial
art
was
fostered
at
home
my
passion
for
music
stimulated
in
a
musical
atmosphere
My
father
was
an
easy-going
man
with
a
waggish
dis
position
and
a
large
fund
of
dry
humour
which
found
expression
in
pithy
if
not
always
parliamentary
expres
sions
He
called
a
cat
a
cat
as
they
say
in
Paris
and
sometimes
the
names
of
his
cats
evoked
a
shudder
but
the
shudder
always
resolved
itself
into
laughter
Those
shrewd
crisp
vocables
born
somewhere
in
old
Kensing
ton
hurt
our
ear
when
they
impinged
too
sharply
on
the
tympani
Yet
they
usually
disposed
of
a
variety
of
upstart
pretension
of
false
sentiment
This
John
Hun
eker
hated
humbug
His
hatred
was
not
of
the
bilious
corroding
kind
but
gay
sometimes
too
broad
in
speech
and
ever
salutary
He
had
a
barytone
voice
rich
vi
brant
and
like
little
Galli-Curci
he
occasionally
sang
off
the
pitch
It
wasn
t
as
much
I
fear
lack
of
method
as
some
aural
defect
Nevertheless
he
was
in
great
demand
at
social
gatherings
where
he
won
applause
by
his
imitations
of
Italian
opera
singers
My
memory
cells
can
still
recall
his
singing
of
buffo
arias
side-splitting
in
their
innocent
fun-making
Also
many
old-fashioned
English
ballads
The
White
Squall
My
Boyhood
s
Home
The
Ivy
Green
His
Down
Among
the
Dead
Men
was
justly
esteemed
It
would
have
won
favour
from
Colonel
Newcome
in
any
Cave
of
Har
mony
And
those
caves
were
prevalent
in
the
early
forties
of
the
past
century
Philadelphia
boasted
a
dozen
a
combination
of
chop-house
tavern
and
concert
room
There
was
a
chairman
usually
some
well-known
booze-fighter
and
all-round
genial
with
a
resonant
voice
or
else
some
actor
Billy
Burton
among
the
great
est
of
Falstaffs
like
the
elder
Hackett
and
Edgar
Poe
s
employer
on
Burton
s
Magazine
was
an
admirable
host
The
convivial
gentlemen
damned
the
King
and
drank
toasts
to
the
memory
of
Washington
Black-Eyed
Susan
was
their
favourite
theatrical
entertainment
though
when
it
came
to
heavy
tragedy
then
the
phalanx
turned
out
to
welcome
Edmund
as
well
as
the
younger
Kean
or
the
elder
Booth
Many
a
time
I
have
listened
to
my
father
s
stirring
stories
of
the
Macready-Forrest
row
He
espoused
the
cause
of
the
English
actor
principally
because
of
his
love
of
fair
play
Macready
was
badly
treated
All
that
Dickens
wrote
of
our
intolerance
and
rough
manners
was
exemplified
in
the
Macready
affair
Feeling
never
ran
so
high
in
Philadelphia
as
it
did
in
New
York
witness
the
Astor
Place
riots
but
it
was
pretty
bad
In
reality
my
father
considered
Edwin
Forrest
the
more
powerful
actor
of
the
pair
Macready
he
said
was
cold
his
art
cerebral
If
Forrest
had
not
the
polish
he
possessed
dramatic
temperament
How
he
could
thunder
in
the
index
whether
in
Othello
Lear
or
Metamora
He
tore
passions
to
shreds
but
he
communicated
thrills
to
his
audience
He
was
before
my
time
as
an
actor
but
I
saw
him
once
at
his
home
in
North
Broad
Street
With
a
lot
of
boys
I
sat
on
his
brownstone
steps
of
a
warm
Sunday
af
ternoon
No
doubt
Mr
Forrest
was
long-suffering
in
the
matter
for
suddenly
to
our
dismay
the
door
opened
and
a
terrible-appearing
old
ogre
with
disordered
hair
shouted
in
a
voice
that
might
have
been
heard
on
Girard
Avenue
Get
out
of
here
you
blankety
blank
blank
blank
We
got
out
of
there
and
swiftly
Richelieu
was
never
more
wrathful
Lear
more
tragic
Of
the
elder
Booth
my
father
related
that
one
Sunday
morning
on
Walnut
Street
opposite
the
now
historical
theatre
his
attention
was
arrested
by
the
clattering
of
hoofs
and
the
sound
of
many
footsteps
A
crowd
swept
around
Ninth
Street
following
a
horse
upon
which
sat
or
rather
crouched
old
Booth
who
faced
backward
holding
on
literally
for
dear
life
to
the
tail
of
the
animal
It
was
one
of
the
accustomed
outbursts
of
the
great
actor
a
uric-acid
storm
the
specialists
now
call
it
The
following
Monday
evening
he
played
a
Shakesperian
character
none
the
worse
for
his
experience
There
were
giants
in
those
days
Music
while
never
a
profession
of
my
father
s
as
it
was
of
my
grandfather
played
a
pleasant
role
in
his
life
His
voice
and
amiable
personality
brought
him
into
the
best
company
of
the
town
He
belonged
to
the
Poe
circle
Judge
Conrad
William
Burton
John
Sartain
the
engraver
who
has
written
of
the
men
at
these
gather
ings
Poe
himself
Booth
and
Pierce
Butler
Judge
Conrad
would
recite
the
Lord
s
Prayer
in
a
way
that
moved
Booth
to
tears
My
father
would
sing
As
I
View
Now
Those
Scenes
so
Charming
from
Sonnam
bula
the
battle-horse
of
the
barytone
Badiali
And
if
Poe
was
not
too
sullen
or
melancholy
he
would
recite
The
Raven
and
freeze
the
spines
of
the
company
As
I
have
told
elsewhere
my
father
confessed
that
he
never
saw
Poe
the
worse
for
liquor
except
once
and
then
it
was
a
thimbleful
of
brandy
that
disturbed
his
equilib
rium
A
handsome
dapper
little
man
reported
my
father
of
Poe
s
person
and
a
sad
reticent
man
with
the
fixed
glance
of
one
immersed
in
doleful
memories
and
an
eye
that
was
beautiful
in
colour
and
the
saddest
that
he
ever
saw
When
Edwin
Booth
played
Hamlet
he
looked
like
Poe
I
was
informed
not
a
physical
but
a
spiritual
resemblance
my
father
probably
meant
My
father
entertained
all
the
visiting
musical
celeb
rities
He
knew
Thalberg
Louis
Moreau
Gottschalk
Vieuxtemps
and
a
host
of
others
Ole
Bull
went
around
our
dining-table
on
his
thumbs
his
feet
free
from
the
floor
He
was
an
athlete
this
grand
old
Norwegian
violinist
who
looked
like
Liszt
or
the
enchanted
Merlin
as
pictured
by
Burne-Jones
He
was
a
bit
of
a
char
latan
in
his
old
age
and
played
all
sorts
of
tricks
on
his
magic
fiddle
But
he
touched
the
hearts
of
his
audiences
with
Home
Sweet
Home
Way
Down
Upon
the
Suwanee
River
Old
Dan
Tucker
with
his
reels
jigs
and
once
in
a
while
a
Paganini
caprice
He
never
to
use
a
homely
expression
played
over
the
heads
of
the
people
There
was
his
secret
Art
could
go
hang
My
father
heartily
approved
of
this
attitude
Naturally
I
did
not
Art
for
me
was
cryptic
else
it
was
not
art
Many
the
battle
we
had
on
this
not
very
subtle
question
in
aesthetics
Thalberg
in
company
with
Madame
Lagrange
played
with
unqualified
success
He
knew
his
public
and
tickled
the
ears
of
the
groundlings
with
his
fantasias
and
variations
on
popular
operatic
airs
The
prayer
from
Rossini
s
Moses
in
Egypt
was
a
favourite
and
as
played
by
the
greatest
singer
on
the
keyboard
Thalberg
had
the
mellowest
touch
among
his
contemporaries
and
with
his
lyric
thumbs
he
in
toned
the
melody
He
had
studied
with
the
harpist
Parrish
Alvars
who
like
Bochsa
also
a
harpist
was
a
visitor
to
America
Arpeggios
coupled
with
a
lovely
touch
in
cantilena
and
an
impeccable
technique
made
this
virtuoso
the
sensation
of
his
time
A
natural
son
of
Prince
Dietrichstein
an
Austrian
magnate
by
a
cele
brated
Italian
opera
singer
Sigismund
Thalberg
was
not
only
rich
but
an
aristocrat
born
When
he
appeared
my
mother
sat
in
the
audience
an
interested
spectator
for
the
reason
that
her
husband
was
on
the
stage
and
figured
in
the
programme
Why
there
s
John
she
exclaimed
as
the
pianist
emerged
The
resemblance
is
striking
I
have
the
old
photographs
of
both
men
Mutton
chop
whiskers
were
in
vogue
with
high
neck
cloths
and
watch
chains
that
wound
serpentine
fashion
about
the
wearer
s
waistcoat
And
like
Thalberg
my
father
was
slightly
bald
ox-eyed
and
aquiline
of
visage
At
one
concert
Gottschalk
fresh
from
Paris
a
pupil
of
Camille
Stamaty
he
never
studied
with
Chopin
as
bi
ographers
say
but
he
played
for
Chopin
and
heard
that
marvellous
Pole
play
the
reason
I
speak
by
the
card
is
because
I
asked
a
pupil
of
Chopin
s
Georges
Mathias
in
Paris
and
he
assured
me
that
Gottschalk
then
con
sidered
a
brilliant
talent
was
never
under
the
tuition
of
Chopin
with
Thalberg
played
the
elder
pianist
s
fantasia
on
themes
from
Nor
ma
arranged
for
two
pianos
and
my
father
remembered
the
difference
of
the
scale-passages
Thalberg
s
scales
were
a
string
of
pearls
the
scales
of
the
New
Orleans
virtuoso
were
glittering
star-dust
Louis
Gottschalk
with
whose
family
I
was
intimate
had
a
more
dramatic
temperament
than
Thal
berg
who
was
impassive
and
a
believer
in
Baudelaire
s
line
Je
hais
le
mouvement
qui
deplace
les
lignes
Linear
his
art
rather
than
colourful
yet
his
touch
was
golden
In
Gottschalk
s
playing
there
was
something
Lisztian
and
diabolic
I
was
taken
to
many
concerts
and
operas
by
my
father
and
when
he
didn
t
take
me
I
sneaked
away
and
paid
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
to
hear
singers
and
pianists
and
violinists
who
by
any
reasonable
standard
of
com
parison
would
be
worth
ten
dollars
to
listen
to
in
1919
There
is
no
Carlotta
Patti
there
may
be
equals
of
Vieuxtemps
but
not
in
grace
or
finesse
and
I
defy
you
to
find
me
a
second
Anton
Rubinstein
In
1869
I
think
Carlotta
Patti
sang
the
Queen
of
the
Night
in
Mozart
s
Magic
Flute
at
the
Academy
In
the
cast
were
Formes
Hablemann
and
the
formidable
basso
Herr
man
The
opera
was
sung
in
Italian
Never
shall
I
forget
the
prima
donna
who
limped
down
a
practicable
staircase
to
the
footlights
and
then
showered
on
our

There
was
no
doubt
about
her
F
in
altissimo
clear
round
and
frosty
She
was
a
cold
singer
the
very
timbre
of
her
voice
was
icy
when
compared
with
the
warmer
richer
or
gan
of
her
more
celebrated
sister
Adelina
But
Carlotta
was
the
more
brilliant
of

two
an
incomparable

whose
memory
has
not
been
dis
turbed
even
by

Carlotta
visited
us
later
with
Theodore
Ritter
a
polished
pianist
and
for
the
last
time
in
company
with
her

a
violoncellist
De

by

This
was
during
the
decade
of
the
eighties
The
third

Amalia
Patti-Strakosch
was
a
contralto
I
never
heard
her
sing
The
only
son
by
Caterina
Barili
s
marriage
with
Salvatore
Patti
was
Carlo
Patti
a
violinist
who
married
in
1859
the
actress
Effie
Germon
My
father
praised
Caterina
Barili
as
a
dramatic
soprano
By
her
first
marriage
she
had
the
two
Barilis
Antonio
and
Ettore
both
operatic
singers
the
last
named
a
famous
Rigoletto
He
became
choir-master
of
St
John
s
Church
and
taught
many
singers
His
son
Alfredo
Barili
went
to
Cologne
where
he
studied
under
Ferdinand
Hiller
the
composer-pianist
oh
Hiller
s
F
sharp
minor
Concerto
how
I
loathe
your
smug
Mendelssohnian
melodies
your
prim
passage-work
and
in
Paris
with
Theodore
Ritter
then
a
friend
of
his
Aunt
Carlotta
s
once
at
a
Turkish
bath
the
frolicsome
Alfredo
turned
a
hose
on
his
pre
ceptor
with
consequences
too
awful
to
relate
I
think
his
aunt
stopped
his
spending-money
for
a
month
He
is
now
in
Atlanta
A
younger
brother
Henry
is
a
singing
teacher
Alfredo
Barili
was
patient
and
friendly
enough
to
give
me
piano
lessons
and
made
a
prediction
that
came
true
when
he
assured
me
that
I
would
never
become
a
pianist
worth
hearing
The
Academy
of

has
not
changed
much
since
the
days
of

The

Only
the
ventilation-plant
and
the
tablets
in
the
lobby
to
the
memory
of
Michael
Cross
Charles
Jar
vis
and
Fritz
Scheel
made
me
conscious
of
the
pass
ing
years
A
half
century
before
I
had
declaimed
with
schoolboy
fervour
from
the
historical
stage
some
piece
or
other
at
the
commencement
exercises
of
my
school
Roth
s
Military
Academy
I
then
and
there
made
a
blighting
failure
as
an
incipient
elocutionist
and
a
bud
ding
actor
But
when
I
came
out
in
Locust
Street
last
year
and
saw
Sautter
s
where
as
a
lad
I
doted
on
the
ice
cream
and
cake
the
illusion
of
the
stability
of
youth
was
renewed
In
New
York
a
week
suffices

in
Philadelphia
the
tone
of
time
longer
endures
BLACK
AND
WHITE
When
in
1
894
my
father
s
collection
of
black
and
white
was
sold
at
New
York
the
catalogue
enumerated
several
thousand
pieces
mezzotints
line-engravings
etchings
and
lithographs
It
was
not
a
large
but
an
important
gathering
AH
schools
were
represented
Quality
ruled
Knowing
that
with
his
means
he
could
not
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
a
gallery
of
paintings
he
wisely
went
in
for
engravings
That
collection
not
only
educated
my
eye
educated
me
in
the
various
schools
but
it
gave
me
the
first
aesthetic
thrill
of
my
life
The
walls
of
our
house
were
hung
with
choice
specimens
of
the
gravers
art
I
ate
my
meals
facing
an
old
mezzotint
of
John
Martin
The
Fall
of
Nineveh
a
huge
plate
coarse
as
to
tech
nique
disorderly
in
composition
yet
revealing
an
imagi
nation
monstrous
perhaps
though
none
the
less
stirring
Both
Charles
Lamb
and
Macaulay
have
commented
upon
the
grandiose
visions
of
the
eccentric
English
mez
zotinter
Melodramatic
violent
morbid
these
same
visions
gripped
all
England
for
a
brief
period
during
the
early
Victorian
days
Not
a
colourist
the
designs
of
John
Martin
show
him
to
have
been
a
Turner
a
rebours
His
predilection
for
biblical
and
Miltonic
subjects
was
the
outcome
of
a
mind
deeply
saturated
by
religion
His
vast
temples
his
multitudes
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
the
horrific
happenings
must
have
endeared
him
to
Poe
as
they
did
to
Wordsworth
However
he
was
not
a
first-class
mezzotinter
In
none
of
his
work
is
to
be
found
the
velvety
tone
of
Richard
Earlom
or
the
rich
col
our
suggestions
of
Valentine
Green
Bituminous
blacks
and
glaring
whites
his
mezzotints
are
not
unlike
his
paint
ings
But
their
glory
is
their
vivid
dream-architecture
as
is
the
same
in
Piranesi
s
plates
In
our
living-room
then
called
the
sitting-room
there
was
a
cabinet
devoted
to
the
collection
a
small
chamber
filled
with
numerous
portfolios
and
carefully
arranged
as
to
schools
It
was
my
father
s
principal
pleasure
to
look
through
his
plates
rearranging
them
weeding
out
mediocre
specimens
while
vaunting
to
me
the
beauties
of
a
Goltzius
an
Edelinck
or
Drevet
a
J
R
Smith
copperplate
a
Sharpe
or
a
WooIIett
Stately
examples
of
the
French
and
English
schools
were
framed
and
were
literally
lived
with
No
especial
school
was
favoured
Lucas
Van
Leyden
and
Albrecht
Diirer
were
to
be
found
as
was
the
grey-haired
Man
or
the
large
Bervic
plate
of
Louis
XVI
Landscapes
after
Claude
fruit
and
flower
pieces
by
Huysums
were
there
Better
training
for
the
student
s
eye
I
don
t
know
than
a
col
lection
of
black
and
white
The
emotional
glamour
of
colour
is
absent
though
its
symbols
are
suggested
the
very
skeleton
of
composition
is
bared
and
the
art
of
design
abstract
and
concrete
may
be
learned
What
long
happy
summer
afternoons
we
spent
my
father
and
I
as
remote
from
the
actual
as
if
we
had
been
in
the
moon
At
least
once
a
week
old
man
Bonfield
as
he
was
familiarly
called
would
drop
in
and
salute
us
in
his
bluff
English
manner
Bonfield
was
a
marine
painter
of
excellent
talent
and
training
He
patterned
after
the
Dutch
marine
painters
Vandervelde
in
particular
He
loved
Constable
and
Turner
He
could
render
with
a
broad
flowing
brush
the
rhythms
of
water
and
clouds
He
helped
to
form
my
father
s
taste
in
engraving
Kep
pel
was
another
He
carried
prints
from
New
York
to
his
various
clients
in
Philadelphia
About
1850
mezzo
tints
and
steel
plates
were
easier
to
buy
than
now
also
etchings
for
then
there
was
no
craze
over
signed
exam
pies
That
phase
evolved
later
The
consequence
was
that
at
what
would
be
ridiculous
prices
to-day
my
father
acquired
all
sorts
of
plates
brilliant
bad
and
indifferent
As
his
knowledge
increased
he
became
wary
and
would
ac
cept
only
proofs
before-all-Ietters
His
etchings
were
his
pride
Rembrandt
largely
figured
but
not
Whistler
for
the
good
reason
that
he
was
not
then
an
etcher
I
doubt
if
he
ever
appreciated
the
subtle
needle
of
James
the
Butterfly
although
he
had
acquired
some
splendid
plates
of
Whistler
s
brother-in-law
then
known
as
Dr
Seymour
Haden
When
this
accomplished
craftsman
visited
Philadelphia
and
lectured
in
the
small
hall
of
the
Academy
of
the
Fine
Arts
I
attended
the
affair
and
re
member
the
florid
complexion
of
the
artist
rather
than
his
words
of
wisdom
This
was
about
the
time
that
Fortuny
s
Gamblers
was
shown
at
the
Union
League
Club
and
its
price
seventeen
thousand
dollars
was
mentioned
with
awe
Henry
C
Gibson
was
buying
Cabanel
and
Bouguereau
then
and
I
don
t
suppose
he
had
eyes
for
the
superior
art
of
the
great
Spaniard
Luckily
the
Academy
owns
one
sterling
picture
View
in
a
Spanish
City
Sevilla
A
few
years
afterwards
I
saw
the
Fortunys
of
the
Stewart
collection
at
Paris
especially
the
almost
miraculous
Choice
of
a
Model
which
in
this
decadent
epoch
of
muddy
colour
lumpy
modelling
and
freakish
design
would
be
patronised
by
myopic
youth
I
have
paid
a
tiny
tribute
to
his
genius
in
Promenades
of
an
Impres
sionist
The
Gamblers
to
be
truthful
didn
t
make
as
much
of
an
impression
on
me
at
that
time
as
Benjamin
West
s
apocalyptic
Death
on
the
Pale
Horse
still
hung
in
the
Academy
I
realise
now
the
overwhelming
su
periority
of
John
Martin
in
the
matter
of
invention
when
compared
with
the
more
successful
Quaker
medi
ocrity
Those
summer
afternoons
spent
with
our
collection
set
my
mind
wandering
on
a
dozen
different
roads
It
was
the
hub
of
the
wheel
of
which
the
spokes
were
arch
aeology
architecture
history
foreign
languages
music
and
what-not
all
growing
out
of
the
numerous
subjects
dealt
with
by
the
artists
I
verily
believe
my
first
longing
for
foreign
lands
and
travel
was
born
among
these
etched
and
engraved
plates
The
Centennial
Ex
position
of
1876
completed
the
victory
over
my
inborn
timidity
and
aversion
from
strangers
The
wheel
came
full
circle
in
1878
when
I
ran
away
with
my
parents
connivance
to
Paris
But
I
mustn
t
forget
that
other
collection
of
prints
around
the
corner
on
Logan
Square
the
truly
imposing
gallery
of
James
L
Claghorn
Sunday
afternoon
was
the
chosen
time
for
the
gathering
of
the
clans
Then
Mr
Claghorn
was
in
his
glory
An
enormous
man
with
abundant
white
hair
a
smooth-shaven
face
ecclesiastical
in
its
mixture
of
benignity
and
shrewdness
large
blue
eyes
and
a
cordial
manner
made
the
personality
of
this
con
noisseur
an
agreeable
one
To
me
a
slender
half-scared
boy
he
was
very
cordial
I
helped
to
shift
portfolios
lift
out
prints
for
his
inspection
and
doing
this
for
some
years
I
gained
more
than
a
glimpse
of
this
magnificent
collection
which
when
compared
to
our
modest
portfo
lios
was
as
the
sun
is
to
a
star
of
the
tenth
magnitude
AH
the
world
worth
knowing
in
Philadelphia
passed
through
the
Claghorn
galleries
and
also
many
foreign
celebrities
James
Claghorn
was
that
rare
and
rapidly
vanishing
specimen
of
humanity
a
merchant-prince
The
collection
was
sold
after
his
death
to
Mr
Garrett
of
Bal
timore
and
is
now
housed
at
Princeton
College
Our
plates
when
sold
did
not
fetch
a
big
price
owing
to
va
rious
reasons
My
father
s
ventures
in
oil
pictures
were
confined
entirely
to
the
American
school
Philadelphians
preferred

a

Teniers
which
I
own
and
a
dozen
other
paintings
by
men
of
minor
talent
all
testified
to
my
parent
s
faith
in
native
talent
Some
of
the
artists
were
constant
visitors
Peter
F
Rothermel
well
known
for
his
Battle
of
Gettys
burg
the
elder
Waugh
W
T
Richards
Hamilton
the
marine
painter
William
Hewitt
Bonfield
and
Isaac
Williams
Peter
Moran
John
Sartain
Dr
W
P
Baker
these
with
William
Dougherty
of
Girard
Avenue
a
col
lector
of
prints
and
a
man
of
taste
usually
figured
at
our
Sunday-night
gatherings
Thomas
Sully
the
portrait
painter
was
a
rarer
caller
Hewitt
was
a
born
mimic
and
I
can
still
hear
him
with
my
father
sing
an
old
song
Paul
and
Silas
Went
to
Jail
It
sounded
like
a
travesty
of
a
darky
camp-meeting
spiritual
Rothermel
tall
and
drily
sarcastic
seldom
opened
his
thin
lips
Isaac
Williams
was
like
Hokusai
an
old
man
mad-about
painting
He
was
the
theoriser
of
the
group
He
had
a
technical
treatment
ready
for
every
pictorial
subject
but
it
wasn
t
original
Reynolds
for
children
Gainsbor
ough
for
young
women
for
male
heads
Rembrandt
for
sacred
subjects
Raphael
or
Correggio
don
t
smile
Those
were
the
days
of
Raphael
worship
of
Correggio
idolatry
Velasquez
was
unknown
as
was
Vermeer
but
Murillo
and
Ostade
Ah
What
marvellous
artists
The
pre-Raphaelitic
group
was
not
known
and
the
school
of
Realism
was
abhorred
Sully
Peale
and
Gilbert
Stuart
most
admired
The
growing
vogue
of
Bouguereau
Cab
anel
Lefebvre
was
deplored
too
much
nudity
for
the
prudish
public
but
Gerome
was
applauded
to
the
skies
Gerome
and
Meissonier
The
Duel
in
the
Snow
litho
graphed
by
Gerome
after
his
own
design
was
popular
And
there
was
a
rumour
from
Parisian
ateliers
that
two
portraitists
Carolus
Duran
and
Leon
Bonnat
were
con
sidered
promising
It
all
sounds
before
the
deluge
doesn
t
it
Yet
I
have
heard
fierce
discussions
over
chiaro
scuro
as
it
was
called
then
over
the
disposition
of
the
model
usually
a
studio
mannikin
over
complementary
colours
over
the
arrangement
of
a
palette
yes
the
very
problems
that
were
agitating
a
certain
small
circle
in
Paris
the
Impressionists
Manet
who
was
not
strictly
speaking
one
of
the
group
though
in
the
revolt
against
the
Institute
Monet
Pissarro
Sisley
and
the
rest
In
influence
of
the
Emperor
Napoleon
III
That
was
about
the
period
when
the
new
and
heretical
theories
had
been
wafted
across
to
the
United
States
Not
one
of
the
art
ists
I
mention
had
a
good
word
for
the
innovators
but
they
discussed
them
not
by
name
but
their
theories
and
you
don
t
discuss
a
corpse
Impressionism
is
no
new
thing
Nevertheless
the
Philadelphia
artists
based
their
theories
on
a
sound
foundation
what
they
didn
t
see
was
that
tradition
often
proves
a
traitor
when
you
don
t
play
off
your
own
bat
For
them
the
fact
that
Rem
brandt
handled
lights
and
shadows
in
a
masterful
way
meant
complete
surrender
to
his
personal
methods
Any
deviation
spelled
anarchy
I
was
allowed
to
stay
up
a
little
later
than
custom
ary
on
Sunday
nights
As
vividly
as
this
morning
I
remember
sitting
on
William
Hewitt
s
knee
and
after
he
had
crooned
some
quaint
tune
the
conversation
touched
on
lighthouses
of
all
subjects
in
the
world
Finally
the
Eddystone
light
was
reached
What
was
the
secret
of
its
resistance
to
the
sea
and
storms
after
several
failures
in
building
no
one
knew
Full
of
the
subject
for
I
had
been
reading
the
history
of
Plymouth
I
boldly
spoke
up
I
know
My
father
looked
at
me
as
if
at
a
crazy
person
You
know
How
do
you
know
he
asked
Let
the
boy
alone
said
Bill
Hewitt
How
do
you
come
to
know
Jim
about
the
Eddystone
lighthouse
I
needed
no
further
encour
agement
I
know
because
John
Smeaton
dovetailed
the
stones
when
he
rebuilt
it
A
roar
of
approbation
greeted
this
tour-de-force
of
memory
I
wasn
t
more
than
seven
and
my
father
s
eyes
twinkled
He
was
evidently
proud
and
pleased
Polonius-Iike
he
remarked
Dovetailed
is
good
The
word
enchanted
me
I
repeated
it
for
days
dovetailed
dovetailed
I
was
as
bad
as
Flaubert
with
his
infernal
Taprabona
or
as
the
old
woman
with
her
blessed
word
Mesopotamia
I
can
t
hear
dovetailed
pronounced
to-day
without
seeing
the
smoke-filled
room
its
walls
plastered
with
engravings
the
cheery
voices
of
old
friends
my
father
s
kindly
bearded
ruddy
face
Dovetailed
dovetailed
Even
at
that
early
age
I
was
spouting
words
of
whose
meanings
I
was
often
ignorant
And
how
many
did
I
not
mispronounce
I
loved
yEsop
s
Fables
and
once
I
quoted
to
my
sister
The
mountains
that
were
in
labour
but
I
pronounced
the
last
word
with
the
accent
on
the
last
syllable
and
was
rewarded
with
shrieks
of
laughter
I
had
fancied
that
labour
like
Labrador
was
a
land
somewhere
in
the
Arctic
Zone
That
the
phrase
indicated
the
birth
of
a
mouse
did
not
seem
so
interesting
nor
exotic
MY
MOTHER
Tell
me
of
your
mother
and
I
ll
tell
you
of
yourself
As
a
man
speaks
of
his
mother
so
you
may
estimate
his
character
Arthur
Schopenhauer
was
right
when
he
said
that
from
his
father
a
man
derived
his
will
but
from
his
mother
he
inherited
his
intellect
The
exception
proves
the
case
and
while
we
have
traversed
many
psychological
leagues
since
Schopenhauer
in
the
main
we
adhere
to
his
theory
He
only
wrote
of
genius
but
his
idea
holds
good
for
the
average
man
and
woman
The
few
wits
I
possess
came
to
me
from
my
mother
who
was
a
woman
of
brains
above
all
of
character
Before
twenty
she
was
the
principal
of
a
high
school
somewhere
in
Kensington
She
saw
men
shot
in
the
streets
during
the
Know-Nothing
riots
of
1844
and
also
the
burning
of
St
Augustine
s
Church
on
Fourth
Street
She
always
had
the
faith
but
these
outrages
on
the
Irish
and
on
her
religion
crystallised
this
faith
She
was
not
a
theologian
in
petticoats
a
more
detestable
thing
than
a
female
politician
nor
was
she
a
propagandist
like
her
father
James
Gibbons
But
she
was
consistently
pious
and
a
practical
churchwoman
Her
erudition
was
notable
In
matters
of
theology
I
never
met
her
superior
among
her
sex
I
was
inducted
into
the
noble
literature
of
Bossuet
and
Pere
Lacordaire
early
in
my
teens
The
Paroles
d
un
Croyant
of
the
unhappy
Abbe
Lamennais
I
was
not
permitted
to
read
at
such
a
tender
age
though
my
mother
spoke
of
him
in
pitying
terms
Revolt
against
Rome
meant
to
her
revolt
against
life
Yet
she
was
not
a
bigot
She
did
not
condemn
to
the
ever
lasting
bonfire
dissenters
from
her
faith
My
Aunt
Susan
Gibbons
a
character
who
would
have
intrigued
Dickens
made
up
for
my
mother
s
tolerance
He
will
roast
in
hell
after
death
and
the
devil
will
baste
his
ribs
she
would
exclaim
to
the
intense
delight
of
the
children
She
not
only
put
the
enemies
of
Mother
Church
into
the
darkest
and
deepest
circles
of
the
fiery
pit
but
also
the
objects
of
her
personal
animosity
Like
her
father
she
loved
politics
A
Democrat
had
a
chance
for
heaven
no
matter
his
habits
a
Republican
however
was
doomed
No
appeal
Irrevocable
And
then
the
dear
irritable
spinster
would
go
into
the
kitchen
where
she
was
fervently
hated
by
our
two
Irish
girls
as
an
in
terloper
and
a
spoil-sport
and
fry
oysters
as
appetising
as
Finelli
s
fabricate
a
chicken-salad
which
reached
our
very
youthful
souls
and
Oh
she
baked
biscuits
which
melted
on
the
tongue
What
matters
a
woman
s
the
ology
if
she
cooks
like
an
angel
Aunt
Sue
did
thus
cook
but
she
paddled
us
like
a
devil
She
made
herself
our
mother
ex-officio
She
was
not
without
a
touch
of
spinster
acidity
and
her
occasional
cruelties
were
Celtic
She
had
native
humour
Celtic
also
the
voicing
of
her
sentiments
concerning
Republicans
Protestants
and
people
who
didn
t
subscribe
to
the
tenets
of
Fenianism
She
was
a
family
institution
this
aunt
of
ours
and
when
a
nurse
was
demanded
who
could
nurse
the
sick
with
such
tenderness
But
when
you
were
safely
launched
on
the
route
of
convalescence
she
put
off
all
such
weak
nesses
as
affection
or
solicitude
for
your
well-being
and
became
her
old
self
witty
sharp
of
tongue
and
the
im
placable
antagonist
of
anyone
who
dared
to
combat
her
prejudices
Forty
years
she
sparred
at
the
table
with
her
brother-in-law
my
father
and
as
her
tongue
was
more
nimble
her
wit
more
agile
her
vocabulary
larger
she
generally
got
the
best
of
him
It
was
all
in
a
vein
of
good
temper
yet
the
sparks
flew
especially
if
the
old
man
ventured
on
any
allusion
to
the
clergy
s
love
of
even
cheer
Then
Aunt
Sue
would
bristle
According
to
her
all
priests
were
ascetic
Like
Father
McBIank
would
interrupt
my
father
alluding
to
a
concrete
case
a
fat
jolly
priest
with
a
healthy
appetite
and
thirst
God
bless
his
memory
What
fulminations
ensued
John
Huneker
the
Old
One
will
surely
get
your
car
cass
My
father
would
hum
Lillibulero
and
the
incident
was
closed
But
as
a
teacher
of
the
young
she
had
few
rivals
Like
my
mother
she
began
as
a
public
school
teacher
and
while
her
intelligence
was
as
acute
as
her
sister
s
she
had
not
the
emotional
depth
nor
the
stability
of
character
nevertheless
she
had
the
art
of
imparting
knowledge
and
many
girls
now
matrons
in
this
city
will
recall
her
school
on
Spruce
Street
where
she
leased
a
floor
in
the
house
of
the
late
Dr
Brinton
A
mother
s
influence
should
be
like
gentle
rain
on
the
sandy
soil
of
youthful
egotism
a
boy
at
twelve
has
portioned
out
the
globe
in
his
fancy
Life
is
before
him
and
it
is
created
for
his
pleasure
alone
Anyone
who
comes
between
him
and
his
nascent
desires
is
a
rash
intruder
Why
can
t
we
accept
the
wisdom
of
our
elders
judgment
when
we
are
cautioned
not
to
fly
from
the
nest
before
our
wings
are
full-fledged
The
answer
is
to
be
seen
in
the
actions
of
any
girl
or
boy
with
a
par
ticle
of
self-assertion
and
as
a
rule
young
America
has
more
than
its
share
Because
each
soul
must
traverse
the
dolorous
path
of
experience
for
itself
There
is
life
knocking
at
the
doors
of
our
senses
bidding
us
come
out
and
enjoy
its
multifarious
pleasures
Always
pleasure
never
pain
it
matters
little
if
our
mother
bids
us
beware
She
knows
the
bitterness
of
the
dregs
She
recognises
the
illusions
And
yet
we
fly
in
the
face
of
her
admoni
tions
If
we
didn
t
we
shouldn
t
live
My
mother
who
had
sounded
the
heights
and
depths
knew
that
children
provisionally
accept
advice
She
had
mastered
the
art
of
holding
on
and
letting
go
which
is
the
secret
of
wisdom
So
I
had
a
pretty
long
rope
to
hang
on
I
can
t
recall
a
single
instance
of
a
blow
from
my
father
He
would
fume
mildly
speak
harsh
things
when
I
played
truant
but
in
five
minutes
the
sea
would
be
serenely
smooth
besides
I
took
advantage
of
his
weakness
Boys
are
almost
as
cunning
as
girls
in
this
respect
My
sister
Mary
had
only
to
play
the
theme
of
the
A
flat
Sonata
of
Beethoven
opus
26
and
she
could
wheedle
anything
from
my
male
parent
I
took
a
lesson
from
her
book
I
discoursed
of
Raphael
Morghen
and
his
engraved
Ma
donna
or
of
the
joyous
landscapes
of
Claude
Lorraine
All
was
forgiven
But
my
mother
was
never
trapped
by
such
obvious
subterfuges
Her
perception
of
right
and
wrong
had
the
incisive
clarity
of
an
etching
by
Meryon
Her
conscience
safest
of
monitors
in
her
case
would
not
allow
her
to
juggle
with
the
moralities
She
earnestly
wished
that
I
should
enter
the
clerical
life
Early
she
realised
the
hopelessness
of
her
wish
I
hadn
t
the
vocation
Nor
did
the
well-meant
promptings
of
some
of
the
sisters
at
Broad
and
Columbia
Avenue
deter
her
from
seeing
the
cold
truth
This
old
convent
was
my
delight
on
Sunday
afternoons
There
I
was
petted
by
Mother
Frances
de
Sales
and
Mother
Augustine
and
I
always
promised
like
the
meek
little
humbug
I
was
to
become
a
priest
when
I
grew
up
This
valiant
declaration
was
rewarded
with
candy
I
liked
candy
then
I
also
liked
to
play
in
the
nuns
garden
The
Sisters
of
Mercy
is
an
order
whose
rule
appealed
to
me
as
did
the
Jesuit
s
I
have
a
weakness
for
the
Jesuit
order
not
because
it
is
worldly
that
venerable
delusion
but
because
its
members
are
masters
of
the
gentle
arts
and
whatever
else
they
may
be
they
are
liberal
in
spirit
The
Sisters
of
Mercy
are
among
other
things
a
teaching
order
They
know
the
souls
of
their
pupils
Now
I
am
what
an
old
and
very
dear
priest
calls
a
hickory
Catholic
yet
I
love
the
odour
of
incense
the
mystic
bells
the
music
the
atmos
phere
of
the
altar
above
all
the
intellectual
life
of
the
church
There
is
a
world
of
thought
suspended
like
Mahomet
s
coffin
above
the
quotidian
existence
of
re
ligion
It
is
not
free
to
everyone
nor
is
it
an
arcanum
forbidden
all
but
the
few
Its
literature
had
penetrated
my
very
bones
when
boys
of
my
age
were
playing
mar
bles
No
wonder
some
of
our
ecclesiastical
friends
saw
in
me
the
making
of
a
fervidly
pious
young
priest
But
some
did
not
Father
Boudreaux
a
French
priest
and
author
did
not
nor
did
the
Reverend
Dr
Kent
Stone
a
convert
noted
for
his
unction
and
oratory
He
saw
a
row
of
books
on
my
table
and
shook
his
head
He
had
his
misgivings
when
he
noted
the
four
volumes
of
Charles
Baudelaire
the
critic
Baudelaire
and
there
are
few
to
surpass
him
in
clairvoyance
interested
me
as
much
as
the
poet
the
essays
of
Walter
Pater
Matthew
Arnold
the
poems
of
Swinburne
Rossetti
of
Poe
and
Gautier
Rabelais
Montaigne
Goethe
Aquinas
and
Emerson
had
their
place
and
Schopenhauer
and
there
were
sermons
by
Lacordaire
whose
harmonious
French
I
savoured
and
Bourdaloue
Madame
de
Swetchine
and
Eugenie
de
Guerin
were
there
I
read
the
sister
before
I
saw
the
pantheistic
prose-poem
of
her
brother
Maurice
The
Centaur
This
poet
whose
sensibility
was
as
exquisite
as
Chopin
s
I
still
love
But
he
didn
t
die
a
moment
too
soon
for
his
artistic
reputation
My
chief
offence
how
ever
was
Walt
Whitman
the
1867
edition
of
his
Poems
Professor
George
Saintsbury
had
introduced
me
to
the
genius
of
Baudelaire
who
waxes
in
greatness
with
the
waning
of
the
years
and
Professor
Edward
Dowden
of
Dublin
sent
me
in
eager
haste
to
modern
French
litera
ture
that
is
modern
in
1875
or
thereabouts
I
had
in
troduced
myself
to
Whitman
by
securing
his
volumes
and
later
1877
by
visiting
the
Bard
of
Camden
in
his
lair
on
Mickle
Street
But
I
had
seen
him
for
years
on
Mar
ket
or
Chestnut
Streets
a
Homeric
man
good
to
gaze
upon
with
his
magnificent
head
and
bare
chest
I
never
saw
him
without
a
forlorn
pup
at
his
heels
But
I
have
told
you
all
this
in
Ivory
Apes
and
Peacocks
He
is
one
of
the
peacocks
Dr
Stone
knew
that
a
youth
who
poisoned
himself
with
such
powerful
and
pernicious
toxics
as
Baudelaire
and
Whitman
had
no
inner
call
to
religion
though
its
ritual
appealed
to
his
aesthetic
sense
I
read
all
day
when
I
had
a
chance
read
everything
from
editorials
in
the
Public
Ledger
which
seemed
to
me
masterpieces
of
common-sense
to
Dante
and
Shakespeare
The
Divine
Comedy
had
just
appeared
with
the
fantastic
illustrations
of
Gustave
Dore
The
poem
and
pictures
gripped
us
and
I
see
myself
playing
Lucifer
to
my
brother
Paul
s
Minotaur
in
our
back
yard
Every
circle
in
the
Inferno
we
tried
to
imitate
Many
rows
with
my
old
nurse
Maish
Finn
ensued
To-day
the
terza
rima
of
that
sombre
and
magnificent
poet
is
as
alluring
as
ever
Pos
sibly
Dore
and
his
vivid
fancy
first
attracted
us
Don
Quixote
was
another
magnet
And
Bunyan
with
his
glorious
apotheosis
of
the
soul
which
we
accepted
as
sheer
facts
thanks
to
his
sober
convincing
prose
be
came
a
masque
of
boyhood
But
the
dream
of
a
sacer
dotal
dedication
was
further
away
than
ever
My
mother
once
remarked
What
can
you
expect
in
the
future
if
you
turn
your
mind
into
a
sewer
for
all
these
vile
poets
and
infidels
She
didn
t
know
that
Baudelaire
is
the
Catholic
poet
par
excellence
one
whose
morose
delecta
tion
would
have
been
congenial
to
John
of
the
Cross
Ruysbroeck
or
any
early
mystic
Contempt
for
life
is
in
his
words
hatred
of
self
fiercer
hatred
for
woman
a
hatred
so
cuttingly
expressed
by
the
monk
St
Odo
of
Cluny
quomodo
ipsum
steroris
saccum
amplecti
de
sideramus
truly
a
judgment
on
feminine
beauty
in
the
manner
of
the
early
Church
Fathers
I
quote
this
from
Affirmations
by
that
philosophic
and
erudite
critic
Havelock
Ellis
a
writer
after
my
own
heart
Or
Arthur
Schopenhauer
with
his
convincing
pronouncements
of
the
nothingness
of
life
Isn
t
he
in
consonance
with
the
wisdom
of
the
church
Not
the
pellucid
style
and
charm
of
Cardinal
Newman
could
offset
the
deadly
lessons
in
pessimism
of
the
poet
and
philosopher
Walt
Whitman
and
his
Bowery
Boy
Emersonism
his
anarchic
defiance
of
the
ordinary
decencies
of
life
completed
the
disruption
of
my
character
Hereafter
these
were
the
dissonances
in
my
little
harmonic
scale
The
spiritual
dichotomy
was
complete
My
mother
was
right
and
yet
and
yet
life
is
to
be
faced
not
feared
Prove
all
things
said
the
Apostle
I
might
have
made
a
short
cut
to
salvation
if
I
had
listened
to
my
mother
But
I
didn
t
I
was
wrong
And
if
I
had
to
go
through
it
all
again
I
should
proceed
approximately
the
same
Cowardice
is
a
more
fatal
spiritual
lesion
than
vainglorious
rashness
For
each
man
must
weave
the
web
of
his
own
destiny
There
is
a
time
to
be
static
and
there
is
a
time
to
be
dynamic
The
trouble
was
that
I
too
often
played
the
dynamic
at
the
wrong
time
What
I
most
wonder
at
and
also
ad
mire
is
the
tolerant
spirit
exhibited
by
my
mother
She
protested
but
she
allowed
me
my
intellectual
freedom
Once
I
saw
her
genuinely
indignant
She
caught
me
on
the
roof
reading
Strathmore
by
Ouida
a
novelist
she
detested
Like
Max
Beerbohm
I
had
conceived
a
pas
sion
for
this
extravagantly
romantic
writer
Not
even
Guy
Livingstone
from
whom
Ouida
derived
cured
me
of
her
sentimental
sensuality
Dickens
did
and
when
I
reached
in
due
course
of
time
Thackeray
the
Ouida
measles
had
quite
disappeared
But
the
school
was
looming
up
school
and
its
odious
tasks
its
discipline
its
convict-like
confinement
It
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
I
should
be
sent
to
a
sectarian
establishment
though
not
to
the
parish
school
I
had
been
taught
my
catechism
by
the
good
nuns
and
also
at
our
parish
church
St
Malachi
s
on
Eleventh
Street
near
Jefferson
Gaunt
Father
Kelly
had
scared
us
with
his
harsh
manner
and
I
soon
feared
him
It
was
an
adventure
too
the
trip
from
Seventh
Street
Gangs
of
rival
boys
laid
in
wait
for
us
and
many
times
I
ran
homeward
dodging
stones
and
brickbats
The
old
lawlessness
of
the
fire
companies
had
been
abolished
but
not
altogether
The
South
Penn
Hose
Company
fought
the
Cohocksink
Hose
at
every
fire
I
saw
a
building
burn
down
on
Marshal
Street
one
bitter
cold
morning
while
red-shirted
heroes
in
the
old
style
fire
man
s
hat
beat
each
other
with
spanners
hose-pipes
and
fists
It
was
magnificent
but
it
wasn
t
fair
to
the
house
holders
Like
their
elders
the
young
toughs
who
played
in
the
Ninth
Street
lots
descended
a
horde
of
savages
on
the
more
civilised
purlieus
of
Franklin
or
Seventh
Streets
Baste
the
dudes
bang
the
squirts
were
passwords
Any
boy
who
wore
a
clean
collar
was
considered
effeminate
nor
did
the
girls
escape
The
cotton-dollies
wearing
sunbonnets
from
up
Kensington
way
would
assault
any
girl
with
pretty
ribbons
or
hair
carefully
combed
On
election
nights
the
guerilla
war
fare
was
terrifying
Bands
of
young
ruffians
some
of
them
I
know
to-day
as
distinguished
lights
on
the
Bench
at
the
Bar
also
in
the
Eastern
Penitentiary
swept
down
on
our
bonfires
ruthlessly
stamping
them
out
worse
actually
stealing
the
flaming
barrels
so
sedulously
stolen
by
our
gang
earlier
in
the
week
and
then
dumping
them
in
a
cage
which
they
dragged
over
the
cobble-stones
with
yells
of
triumph
One
November
evening
my
father
tried
conclusions
with
them
They
escaped
his
slipper
his
only
weapon
of
offence
and
he
limped
back
quite
forgetful
of
one
foot
in
a
stocking
These
affairs
deeply
impressed
me
I
was
a
physical
coward
and
dodged
a
fight
whenever
I
could
But
one
afternoon
I
was
cornered
Then
the
scared
boy
became
desperate
For
weeks
that
conflict
was
the
subject
of
gossip
and
curious
comment
I
put
a
bully
down
and
out
but
there
was
much
critical
asperity
over
my
methods
I
was
said
to
have
fought
unfairly
Why
Simply
because
I
trans
formed
my
left
arm
into
a
revolving
flail
if
such
a
thing
could
be
and
knocked
the
other
chap
senseless
I
won
t
say
that
admiration
was
withheld
but
it
was
quali
fied
You
hadn
t
ought
to
done
it
was
the
final
judgment
of
a
veteran
pugilist
of
ten
And
I
shouldn
t
but
I
won
Later
on
Chancellor
Street
down-town
in
my
famous
fight
to
a
finish
with
bare
knuckles
with
Jimmy
Kelly
my
old
tactics
availed
me
naught
I
had
both
eyes
blackened
swollen
lips
one
tooth
loosened
and
an
ear
magnified
to
the
size
and
colour
of
a
ripe
tomato
After
that
downfall
I
abandoned
all
hopes
of
the
prize-ring
Another
time
I
was
rescued
by
my
elder
brother
at
the
corner
of
Eighth
and
Jefferson
Streets
Vacant
lots
A
covey
of
vicious
lads
The
gas-house
gang
I
only
played
the
witness
incidentally
dodging
flying
missiles
But
the
enemy
didn
t
count
opposed
to
the
skill
strength
and
courage
of
my
brother
He
sailed
into
them
like
an
armoured
cruiser
battered
down
their
defence
and
finally
chased
them
from
the
field
That
night
a
parlour
window
was
broken
by
a
half
brick
They
never
for
gave
us
I
quit
the
dangerous
route
except
on
Sun
days
when
protected
by
my
parents
I
had
been
con
firmed
at
St
Malachi
s
by
Bishop
Wood
afterwards
Archbishop
as
I
had
been
dedicated
at
St
Michael
s
by
Bishop
Gibbons
later
Cardinal
James
Gibbons
I
was
taken
by
my
mother
into
the
Sacristy
of
St
Michael
s
and
kissed
the
hand
of
that
distinguished
churchman
Furthermore
I
had
been
given
in
confirmation
the
name
of
St
Aloysius
of
Gonzaga
the
patron
saint
of
purity
That
was
handing
over
a
hostage
to
fortune
The
devil
must
have
smiled
when
the
news
reached
his
apartment
in
the
infernal
tropics
He
was
at
my
elbow
in
twenty
four
hours
and
has
never
left
it
since
At
three
score
and
ten
I
hope
to
rid
myself
of
this
particular
pest
but
not
till
then
Ah
the
braggart
I
hear
him
whisper
After
my
first
communion
at
the
convent
this
diabolic
familiar
came
in
conflict
with
my
guardian
angel
I
fought
with
my
junior
brother
over
a
silver
watch
and
we
punched
and
cursed
till
separated
No
denying
the
existence
of
demons
Again
my
mother
shook
her
head
My
worldly
vocation
was
undeniable
I
GO
TO
SCHOOL
The
school
selected
for
me
was
Roth
s
Military
Acad
emy
at
No
337
South
Broad
Street
The
building
still
stands
the
facade
unchanged
From
Seventh
and
Jeffer
son
Streets
to
it
was
a
long
distance
It
seemed
unend
ing
I
took
the
walk
every
day
in
fair
weather
usually
in
company
with
my
brother
and
sister
We
were
in
timate
with
several
Jewish
families
the
Aubs
the
Eisners
the
Bacharachs
be
still
my
heart
one
beautiful
maid
Bertha
by
name
with
Oriental
eyes
and
tresses
won
my
admiration
and
the
chattering
crowd
would
go
down
Franklin
Street
to
our
various
schools
I
don
t
know
whether
customs
have
changed
but
many
of
my
sister
s
school
companions
were
of
Jewish
origin
Roman
Catholics
and
Jews
got
along
very
well
as
any
Catholic
convent
list
then
proved
One
morning
we
were
alone
my
sister
and
I
and
at
the
corner
of
Eighth
and
Poplar
Streets
were
suddenly
attacked
by
a
lot
of
boys
who
cried
Jew
Jew
where
s
your
pork
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
been
called
a
Jew
but
not
the
last
Being
liberal
in
our
notions
we
did
not
feel
insulted
until
the
fighting
blood
of
the
Gibbons
was
aroused
in
my
sister
I
was
too
puny
to
be
of
assistance
She
needed
none
Firmly
grasping
the
straps
of
her
leather
school-bag
she
whirled
it
about
as
if
it
were
a
Zulu
club
the
same
circular
tactics
that
won
my
first
battle
The
rout
was
unques
tionable
She
banged
those
boys
so
badly
that
there
after
we
were
never
molested
In
my
eyes
she
became
Boadicea
What
made
me
a
peculiar
victim
was
the
cadet
uniform
I
was
compelled
to
wear
A
torture
On
our
caps
were
the
letters
B
S
C
Broad
Street
Cadets
which
was
jeeringly
transposed
to
Broad
Street
Cleaners
by
the
hoodlums
Envy
said
my
mother
But
I
didn
t
think
so
It
was
the
hatred
of
any
boy
for
an
other
who
is
differently
dressed
That
uniform
what
unhappy
hours
it
gave
me
How
I
loathed
its
grey
and
black
its
buttons
its
cap
Professor
Roth
our
prin
cipal
ranked
the
soldier
only
one
step
below
the
priest
in
the
social
hierarchy
A
good
soldier
makes
a
good
citizen
he
declared
A
good
citizen
makes
a
good
hus
band
a
pious
churchman
Obedience
was
his
watch
word
and
then
the
health-giving
drill
the
physical
de
velopment
in
the
gymnasium
This
military
discipline
and
the
Latin
language
were
the
two
obsessions
of
the
worthy
man
for
obsessions
they
were
It
was
the
alphabet
and
Latin
arithmetic
and
Latin
grammar
and
Latin
geography
and
Latin
history
and
Latin
mathematics
and
Latin
the
arts
and
sciences
and
Latin
and
of
course
religion
and
Latin
Before
I
could
parse
an
English
sentence
I
had
Caesar
pumped
into
me
At
twelve
I
had
bolted
the
Latin
literature
and
to-day
I
can
t
read
Cicero
without
mental
nausea
though
Horace
is
always
at
my
elbow
Greek
literature
was
then
a
sealed
book
not
because
Mr
Roth
disliked
it
he
was
too
much
a
humanist
for
that
but
that
he
loved
Latin
the
more
The
consequence
is
that
I
know
little
Latin
and
less
Greek
But
the
solid
foundations
were
laid
and
aided
me
in
modern
literature
and
in
the
study
of
the
law
We
read
Greek
in
translation
from
Xenophon
s
Anabasis
to
the
decadent
writers
I
had
not
then
any
taste
for
Huysman
s
favourite
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
A
D
Latin
authors
St
Augustine
however
seemed
as
romantic
as
Rousseau
or
Amiel
But
English
Ah
That
was
the
weak
joint
in
the
Roth
educational
armour
the
three
R
s
I
mean
The
curriculum
was
the
ordinary
one
We
ploughed
through
it
in
a
matter-of-fact
way
I
m
weak
on
grammar
and
algebra
to-day
But
a
page
of
Livy
or
a
quotation
from
Plutarch
would
fire
the
en
thusiasm
of
our
chief
and
farewell
to
Prescott
or
differ
ential
calculus
French
came
next
in
the
favour
of
this
remarkable
Irishman
and
Jules
Verne
then
fresh
on
the
horizon
he
translated
for
our
benefit
It
was
like
a
rummage-bag
this
system
You
put
in
your
hand
and
at
hazard
drew
forth
anything
from
Aristotle
to
Plain
Chant
Choral
singing
was
a
rule
enforced
Leopold
Engelke
our
preceptor
He
was
an
excellent
violon
cellist
and
like
so
many
musicians
of
the
time
he
taught
singing
and
played
the
organ
We
sang
everything
more
or
less
in
tune
we
sang
the
Gloria
from
Mozart
s
reputed
Twelfth
Mass
and
we
sang
with
infinite
glee
a
rollicking
air
to
the
words
of
Johnny
Schmoker
Negro
minstrelsy
was
in
its
golden
prime
and
Carncross
and
Dixey
s
on
Eleventh
Street
furnished
us
with
a
repertory
of
nigger
melodies
Happy
days
Not
a
bit
of
it
I
hated
them
then
and
I
look
back
to
them
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
they
are
over
and
done
with
It
is
a
com
mon
error
among
grown-ups
to
fancy
that
childhood
is
the
happiest
period
of
our
lives
It
is
usually
the
most
miserable
Often
I
wished
that
my
childhood
could
be
abolished
I
envied
my
elders
envied
their
freedom
from
constructive
criticism
from
bullying
from
flogging
and
a
hundred
other
cruel
impediments
between
my
wishes
and
their
fulfilment
There
were
plenty
of
boys
who
thought
as
I
did
Tom
Sawyer
and
Huckleberry
Finn
are
delightful
fairy
books
for
the
old
who
wish
their
school-days
had
been
so
recklessly
vagrant
and
filled
with
impossible
adventures
I
was
like
boys
of
my
age
and
enjoyed
myself
out
of
school
but
study
killed
the
joy
of
living
Goethe
supposed
to
be
the
happiest
man
in
history
confessed
at
four
score
that
he
could
remember
only
four
weeks
of
positive
happiness
in
a
long
life
and
those
weeks
were
scattered
resolving
themselves
into
days
hours
or
mere
fractions
of
a
minute
Perhaps
if
the
truth
be
told
few
lucky
men
could
boast
even
four
weeks
I
can
recall
one
brief
blazing
second
of
absolute
happiness
when
I
actually
said
to
myself
I
am
happy
It
was
like
the
moments
of
ecstasy
that
are
said
to
presage
an
epileptic
seizure
when
the
arterial
tension
is
dangerously
high
and
approaches
a
cerebral
crisis
I
was
about
ten
or
twelve
It
was
at
the
corner
of
Seventh
and
Oxford
Streets
where
the
old
hay-market
stood
Hay
in
those
days
was
not
baled
and
sent
to
market
as
it
is
now
the
hay
wagon
was
in
its
glory
the
hay-wagon
with
its
driver
concealed
in
front
and
a
string
of
urchins
tagging
behind
You
may
see
this
hay-wagon
in
the
paintings
of
John
Con
stable
engraved
by
Lucas
The
day
was
an
early
spring
one
saturated
with
sunshine
the
air
eager
and
nipping
A
feeling
of
contentment
flooded
my
consciousness
A
hay-wagon
went
by
I
was
as
if
transfigured
I
mur
mured
I
am
happy
I
fancy
it
was
the
sensation
superinduced
by
a
perfect
balance
of
body
and
spirit
that
and
youth
The
Greeks
named
it
ataraxia
I
have
never
experienced
the
feeling
since
not
even
in
the
trans
ports
of
calf-love
Only
a
few
years
ago
as
I
looked
at
the
Walnut
Street
Theatre
a
hay-wagon
old-fashioned
as
ever
moved
up
Walnut
Street
and
turned
into
Ninth
Street
In
a
vivid
flash
a
bolt
from
the
blue
of
my
locked
memory-chambers
came
the
incident
I
relate
I
saw
the
old
hay-market
on
Oxford
Street
and
the
hay
wagons
felt
the
cutting
sunshine
but
I
didn
t
repeat
I
am
happy
That
seldom
comes
more
than
once
in
a
lifetime
and
to
be
quite
philosophical
over
the
matter
it
is
just
as
well
for
then
the
reactions
are
fewer
You
may
not
attain
paradise
nor
do
you
tumble
into
hell
I
can
conceive
of
no
more
awful
suffering
than
the
pro
longed
rapture
we
call
happiness
Human
nature
can
endure
misery
but
not
without
peril
to
its
immortal
soul
can
it
wallow
in
happiness
Some
cynic
has
observed
that
life
would
be
tolerable
were
it
not
for
its
pleasures
and
Lord
Brassey
traveller
and
yachtsman
after
a
long
life
of
enjoyment
has
told
us
that
he
positively
loathed
his
existence
because
of
its
happiness
My
school
companion
and
deskmate
was
Lewis
Baker
afterwards
on
the
stage
and
John
Drew
s
brother-in-law
His
father
was
Lewis
Baker
an
excellent
comedian
first
at
the
Arch
Street
Theatre
later
with
Daly
in
New
York
All
I
remember
of
Lewis
is
that
he
invariably
ate
my
luncheon
and
knowing
there
was
no
escaping
this
expropriation
I
begged
our
cook
to
give
me
double
ra
tions
which
she
did
she
always
spoiled
me
But
the
appetite
of
Lewis
at
once
became
more
ferocious
I
who
had
been
dubbed
hollow-legs
by
my
satirical
father
because
of
my
capacity
for
a
miscellaneous
cargo
of
food
was
silenced
by
Lewis
Baker
s
prowess
So
we
came
to
daily
blows
and
finally
Professor
Roth
conducted
us
to
the
death-cell
where
he
slapped
our
hands
with
a
heavy
ferule
Why
I
should
have
been
punished
I
couldn
t
discover
It
was
my
first
collision
with
the
inherent
injustice
of
all
things
mundane
And
I
revolted
On
general
principles
I
became
the
worst
behaved
boy
in
my
class
I
stopped
studying
I
played
hookey
I
defied
my
legal
guardians
I
was
agin
all
forms
of
government
It
was
only
one
of
those
little
tempera
mental
outbreaks
which
any
teacher
recognises
as
inevi
table
Mr
Roth
was
not
a
tactful
man
We
were
students
by
compulsion
He
took
little
account
of
in
dividual
variations
in
character
It
was
the
same
old
mould-theory
of
education
Dress
alike
walk
alike
think
alike
Nietzsche
has
defined
the
Prussian
as
long
legs
and
obedience
and
Roth
s
idea
of
a
boy
was
as
a
receptacle
for
the
Latin
language
and
a
capacity
for
re
peating
Amo
Amas
Amat
ad
nauseam
Automatons
well-drilled
but
incapable
any
one
of
us
of
forming
a
personal
opinion
beyond
hating
our
masters
I
re
spectfully
submit
that
this
is
the
wrong
way
Our
re
ceptive
brains
are
so
stuffed
with
indigestible
facts
that
only
lifelong
experience
frees
us
from
the
abominable
clogging
I
don
t
know
how
it
was
in
the
upper
classes
of
this
school
which
I
never
reached
thanks
to
my
inveterate
laziness
but
it
must
have
been
the
same
THE
PLAYERS
John
Drew
and
my
brother
John
were
classmates
and
their
friendship
continued
after
their
school-days
had
ended
They
joined
the
Malta
Boat
Club
and
often
rowed
double-sculls
on
the
Schuylkill
course
Young
Drew
was
already
on
the
boards
a
promising
beginner
I
saw
him
make
his
debut
in
Cool
as
a
Cucumber
at
the
old
Arch
Street
Theatre
then
under
the
management
of
his
mother
that
sterling
actress
and
admirable
woman
Mrs
John
Drew
Later
his
sister
Georgia
Drew
not
yet
married
to
brilliant
irresponsible
Maurice
Barry
more
also
made
her
first
bow
before
the
footlights
in
this
theatre
My
father
decorated
the
establishment
from
time
to
time
and
was
a
friend
of
Mrs
Drew
After
some
friendly
dispute
over
the
colours
I
heard
him
call
her
Mother
Drew
I
was
aghast
It
seemed
as
sacri
legious
as
calling
Sarah
Siddons
Mother
But
Mrs
Drew
only
laughed
and
shook
her
forefinger
at
my
father
Now
John
Huneker
she
cried
if
this
theatre
isn
t
decorated
on
time
then
I
ll
open
it
with
your
scaffolding
in
it
just
the
same
She
could
play
Lady
Gay
Spanker
Mrs
Malaprop
the
adventuress
in
Home
and
also
remain
a
shrewd
woman
of
business
She
was
my
first
Lady
Teazle
Mrs
Malaprop
and
Queen
Gertrude
in
Hamlet
and
I
worshipped
her
When
I
saw
her
for
the
last
time
on
the
stage
in
The
Rivals
with
Joseph
Jefferson
she
was
venerable
in
years
but
her
vivacity
made
the
audience
oblivious
to
her
age
She
was
a
fine
comedienne
and
her
gifted
grandchildren
Ethel
Lionel
and
John
Barrymore
owe
her
much
and
with
her
son
John
have
much
to
be
proud
of
their
lineage
My
chief
dissipation
was
this
same
Arch
Street
Theatre
The
stock
company
has
always
seemed
to
me
to
rank
in
com
pleteness
with
any
other
and
the
visiting
guests
were
distinguished
Another
of
my
passions
was
E
A
Sothern
the
father
of
E
H
Sothern
Lytton
and
Sam
Sothern
Lytton
is
dead
I
thought
him
more
talented
as
an
actor
than
his
brother
Edward
But
who
knows
I
was
very
young
and
impressionable
and
perhaps
my
intimacy
later
on
with
Lytton
may
have
influenced
my
judgment
He
was
a
handsome
winning
chap
But
one
thing
is
certain
none
of
the
three
sons
rivalled
their
father
in
art
or
per
sonality
Pathos
was
his
weak
point
and
he
knew
it
nevertheless
his
David
Garrick
mellowed
with
the
years
I
believe
his
Fitzaltamont
in
that
screaming
burlesque
The
Crushed
Tragedian
recorded
in
reverse
fashion
his
aspirations
He
had
wished
to
enact
tragedy
but
nature
forbade
him
There
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
an
intonation
in
his
voice
that
won
his
audience
from
the
moment
he
set
foot
on
the
boards
but
the
tragic
tem
perament
he
had
not
Yet
there
was
one
speech
a
soliloquy
in
The
Crushed
Tragedian
that
he
delivered
with
genuine
feeling
it
sets
forth
his
ambition
to
be
come
the
greatest
tragedian
that
ever
lived
It
always
gave
the
audience
pause
when
spoken
by
Mr
Sothern
a
respite
from
his
laughter-breeding
antics
The
piece
was
wretched
stuff
nor
was
Lord
Dundreary
much
better
Laura
Keene
gave
it
up
in
despair
So
did
John
Sleeper
Clarke
whose
Asa
Trenchard
was
capital
Our
American
Cousin
as
it
was
then
known
was
all
Sothern
Aut
Sothern
aut
nihil
His
English
swell
of
the
day
the
Ouida
and
Guy
Livingstone
period
was
a
finely
wrought
piece
of
art
Remember
too
that
the
elder
Sothern
s
Dundreary
was
far
from
being
an
imbecile
caricature
as
he
was
of
the
heavy
guardsman
type
He
had
a
keen
eye
for
his
personal
interests
witness
his
stuttering
speech
I
require
all
my
influence
for
my
own
family
Not
Richard
Mansfield
as
Beau
Brum
mel
exhibited
such
polished
art
as
Sothern
in
this
poor
play
although
it
was
no
worse
in
quality
than
Clyde
Fitch
s
travesty
When
Sothern
played
Dundreary
at
the
Walnut
Street
Theatre
it
was
with
a
different
cast
Linda
Dietz
from
the
Haymarket
London
was
the
Georgina
Mrs
Walcott
Bailey
Atkins
Lawrence
who
would
have
been
a
movie
idol
now
with
Charles
Walcot
as
Trenchard
and
Hemple
as
the
valet
not
so
competent
if
I
remember
aright
as
the
inimitable
Binney
of
W
H
Chapman
This
was
years
after
the
original
performance
of
the
piece
Amusing
as
he
was
in
Brother
Sam
with
a
blond
make-up
and
not
appearing
over
twenty-five
years
of
age
Mr
Sothern
was
more
in
his
element
as
David
Gar
rick
Only
Salvini
in
Sullivan
the
foreign
title
effaced
our
impression
of
his
drunken
scene
As
Sydney
Spoonbill
in
A
Hornet
s
Nest
by
Byron
this
English
comedian
was
vastly
entertaining
His
native
elegance
his
personal
charm
his
handsome
features
his
lightness
of
touch
recall
what
we
read
of
the
palmy
days
of
Charles
Mathews
He
was
the
best
English-speaking
comedian
I
ever
saw
except
Charles
Coghlan
and
Coghlan
was
not
so
lovable
as
Sothern
who
was
a
gentleman
on
and
off
the
boards
His
son
E
H
Sothern
inherited
more
than
a
modicum
of
his
father
s
deft
art
and
while
I
applaud
his
ambitious
efforts
as
a
Shakespeare
tragedian
I
think
the
American
theatre
lost
one
of
its
best
light
comedians
because
of
this
vaulting
ambition
We
remember
his
early
impersonations
at
the
old
Lyceum
on
Fourth
Avenue
New
York
when
he
was
supported
by
Virginia
Harned
and
in
The
Highest
Bidder
Possibly
his
high-water
mark
was
in
If
I
Were
King
His
Claude
Hamlet
and
Macbeth
were
not
convincing
but
his
Mal
volio
had
good
points
However
it
is
ungrateful
to
bear
down
too
heavily
on
the
temperamental
shortcomings
of
an
earnest
studious
actor
the
son
of
a
distinguished
sire
who
despite
his
physical
limitations
he
lacked
the
necessary
inches
for
tragedy
did
so
much
for
Shake
speare
in
this
country
in
conjunction
with
fascinating
Julia
Marlowe
Arthur
Symons
praised
the
pure
dic
tion
of
this
artistic
pair
when
they
played
in
London
The
crisp
too-staccato
speech
of
Sothern
was
counter
balanced
by
the
rich
organ-like
music
of
Miss
Marlowe
s
voice
Such
a
voice
I
have
not
heard
since
Adelaide
Neilson
s
Sothern
was
not
the
only
attraction
at
the
Arch
Street
Theatre
I
forgot
to
add
that
once
I
saw
him
play
opposite
to
Mrs
Drew
in
L
Aventuriere
Edwin
Booth
then
in
his
prime
was
a
visitor
there
I
hardly
lived
on
earth
after
his
Hamlet
and
lago
I
had
seen
Charles
Fechter
s
impersonation
blond
wig
Soho
accent
and
all
but
I
was
not
old
enough
to
mark
the
differences
in
the
two
readings
Fechter
had
seemed
to
me
superb
actor
that
he
was
to
be
a
robustious
periwigged
fellow
who
all
fat
and
fury
ranted
too
much
And
as
it
was
toward
the
close
of
an
exceptionally
brilliant
career
he
was
too
flabby
to
be
an
ideal
Prince
of
Denmark
He
was
then
married
to
Lizzie
Price
of
the
Arch
Street
Com
pany
and
lived
at
Doylestown
We
shuddered
at
the
ex
pression
of
malignity
of
his
Obenreizer
in
the
dramatised
version
of
No
Thoroughfare
His
Bertuccio
in
The
Fool
s
Revenge
must
have
been
played
in
the
same
sinister
key
I
never
saw
it
but
I
saw
Edwin
Booth
as
the
Jester
and
was
more
than
satisfied
Only
Victor
Maurel
in
Rigoletto
the
operatic
version
paralleled
Booth
in
the
part
as
he
did
later
as
lago
in
Verdi
s
Otello
The
Arch
Street
stock
was
excellent
Watching
it
for
years
from
the
family
circle
twenty-five
cents
I
became
familiar
with
a
wide
repertory
of
plays
restoration
comedy
the
classics
of
the
eighteenth
cen
tury
and
the
entire
range
of
mid
Victorian
pieces
Tom
Robertson
and
H
J
Byron
were
favourites
and
Caste
was
considered
a
test
for
any
theatrical
company
as
indeed
it
was
and
as
indeed
it
would
be
nowadays
Just
put
some
of
the
belauded
actors
who
are
drawing
full
houses
in
such
amusing
rubbish
as
Oh
Boy
Oh
Girl
Hello
Bill
Oh
Rot
into
the
parts
of
Old
Eccles
or
Sam
Gerridge
or
Polly
Eckles
and
you
would
see
the
muddle
they
would
make
of
these
contrasted
characters
I
ve
often
attended
performances
of
the
little
theatres
with
their
bandbox
art
and
wondered
over
the
rawness
of
the
acting
Want
of
stock
training
is
the
cause
Any
fly-by-night
company
in
my
youth
could
at
a
few
hours
notice
give
better
interpretations
of
not
only
Shakespeare
but
also
modern
comedy
than
these
young
men
and
women
who
make
a
dab
at
Nora
Helmer
agonise
over
Oswald
Alving
wriggle
through
Hedda
Gabler
but
can
t
speak
clearly
or
convincingly
or
for
that
matter
walk
across
the
stage
without
sex
consciousness
I
won
t
pretend
to
deny
that
Ibsen
isn
t
a
thousand
times
superior
to
Robertson
or
Byron
Pinero
Henry
Arthur
Jones
or
Shaw
but
their
now
conven
tionalised
drama
was
once
fresh
and
full
of
fat
for
the
actor
Studying
a
variety
of
roles
is
the
best
exercise
for
young
people
It
is
the
problem
ethical
or
otherwise
of
the
play
that
now
captures
their
interest
when
it
should
be
the
problem
of
acting
Think
of
Barton
Hill
Lizzie
Price
W
Davidge
Bob
Craig
John
Drew
Mrs
Drew
the
two
Walcots
Sam
Hemple
Ed
Marble
and
others
whose
names
may
be
found
in
the
annals
of
the
day
and
all
in
stock
company
Charles
Walcott
in
particular
was
a
versatile
actor
And
H
E
Meredith
Craig
was
always
comical
Why
any
one
of
these
men
and
women
would
be
stars
in
comparison
with
the
half
baked
professionals
of
to-day
Nor
is
this
belief
the
jaundiced
expression
of
a
bored
old
man
It
is
history
When
these
stock
companies
went
out
whether
in
Philadelphia
Boston
or
New
York
the
art
of
acting
deteriorated
The
average
plays
of
yester-year
were
no
better
than
those
of
the
new
century
Mediocrity
never
varies
but
the
actors
have
disappeared
And
the
movies
have
given
them
the
final
push
over
the
preci
pice
into
oblivion
P
S
My
father
made
the
same
complaint
circa
1875
THE
OLD
TOWN
The
Philadelphia
of
my
school-days
was
a
prettier
a
more
provincial
withal
a
pleasanter
place
to
live
in
than
the
Philadelphia
of
this
year
of
grace
I
was
younger
and
when
one
is
young
the
world
is
seen
through
en
chanted
spectacles
nevertheless
there
are
well-defined
criteria
by
the
aid
of
which
I
can
verify
my
childish
judgments
The
city
was
greener
trees
abounded
and
flowers
lawns
and
gardens
not
only
in
yards
but
facing
the
houses
Fountains
were
more
plentiful
The
rural
appearance
was
more
pronounced
a
grave
defect
in
the
eyes
of
tasteless
persons
who
prefer
the
ugliness
of
tall
factory-like
buildings
the
uncouth
mobs
and
hideous
noise
of
New
York
Philadelphia
to
be
sure
was
not
cosmopolitan
yet
it
was
more
attractive
and
at
the
risk
of
being
paradoxical
more
European
Certain
sections
of
The
Hague
Haarlem
Amsterdam
and
Utrecht
in
Hol
land
recall
to
me
the
city
of
my
early
youth
the
rather
prim
two
and
three
story
brick
residences
the
white
marble
steps
gardens
behind
and
the
immaculately
kept
brick
pavements
these
and
a
dozen
other
resemblances
came
to
my
mind
when
I
lived
in
the
Dutch
cities
of
whose
placid
well-ordered
life
I
am
exceedingly
fond
Best
of
all
to
a
musician
with
sensitive
ears
was
the
ab
sence
of
unnecessary
noise
for
there
is
unnecessary
as
well
as
unavoidable
noise
When
the
horse
cars
first
jogged
through
Seventh
Street
we
all
exclaimed
at
their
clangour
The
market
carts
which
came
in
from
Mont
gomery
County
at
dawn
on
Wednesday
and
Saturday
rumbled
over
the
cobble-stones
but
they
were
quiet
in
comparison
with
the
cars
And
now
the
overhead
trolley
is
deafening
It
fills
every
alley
with
its
buzzing
and
the
metallic
clanking
of
the
cars
put
Philadelphia
on
the
map
as
one
of
the
noisiest
cities
in
the
Union
No
fear
any
longer
of
the
cruel
aspersion
of
rusticity
The
grass
does
not
grow
in
the
streets
The
city
is
be
come
a
metropolis
if
it
is
only
the
metropolis
of
Pennsyl
vania
Remember
I
am
not
finding
fault
I
am
merely
telling
you
that
fifty
years
ago
Philadelphia
was
a
sweet
er-smelling
more
picturesque
and
a
less
noisy
spot
than
now
The
population
that
of
an
important
town
but
not
too
populous
There
were
many
Germans
few
French
or
Italians
some
English
and
a
rapidly
growing
influx
of
Hebrews
But
we
all
mixed
well
After
the
Native
American
outburst
in
the
early
forties
the
city
settled
down
and
until
the
Civil
War
its
peace
and
prosperity
were
practically
undisturbed
A
comfortable
city
with
plenty
of
elbow-room
good
cheap
markets
superior
cookery
service
of
a
sort
long
since
vanished
and
a
social
life
which
while
it
had
its
exclusiveness
its
snob
bish
reactions
did
not
impeach
the
mass
of
the
people
from
sanely
enjoying
life
Yes
I
fully
admit
the
pro
vinciality
They
are
still
narrow
minded
concerning
innovation
particularly
in
the
Seven
Arts
Philadel
phia
has
always
been
prudish
and
not
without
a
taint
of
hypocrisy
As
to
the
snobbery
that
is
the
extension
of
the
old
Tory
spirit
Philadelphia
boasted
an
aristoc
racy
in
the
early
eighteenth
century
still
boasts
one
Families
with
a
pedigree
that
go
back
to
the
glacial
epoch
continue
to
live
on
side-streets
poor
but
solemnly
proud
It
is
a
flattering
illusion
this
ancient
family
tree
and
only
cruel
iconoclasts
care
to
destroy
it
In
the
broader
aspects
of
life
in
First
and
Last
Things
Philadelphia
has
always
been
pre-eminent
religion
patriotism
the
family
For
new-fangled
heretical
inventions
she
has
ever
shown
a
distaste
She
has
been
called
a
village
a
vil
lage
when
she
boasted
a
million
inhabitants
and
she
is
voted
slow
by
visitors
from
the
Bronx
or
Flatbush
But
this
is
another
delusion
like
the
noiseless
legend
If
the
truth
be
told
and
it
may
wound
the
moral
sensi
bilities
of
some
Philadelphia
is
an
extremely
lively
resort
from
which
strangers
hurry
to
recuperate
at
ease
in
Manhattan
The
hospitality
is
occasionally
excessive
the
civic
thirst
abundant
I
speak
nowise
in
an
apolo
getic
fashion
A
great
city
should
live
freely
largely
though
not
loosely
Ha
The
settlement
by
the
Quakers
lent
to
William
Penn
s
Town
a
spirit
of
sobriety
The
Quaker
bonnets
dove
coloured
gowns
shad-bellied
coats
and
broad-brimmed
hats
were
to
be
seen
everywhere
when
I
was
young
The
women
old
or
youthful
were
pleasing
to
gaze
upon
demure
glances
did
not
detract
from
the
charm
of
the
girls
The
graveyard
on
Race
Street
the
Meeting
House
on
Fifteenth
Street
the
silent
services
where
grace
descended
without
the
assistance
of
brass
bands
baboon
antics
or
newspaper
notoriety
this
Quaker
cult
was
very
attractive
in
its
simplicity
and
sincerity
Down-town
the
males
of
the
flock
drove
shrewd
bargains
Not
even
a
Rothschild
could
beat
a
Quaker
in
the
real-estate
game
They
said
thee
instead
of
thou
but
the
quaint
friendliness
of
the
address
excused
its
incorrectness
Despite
the
more
vivid
garish
display
of
colours
and
exotic
costumes
of
our
streets
the
absence
of
the
Quaker
garb
is
a
distinct
loss
It
was
a
peculiarly
personal
note
in
the
civic
symphony
The
Salvation
Army
costume
by
no
means
replaces
it
The
town
was
far
from
being
built
in
1870
The
sub
urbs
had
a
disconcerting
way
of
bobbing
up
after
you
went
further
north
than
Columbia
Avenue
We
seldom
dared
West
Philadelphia
or
the
more
tremendous
neigh
bourhood
of
the
Neck
Young
rowdies
made
life
unsafe
when
out
of
our
own
bailiwick
I
invariably
took
one
route
to
school
I
would
leave
the
house
at
eight
trav
erse
Seventh
Street
to
Spring
Garden
never
forgetting
to
look
at
the
house
where
lived
Edgar
Allan
Poe
We
then
would
traverse
Spring
Garden
a
street
of
delightful
shade
till
we
reached
Broad
Down
that
wide
avenue
of
noise
and
bustle
we
went
to
Pine
Street
and
there
the
doors
of
the
school
yawned
for
us
It
took
exactly
one
hour
for
the
trip
not
a
slow
record
considering
the
slim
ness
of
our
legs
We
hated
Seventh
Street
because
of
that
inordinately
long
block
or
square
between
Girard
Avenue
and
Poplar
Street
But
before
the
Baldwin
Locomotive
Works
we
stood
transported
My
passion
for
machinery
became
inflamed
by
the
spectacle
of
a
monster
locomotive
suspended
its
wheels
whirling
at
the
rate
of
sixty
or
seventy
miles
an
hour
It
was
the
final
try-out
With
full
steam
the
machine
stood
on
a
vast
truck
and
ran
on
imaginary
rails
officials
and
en
gineers
in
the
cab
No
conjurer
s
show
or
transformation
scene
in
pantomime
so
enthralled
me
I
had
no
premoni
tion
that
later
I
should
be
a
humble
member
of
the
great
army
enrolled
under
the
flag
of
Mathias
Baldwin
Mat
thew
Baird
Charles
Parry
and
others
of
the
extraor
dinary
organisation
with
its
three
thousand
employes
now
five
times
the
number
and
its
capacity
for
turning
out
daily
a
locomotive
completed
Yes
the
shops
were
a
magnet
going
and
coming
from
school
Above
Cal
lowhill
Street
we
met
a
dangerous
obstacle
the
unpro
tected
tracks
of
the
Reading
Railroad
We
had
already
passed
our
first
on
crossing
the
tracks
of
the
Chestnut
Hill
and
Germantown
Railroad
and
as
a
rule
we
avoided
these
by
going
west
via
Spring
Garden
The
Reading
Railroad
was
another
fascination
the
shifting
of
the
trains
often
made
us
late
at
school
with
the
usual
penalty
of
a
pensum
of
a
hundred
lines
after
hours
a
singularly
idiotic
and
gratuitous
form
of
punishment
Another
dangerous
diversion
and
temptation
was
Penn
Square
then
in
four
public
parks
railed
in
as
was
years
before
Union
Square
in
New
York
Henry
James
remembers
the
latter
but
I
don
t
think
our
greatest
master
of
fiction
ever
saw
Penn
Square
upon
which
now
stands
the
ugliest
municipal
building
in
the
United
States
bar
none
Even
Camden
Trenton
Brooklyn
make
more
appeal
to
the
aesthetic
eye
than
this
clumsy
congeries
of
jumbled
architecture
surmounted
by
a
statue
that
bor
ders
on
the
blasphemous
and
burlesque
But
at
the
period
of
which
I
am
talking
the
parks
with
their
green
gravelled
walks
proved
a
soothing
interval
in
a
morning
s
walk
Perhaps
Mr
James
would
have
found
these
breathing
spaces
evocative
of
old
London
The
dignified
residences
the
shade
trees
the
leisurely
traffic
the
splendid
sweep
of
Broad
Street
which
one
could
sur
vey
north
and
south
these
were
more
agreeable
than
the
present
encumbrance
which
might
have
been
so
modified
as
to
leave
our
show
street
unimpeded
from
end
to
end
Were
these
public
buildings
erected
as
an
ineluctable
barrier
to
balk
the
hungry
social
aspirations
of
the
out
casts
north
of
Market
Street
Or
were
the
beautiful
parks
butchered
to
make
a
politicians
holiday
Who
shall
say
I
don
t
know
but
I
do
know
that
I
was
repri
manded
more
than
once
a
week
for
tarrying
in
this
de
lectable
region
Below
Market
Broad
Street
was
lined
with
homes
although
the
La
Pierre
House
then
a
leading
hotel
stood
near
Chestnut
Street
The
Academy
of
Natural
Sciences
was
if
I
remember
rightly
at
the
corner
of
Sansom
Street
on
the
west
side
of
Broad
Street
A
certain
slender
agile
bright-eyed
young
man
was
always
ready
to
help
us
when
we
sought
paleontological
mysteries
We
craved
for
the
buried
bones
of
what
not
impossible
saurian
If
there
had
been
a
giant
crustacean
we
should
not
have
been
surprised
Everything
happens
in
childhood
even
flying-machines
and
pterodactyls
With
a
patience
that
was
touching
Dr
Edward
J
Nolan
took
us
from
case
to
case
from
room
to
room
Although
he
may
have
forgotten
this
it
is
so
and
the
now
distinguished
librarian
and
scientist
still
occupies
I
am
happy
to
say
the
same
position
at
the
new
academy
on
Logan
Square
although
he
doesn
t
have
the
time
to
pilot
around
his
little
friends
for
the
most
part
grey-beards
Otherwise
I
don
t
find
Broad
Street
considerably
altered
as
to
facades
The
old
Natatorium
is
abolished
but
the
building
stands
across
the
street
from
the
Art
Club
that
jewel
of
archi
tecture
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
the
Bellevue-Stratford
In
the
Natatorium
the
two
Payne
brothers
taught
the
young
idea
how
to
swim
They
were
German
one
smooth-spoken
the
other
brusque
I
can
t
recall
which
was
Jules
but
he
taught
me
my
first
strokes
as
in
a
dream
I
hear
his
guttural
Ein
zwei
three
for
he
mixed
languages
We
went
there
daily
in
the
summer
time
A
season
ticket
was
not
costly
You
could
hire
trunks
or
bring
your
own
My
chief
memory
of
the
place
apart
from
many
pleasant
hours
in
the
water
was
the
split
skull
I
got
from
diving
in
shallow
water
It
served
me
right
I
was
showing
off
and
the
conse
quences
might
have
been
fatal
I
still
carry
a
part
alas
a
widening
one
with
the
years
in
my
hair
caused
by
the
scar
I
received
For
that
trick
I
was
scolded
by
Mr
Payne
and
banished
eight
days
Years
before
the
advent
of
the
Rathskeller
above
Chestnut
Street
high
buildings
are
comparatively
re
cent
there
was
a
small
but
well-known
resort
on
the
west
side
of
Broad
between
Chestnut
and
Penn
Square
It
was
called
The
Keg
and
kept
by
the
Gasslein
brothers
Joseph
and
Charles
the
sons
of
old
man
Gass
lein
who
had
a
place
fifty
years
ago
further
up
town
on
Callowhill
or
Noble
Street
The
Keg
so
called
be
cause
of
its
symbolic
barrel
over
the
entrance
enter
tained
many
distinguished
visitors
There
was
a
little
garden
at
the
rear
with
rustic
tables
The
cheer
was
simple
but
pure
I
wish
I
could
say
the
same
of
con
temporary
brews
the
company
varied
and
usually
in
teresting
Joe
Gasslein
since
dead
was
an
amiable
host
I
once
saw
Edwin
Booth
there
in
company
with
his
manager
and
to
his
amusement
as
well
as
sorrow
he
heard
spouted
Hamlet
s
speech
to
the
players
by
an
old
fellow-actor
ruined
by
drink
A
capital
fellow
and
an
excellent
mime
His
first
name
was
Joseph
and
when
he
whispered
into
the
sympathetic
ear
of
Mr
Booth
it
was
done
with
the
sinister
air
of
lago
poisoning
Othello
s
mind
Poor
old
Joe
He
had
supported
Booth
Bar
rett
John
McCuIIough
had
been
in
the
company
of
Adelaide
Neilson
A
man
of
ability
educated
in
the
best
stock
companies
of
good
presence
he
let
himself
slip
down-stream
and
because
of
a
love-affair
But
usually
when
a
man
with
an
alcoholic
breath
tells
me
that
a
broken
heart
drove
him
to
rum
I
suspect
him
He
would
have
drunk
even
if
he
had
married
the
girl
Women
may
be
blamed
for
a
lot
of
things
but
they
are
too
often
a
convenient
excuse
for
a
thirsty
throat
Joe
had
that
in
excelsis
He
was
playing
at
Wood
s
Museum
at
Ninth
and
Arch
Streets
at
this
time
I
am
years
ahead
in
my
narrative
and
played
villains
with
terrific
force
A
shocking
villain
How
we
shivered
at
his
curses
deep
in
Jack
Harkaway
when
as
Barboni
the
brigand
he
swore
to
be
avenged
on
jesting
Jack
And
in
Ruth
or
the
Curse
of
Rum
how
awful
was
his
remorse
his
de
lirium
tremens
and
his
death
Father
dear
father
come
home
with
me
now
the
clock
in
the
steeple
strikes
one
or
was
it
nine
But
that
touching
verse
which
wets
my
eyes
and
dries
my
throat
probably
association
of
ideas
was
spoken
in
Ten
Nights
in
a
Barroom
not
in
Ruth
After
either
piece
Joe
would
appear
at
the
Keg
thirstier
than
ever
No
wonder
How
few
recall
the
old
actor
Perhaps
John
Gasslein
perhaps
Albert
J
Hetherington
with
his
miraculous
Pepys-Iike
memory
and
myself
The
Keg
has
gone
the
way
of
all
liquid
If
the
weather
was
rainy
we
rode
generally
in
the
Tenth
Street
cars
then
crossed
over
Pine
to
Broad
A
favourite
return
from
school
was
up
Ninth
Street
There
stood
above
Green
Street
near
the
old
depot
there
were
depots
in
those
days
not
stations
a
restaurant
where
the
fish-cakes
were
ideal
The
price
too
was
ideal
ten
cents
with
oyster
soup
obligingly
thrown
in
by
the
oysterman
Did
they
taste
But
ten-cent
pieces
were
rare
In
this
establishment
I
first
heard
re
cited
We
don
t
give
bread
with
one
fish-ball
and
by
a
school
companion
Philip
DoIIard
The
appositeness
of
the
recitation
lay
in
the
fact
that
they
would
not
give
us
bread
with
our
fish-cake
Ain
t
potatoes
as
fillin
as
bread
fer
ye
demanded
the
guardian
This
was
about
of
Jim
Fisk
s
shooting
and
the
name
of
Josie
Mansfield
Our
curiosity
was
further
piqued
on
learning
that
Ed
Stokes
the
slayer
hailed
from
our
town
and
was
of
Quaker
stock
What
gossip
ensued
on
upper
Franklin
Street
and
the
vicinage
Another
vanished
landmark
was
the
old
Bellevue
at
the
corner
of
Broad
and
Walnut
Streets
where
now
stands
the
Manufacturers
Club
The
late
George
Boldt
di
rected
this
hotel
whose
cuisine
was
noted
for
its
quality
It
boasted
many
distinguished
guests
not
to
mention
the
Clover
Club
dinners
famous
for
their
witty
sessions
Colonel
William
M
Bunn
one
time
Governor
of
Idaho
often
presided
I
recollect
his
lithe
figure
and
charac
teristic
head
steel-grey
eyes
and
imperturbable
bearing
He
looked
then
not
unlike
Robert
Mantell
He
still
lives
Fred
Fotterall
Dick
Townsend
Ned
Rogers
known
as
Montezuma
and
the
nephew
of
Fairman
Rogers
the
noted
driver
frequented
the
Bellevue
which
had
an
atmosphere
its
stately
successor
has
not
duplicated
Ah
the
pathos
of
distance
The
younger
Rogers
was
a
great
swell
and
his
abundant
side-whiskers
called
Piccadilly
Weepers
after
Lord
Dundreary
s
advent
were
the
envy
of
the
younger
crowd
This
nickname
is
quite
venerable
in
England
where
as
a
challenge
the
costers
used
to
plaster
a
curl
of
hair
on
either
side
of
their
temples
and
call
the
ornaments
New
gate
Knockers
in
French
the
bullies
of
the
Fau
bourgs
call
them
Accroche-Coeurs
i
e
heart-hookers
The
blond
magnificence
of
Montezuma
Rogers
made
my
heart
beat
He
seemed
to
step
from
a
page
of
Ouida
illustrated
by
George
du
Maurier
Incidentally
I
may
remark
that
I
owed
him
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
he
saved
me
from
a
nasty
fall
down
an
open
trap
in
front
of
Lip
pincott
s
book-shop
where
I
had
been
staring
at
titles
He
saw
me
backing
towards
the
trap
and
rapped
over
my
heedless
shoulders
his
dandy
s
stick
saying
to
Dick
Townsend
There
s
a
Johnny
Look-in-the-Air
for
you
Dazzled
by
his
weepers
I
didn
t
have
presence
of
mind
enough
to
blurt
out
my
thanks
A
handsome
trio
Rogers
Fotterall
and
Townsend
all
have
since
crossed
the
great
divide
Another
good-looking
set
was
com
posed
of
Stephen
Whitman
Emile
Perdriaux
and
Prince
Iturbide
the
latter
a
gay
young
Mexican
who
seemed
as
if
he
had
just
deserted
the
Paris
boulevards
AH
these
men
went
to
the
Bellevue
So
did
Brooke
Dolan
Frank
McLaughlin
Frank
Ash
Paul
Huneker
Burt
Lee
and
other
kindred
souls
I
never
discovered
who
threw
the
big
and
costly
crystal
punch-bowl
of
the
Bellevue
into
the
middle
of
Broad
Street
and
then
danced
some
sort
of
a
savage
ritual
over
the
fragments
Whenever
I
ques
tioned
Mr
Boldt
at
the
Waldorf-Astoria
his
memory
would
become
hazy
But
he
did
tell
me
who
footed
the
by
no
means
insignificant
bill
There
were
ructions
and
the
rumour
of
ructions
for
a
long
time
Here
are
a
few
additional
names

the
old

I

I

Lewis

though
he

E

Davenport
in

role
Charlotte
Cushman
I
saw
once
as
Meg
Merrilees
but
she
was
too
old
for
my
young
eyes
a
hag
spouting
fire
and
fury
a
terrible
creature
who
caused
me
more
than
one
night
mare
Our

the

E

one
of
my

orics
Next
to
Salvini

I
never

acting
The
summit

liked

I
AM
A
PENMAN
To
recapture
the
first
careless
rapture
as
Browning
sings
is
not
easy
if
indeed
possible
What
the
critics
call
the
innocence
of
the
eye
is
seldom
renewed
Some
artists
possessed
the
virtue
their
life
long
Titian
and
Frans
Hals
for
example
Any
one
who
has
visited
Haarlem
will
remember
that
veracious
group
of
old
Dutch
ladies
painted
when
the
artist
was
past
eighty
and
the
town
drunkard
Well
those
were
exceptions
Lesser
mortals
must
be
contented
with
only
one
optical
virginity
and
if
that
is
sufficiently
vivid
to
accompany
him
on
his
progress
to
the
Hollow
Vale
he
should
not
complain
With
me
memories
of
inanimate
objects
houses
streets
trees
sounds
and
scents
are
in
the
nature
of
hallucinations
They
appear
in
puissant
relief
But
to
pin
down
to
paper
these
waking
dreams
that
s
the
rub
For
instance
there
are
bosky
avenues
on
the
west
drive
of
Fairmount
Park
through
which
I
could
find
my
way
blindfolded
on
a
dark
stormy
night
And
a
certain
bench
just
below
Strawberry
Mansion
on
which
I
sat
of
moonlit
summer
nights
how
many
years
ago
and
held
hands
with
a
girl
who
had
the
golden
tresses
of
the
Venetian
school
Giorgione
Paris
Bordone
Tiziano
Elaine
Elaine
That
bench
I
see
in
all
its
enchant
ing
angularities
whenever
I
close
my
eyes
and
ring
up
my
cerebral
Central
Fairmount
Park
1880
After
I
had
attained
the
age
of
unreason
which
sets
in
with
a
man
at
his
fifteenth
year
or
thereabouts
I
was
discovered
as
a
penman
whose
handwriting
bid
fair
to
outshine
in
illegibility
the
classic
scrawl
of
Horace
Greeley
you
have
read
Mark
Twain
Since
then
every
news
paper
office
that
I
worked
in
has
made
a
rediscovery
of
this
disconcerting
fact
The
Evening
Bulletin
The
Re
corder
The
Morning
Advertiser
The
Sun
The
Times
and
The
Press
chapels
recognise
my
penmanship
a
block
away
There
was
a
standard
joke
in
one
composing
room
the
compositor
who
set
up
my
copy
and
the
proofreader
who
corrected
it
poor
dear
chaps
were
always
pensioned
by
the
proprietor
when
they
went
to
the
blind
asylum
Gallows-humour
this
but
it
threw
some
light
on
my
case
My
mother
realised
that
my
script
was
impossible
I
had
recovered
from
the
loco
motive
craze
and
after
discussion
I
was
sent
to
the
writing
academy
of
Samuel
Dickson
on
Dock
near
Wal
nut
Street
He
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
my
father
and
one
morning
after
commending
me
to
his
good
graces
my
father
left
me
in
anything
but
a
cheerful
mood
con
fronted
by
paper
and
pens
the
sight
of
which
then
pro
duced
nausea
as
they
even
now
do
only
I
call
it
eye
strain
it
sounds
more
important
more
pathological
when
it
is
really
old-fashioned
laziness
To
reach
Dr
Dickson
s
Academy
a
pretentious
title
for
shabby
chambers
I
daily
walked
down
Seventh
Street
and
turned
eastward
at
Girard
Avenue
The
old
market
houses
low
shambling
one-story
structures
ran
for
blocks
as
far
as
Eighth
Street
or
Ninth
Street
the
Chest
nut
Hill
Railroad
tracks
perhaps
they
extended
further
even
as
far
as
Twelfth
Street
but
I
m
not
sure
They
were
jolly
bustling
resorts
for
all
the
housewives
in
the
ward
Walking
down
the
avenue
I
would
stop
at
St
Peter
s
German
Church
go
in
sometimes
not
to
pray
but
to
hear
old
Pop
Hertel
play
the
organ
an
instrument
of
which
I
am
fond
There
was
a
candy
shop
at
the
corner
of
Fifth
Street
where
gingerbread
was
to
be
had
at
fabulously
low
prices
The
beldame
who
kept
the
shop
was
a
creature
who
alternately
bullied
and
wheedled
her
childish
clientele
Her
usual
expression
reminded
me
of
the
sour-sweet
taste
of
cream
thunder-turned
She
was
of
German
origin
and
the
school
children
said
she
was
a
witch
a
gingerbread
witch
Fiercely
she
would
lean
and
ask
Vot
ye
vant
to
which
the
inevitable
an
swer
was
Vot
ye
got
Vot
ye
want
she
would
repeat
in
menacing
tones
Vot
ye
got
was
the
Irish
echo
This
silly
litany
would
go
on
sometimes
for
five
minutes
Her
features
never
changed
her
eyes
never
twinkled
yet
I
believe
she
enjoyed
the
game
of
question
and
answer
though
once
I
saw
her
take
off
her
wooden
shoe
and
chase
an
irreverent
boy
who
dared
to
upset
her
scheme
by
asking
first
Vot
ye
vant
This
an
noyed
her
like
Sarah
Battle
at
whist
she
must
have
the
rigour
of
the
game
as
well
as
a
clean
hearth
Slowly
sauntering
down
Fifth
Street
I
would
proceed
as
if
on
a
visit
to
the
dentist
When
I
arrived
at
Fair
mount
Avenue
I
would
gaze
across
the
street
at
the
residence
of
the
Hon
Daniel
M
Fox
once
Mayor
of
the
city
and
would
note
the
window
in
his
bedroom
from
which
on
election
night
he
made
a
speech
to
his
con
stituents
Old
York
Road
achieved
I
footed
down
its
inviting
width
There
was
at
the
junction
of
Fifth
Street
and
the
Road
the
Betz
Brewery
Only
a
year
ago
I
retraced
my
early
footsteps
but
my
souvenirs
were
pleasanter
than
the
realities
of
1918
Old
York
Road
had
well
kept
residences
in
my
youth
now
the
entire
thoroughfare
is
sadly
down
at
the
heels
Shabby
is
perhaps
too
complimentary
a
word
for
it
I
noticed
that
our
East
Side
is
rapidly
keeping
company
with
New
York
s
After
a
visit
to
Essex
and
Grand
Streets
in
East
Side
Jerusalem
Disinfected
He
exaggerated
slightly
though
not
as
to
racial
roots
In
certain
quar
ters
of
our
town
you
feel
as
if
in
some
foreign
ghetto
Vienna
Budapest
Cracow
Warsaw
I
was
depressed
by
my
walk
the
poverty
the
absence
of
foliage
the
crowds
all
reminded
me
of
the
Yiddish
belt
in
New
York
I
looked
in
vain
for
the
Italian
colony
which
is
elsewhere
Franklin
Square
had
nicely
kept
residences
but
no
longer
though
the
old
Fox
mansion
on
Fifth
Street
is
precisely
as
it
was
York
Road
alone
has
changed
On
Sixth
Street
my
eyes
were
astonished
by
the
name
of
Martin
Wisler
over
a
furniture
wareroom
Impossible
I
went
to
the
door
on
the
sill
of
which
stood
a
young
man
with
blond
curly
hair
Again
im
possible
In
the
seventies
I
often
passed
this
es
tablishment
and
always
saluted
by
his
name
young
Wisler
cheerful
blond
curly-haired
There
he
stood
the
same
lad
with
the
jolly
smile
and
yet
he
was
differ
ent
years
bring
their
changes
I
inquired
of
him
his
name
He
told
me
He
was
a
Wisler
My
father
s
inside
at
his
desk
Go
in
he
will
be
glad
to
see
an
old
friend
you
won
t
find
him
much
changed
I
peeped
in
Yes
there
sat
Martin
Wisler
and
he
did
look
many
years
younger
than
he
should
have
considering
that
he
was
my
contemporary
But
I
hadn
t
the
courage
to
enter
I
feared
I
was
the
one
who
had
changed
feared
that
he
wouldn
t
remember
me
unless
I
told
my
name
So
I
whispered
to
his
son
Another
time
your
father
is
busy
Never
mind
my
name
I
ll
surprise
him
again
and
I
saved
myself
by
flight
I
was
a
moral
coward
that
afternoon
Or
was
it
vanity
I
would
pass
St
Augustine
s
with
its
dramatic
history
how
often
has
my
mother
told
of
the
wild
night
when
it
burned
down
to
the
drunken
howls
of
frenzied
native
Americans
Finally
at
Walnut
where
it
debouches
into
Dock
I
could
see
my
goal
my
jail
I
called
it
Dock
Street
and
its
surroundings
have
changed
surprisingly
little
The
house
where
lived
my
writing-master
still
stands
and
still
needs
a
coat
of
paint
When
I
would
enter
on
the
second
floor
there
sat
a
portly
middle-aged
gentleman
of
negro
strain
His
broad
face
flat
nose
eyes
showing
plenty
of
white
were
unmistakably
negroid
which
his
shining
coffee-coloured
skin
did
not
deny
He
always
wore
his
hat
indoors
and
out
as
Walt
Whitman
would
say
I
was
told
the
reason
His
hair
was
kinky
hence
the
hat
It
was
a
tall
stovepipe
of
ancient
lineage
and
was
almost
covered
by
a
deep
mourning-band
He
was
probably
a
native
of
an
English-speaking
West
Indian
Island
His
speech
was
excellent
English
yet
softly
streaked
by
something
exotic
He
used
big
words
He
wrote
formidable
phrases
His
handwriting
was
in
my
eyes
extraordinary
A
master
of
all
styles
from
the
conventional
Spencerian
to
the
ornamental
letters
used
in
addresses
testimonials
and
the
like
he
was
a
first
class
craftsman
A
clear
round
hand
my
boy
he
would
say
to
me
though
his
kindly
expression
would
be
replaced
by
a
vexed
one
after
he
watched
my
futile
at
tempts
He
would
then
sigh
remove
his
owlish
horn
spectacles
wipe
his
vast
forehead
without
removing
that
eternal
hat
and
then
without
modulation
whatsoever
would
exclaim
Ah
James
the
Magorians
James
If
it
wasn
t
for
those
Magorians
life
would
be
all
skittles
and
beer
And
I
thinking
this
a
quotation
would
en
courage
him
with
a
wan
smile
The
Magorians
What
the
deuce
were
Magorians
I
often
puzzled
over
this
enigma
of
the
Dock
Street
sphinx
The
Magorians
Were
they
the
Babylonish
scarlet-women
from
the
Seven
Hills
I
never
encountered
painted
Jezebels
on
Dock
Street
unless
the
limber-hipped
unkempt
fishwives
who
paraded
after
dark
in
quest
of
fresh
air
not
human
bait
What
did
old
man
Dickson
mean
by
the
Magorians
I
did
not
dare
ask
him
because
he
was
a
Turveydrop
in
deportment
a
Turveydrop
of
the
ink-well
that
Dickens
would
have
appreciated
I
asked
my
elders
but
they
all
leaned
heavily
on
the
scarlet-woman
theory
especially
William
Hewitt
the
portraitist
He
means
the
girls
he
would
mutter
If
so
why
then
the
British
symbol
of
skittles
and
beer
Even
at
that
ingenuous
age
girls
and
skittles
and
beer
formed
an
indissoluble
trinity
And
why
precisely
Magorians
a
lurid
suggestive
word
a
planetary
word
I
remembered
having
read
a
tale
by
Douglas
Jerrold
its
title
forgotten
which
described
a
fashionable
soiree
in
London
At
the
height
of
the
fes
tivities
as
the
society
reporter
would
say
a
little
fusty
old
fellow
attired
as
a
cobbler
appeared
in
the
drawing
room
He
made
his
way
to
the
hostess
blazing
in
her
diamonds
arrayed
like
a
queen
Squatting
before
her
in
true
shoemaker
pose
he
shook
his
forefinger
at
her
Now
Sue
he
said
now
Sue
this
will
never
do
Put
on
your
clothes
and
come
home
Or
words
to
that
effect
The
denouement
There
was
none
She
quickly
left
the
room
returning
in
a
few
minutes
en
veloped
in
a
shawl
1850
and
white
faced
and
with
staring
eyes
went
away
with
the
mysterious
stranger
Her
husband
Or
did
she
owe
him
a
hopeless
bill
for
cobbling
Jerrold
doesn
t
explain
The
story
left
a
queer
taste
in
my
memory
So
did
the
Magorians
In
the
meantime
my
handwriting
steadily
became
worse
It
s
as
bad
now
as
it
was
four
decades
ago
and
as
I
can
t
use
a
clanking
typewriter
and
won
t
dictate
I
have
been
forced
to
write
millions
of
words
And
yet
I
call
myself
lazy
Basta
Despite
the
talk
about
living
in
the
open
air
and
active
sports
I
think
the
boys
of
my
day
were
hardier
and
less
spoiled
Of
the
girls
I
can
t
speak
with
au
thority
No
doubt
they
were
more
coddled
more
pro
tected
then
and
the
voice
of
the
chaperone
was
heard
in
the
land
For
a
young
woman
to
go
alone
with
her
young
man
to
a
theatre
or
a
ball
would
have
hopelessly
riddled
her
reputation
The
young
ladies
of
various
fash
ionable
boarding-schools
were
given
their
morning
and
afternoon
walk
up
and
down
Walnut
Street
or
around
Rittenhouse
Square
which
like
Logan
was
railed
in
These
processions
with
the
girls
paired-off
were
events
for
the
young
chaps
What
pretty
girls
they
were
Dostoievsky
has
written
there
are
no
old
women
an
old
woman
is
younger
than
an
old
man
Anyhow
the
girls
were
pretty
then
The
Chegaray
Institute
in
par
ticular
piqued
our
juvenile
gallants
This
choir
of
Iambs
were
fleecier
softer-eyed
plumper
and
comelier
than
other
flocks
They
had
the
innocence
of
the
ser
pent
the
wisdom
of
the
dove
They
never
flirted
They
only
looked
at
you
And
then
your
aggressive
mas
culinity
crumpled
before
the
idol
Occasionally
in
the
spring
of
the
year
when
the
moon
was
full
they
be
trayed
a
disposition
to
throw
their
little
bonnets
over
the
windmill
which
was
natural
but
Madame
Chegaray
who
was
an
experienced
tactician
knew
how
to
handle
the
situation
She
grimly
told
any
mother
that
when
the
crisis
became
acute
she
dosed
her
refractory
patients
with
a
good
old-fashioner
1
remedy
brimstone
and
molasses
The
rest
is
silence
THE
GOSSIP
OF
THE
DAY
The
startling
sensations
of
the
day
such
as
the
Fisk
Stokes
shooting
the
James
Gordon
Bennett
Fred-May
duel
the
cataclysmic
earthquake
and
tidal
wave
in
Peru
1868
when
an
American
battleship
was
safely
landed
in
the
hills
among
the
trees
far
from
the
water
Colonel
Bob
IngersoIPs
lectures
temperance
revivals
the
Keeley
motor
the
new
dietary
of
Dio
Lewis
bustles
chignons
and
the
divorce
of
Adelina
Patti
from
her
rake
Marquis
de
Caux
the
Beecher-Tilton
case
Lydia
Thompson
s
Blondes
these
and
a
thousand
others
fluttered
our
ex
citable
young
brains
I
regret
now
not
having
kept
a
commonplace-book
It
would
prove
a
guide
for
a
rapidly
failing
memory
I
do
however
remember
that
after
Fred
May
cowhided
Bennett
on
the
sidewalk
of
the
Union
Club
there
was
a
challenge
and
the
duel
came
off
somewhere
in
Maryland
This
was
denied
the
other
day
when
Bennett
died
He
had
been
engaged
to
Miss
Caroline
May
the
sister
of
the
aggressor
who
only
did
what
any
other
brother
should
have
done
James
Gor
don
Bennett
as
a
young
man
was
heroic
in
his
cups
that
is
his
capacity
was
that
of
a
hero
Byron
or
Landor
said
that
brandy
was
fit
for
heroes
It
was
really
old
Sam
Johnson
who
said
it
first
He
didn
t
know
the
proprietor
of
the
Herald
who
was
heroic
with
champagne
as
well
as
brandy
Bennett
often
repeated
and
accord
ing
to
the
newspapers
of
the
period
I
read
the
Phila
delphia
Times
9
account
he
told
Fred
May
he
was
sorry
that
he
wasn
t
worthy
of
his
sister
but
later
said
that
he
would
give
any
man
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
take
her
off
his
hands
Times
He
was
cowhided
for
this
and
the
duel
followed
a
French
duel
I
suppose
as
the
participants
lived
many
years
This
was
one
episode
in
the
extraordinary
career
of
that
extraordinary
man
Commodore
Bennett
who
was
surely
made
to
figure
in
fiction
or
drama
The
Peruvian
earthquake
at
Arica
caused
as
much
excitement
as
the
one
in
San
Francisco
As
for
Bob
IngersoII
and
his
warmed-over
Voltaire
and
Huxley
I
can
only
speak
by
repute
He
raised
an
awful
rumpus
more
of
a
rumpus
than
even
Darwin
Tyndall
and
Hux
ley
combined
Those
were
the
days
of
Star
course
lectures
T
B
Pugh
or
Major
Pond
managed
them
We
had
Gough
the
temperance
agitator
Proctor
the
English
astronomer
the
beautiful
Mrs
Scott-Siddons
lustrous-eyed
but
lacking
dramatic
temperament
the
South
American
pianiste
Teresita
Carreno
another
beauty
Seraphael
the
boy-wonder
really
Henry
Waller
the
English
pianist
said
to
be
a
scion
of
royalty
the
son
of
the
P-e
of
W-s
as
the
society
journals
subtly
put
it
Leopold
Lichtenberg
the
biggest
violin
talent
of
the
country
the
elder
Bellew
in
Shakespearean
read
ings
and
scholarly
readings
they
proved
and
how
many
others
I
remember
at
one
of
these
affairs
not
quite
so
ghastly
as
Chautauqua
lyceum
courses
a
pro
hibition
humbug
drank
water
all
evening
and
at
the
close
of
his
speech
he
was
so
het
up
by
enthusiasm
for
the
cause
that
he
stumbled
and
fell
as
he
left
the
stage
The
curtain
was
quickly
rung
down
Gin
like
water
is
colourless
Father
Tom
Burke
filled
us
with
joy
by
his
attacks
on
the
Sassenach
Ireland
is
always
about
to
be
but
never
is
free
We
went
to
the
circus
then
Adam
Forepaugh
s
on
North
Broad
Street
and
Smith
s
Island
in
the
Delaware
was
a
haven
of
happi
ness
A
Coney
Island
in
miniature
without
its
dis
agreeable
drawbacks
we
swam
and
were
at
peace
with
the
world
But
the
island
was
a
menace
to
navigation
and
it
too
disappeared
like
so
many
other
pleasant
things
Nor
should
I
forget
the
excursions
on
the
little
Schuylkill
River
steamboats
Fairmount
Park
after
Independence
Hall
the
crown
ing
glory
of
Philadelphia
was
then
as
now
a
wonderful
playground
The
approaches
to
it
were
not
imposing
as
they
will
be
when
the
new
boulevard
is
completed
The
entrance
at
Callowhill
Street
was
distinctly
depress
ing
dark
damp
dirty
but
the
old
waterworks
the
mysterious
wheels
above
all
the
smell
of
brackish
water
stirred
our
childish
imaginations
What
a
pretty
walk
was
that
along
the
river
till
the
last
boat-clubhouse
was
passed
Trotting
horses
attached
to
modish
traps
buggies
and
the
selfish
sulky
with
its
solitary
driver
flew
by
harness
shining
the
metal
on
the
spokes
glitter
ing
in
the
sunshine
which
seemed
more
suave
than
now
Philadelphia
summers
are
trying
because
of
their
per
sistent
sultriness
There
is
no
salty
sea-breeze
at
sun
down
to
relieve
the
heated
atmosphere
as
in
luckier
Gotham
Yet
we
never
suffered
Children
seldom
do
We
jumped
and
romped
rolled
hoops
shot
our
marbles
kept
our
nurses
shivering
with
fright
when
we
fell
over
board
in
the
park
fountains
and
at
the
end
of
a
perfect
day
we
would
run
home
all
the
way
from
Lemon
Hill
eat
till
our
tiny
waists
would
bloat
go
to
bed
and
sleep
the
untroubled
sleep
of
little

The
park
seemed
more
umbrageous
then
I
say
seemed
for
it
is
precisely
the
same
probably
plus
more
trees
and
if
I
seem
to
make
unfavourable
com
parison
it
is
only
seeming
Sans
teeth
sans
hair
sans
strength
and
spirits
his
youth
to
an
old
man
is
overflowing
with
honey
and
sap
The
wild
locusts
and
the
seamy
side
of
disillusionment
come
later
We
pic
nicked
on
Lemon
Hill
we
trooped
to
Strawberry
Man
sion
when
Levy
played
his
golden-toned
cornet
We
ate
catfish
and
waffles
on
the
picturesque
banks
of
Wissa
hickon
Creek
and
gorged
planked
shad
at
Gloucester
To
fish
in
the
Wissahickon
was
a
joy
with
Manayunk
across
the
ocean
The
annual
regattas
on
the
Schuylkill
were
religiously
followed
Didn
t
I
have
a
brother
a
referee
on
the

boat
or
in
the

two
brothers
in

With
what
nervous
anticipation
we
would
stand
at
the
end
of
the
course
and
watch
for
the
winner
When
the
Malta
boys
won
our
throats
automatically
released
a
yell
a
rebel
yell
at
that
The
Centennial
re
gatta
especially
appealed
to
us
for
a
home
crew
I
ve
forgotten
the
club
beat
the
British
visitors
From
Schuylkill
Falls
to
Rockland
Bridge
the
course
was
black
with
people
But
the
London
Rowing
Club
beat
Yale
by
a
second
and
there
was
gloom
in
the
camp
For
baseball
I
never
entertained
the
same
admiration
It
was
too
violent
but
I
was
mildly
interested
in
the
Red
Sox
and
similar
organisations
As
the
population
of
the
city
was
so
much
less
than
to-day
s
you
could
go
for
miles
in
the
park
and
meet
but
few
folk
Picnics
were
quite
the
thing
There
were
no
trolleys
as
the
park
was
near
and
we
usually
walked
I
notice
now
that
a
regrettable
puritanical
spirit
has
turned
this
leafy
paradise
into
a
thirsty
desert
That
s
the
way
to
do
it
Make
people
uncomfortable
Tell
them
if
they
are
thirsty
to
drink
lemonade
or
gassy
soda

Muzzle
them
with
good
advice
but
for

them
burgundy
and
terrapin
or
pretzels
and
beer
As
for
beer
poor
vulgar
despised
beverage
that
is
being
chased
off

Yet
Philadelphia
was
famous
throughout
the
world
for
its
brews
Old
Brewerytown
may
go
but
not
its
memories
There
was
a
certain
little
garden
attached
to
Conrad
s
brewery
on
West
Poplar
Street
long
since
disappeared
where
of
Sunday
afternoons
you
fancied
yourself
in
Europe
I
maintain
that
simple
pleasures
of
this
sort
react
more
favourably
on
civic
life
than
despotic
measures
You
can
t
sup
press
legitimate
thirst
but
you
can
follow
the
example
of
continental
nations
and
canalise
it
make
it
sociable
and
enjoyable
Catfish
and
waffles
without
light
wine
or
beer
is
like
Wissahickon
without
its
historical
creek
Oh
America
Happy
hunting-ground
for
humbug

and
hypocrisy
Vacations
were
sometimes
spent
at
Chestnut
Hill
at
Squan
River
or
Atlantic
City
preferably
the
latter
We
usually
victimised
our
Aunt
Eliza
who
lived
on
Atlantic
Avenue
Pacific
Avenue
was
a
mere
sketch
You
could
see
the
ocean
from
your
back
porch
on
Atlantic
Avenue
When
a
few
years
ago
I
flew
over
the
Island
in
Beryl
Kendrick
s
hydroplane
I
noted
the
changes
in
the
coast-line
The
Thoroughfare
is
hardly
the
same
Brigantine
Beach
is
slowly
being
brought
closer
by
sand
bars
But
the
boardwalk
is
unique
It
was
a
poor
affair
fifty
years
ago
for
it
is
a
half-century
since
I
climbed
the
tower
of
the
lighthouse
Cape
May
on
the
other
hand
has
changed
but
not
for
the
better
It
was
Queen
of
the
watering-places
on
this
New
Jersey
coast
when
Atlantic
City
was
a
modest
fishing
resort
However
our
favourite
playground
was
Fair-mount
Park
annihilating
all
that
s
made
to
a
green
thought
in
a
green
shade
as
old
Andrew
Marvell
sang
Young
Kendrick
fell
last
June
and
was
killed
In
a
word
life
in
Philadelphia
ran
on
oiled
wheels
Even
to-day
after
the
huge
clatter
of
New
York
and
despite
its
own
contribution
to
the
Moloch
of
Noise
there
is
something
mellow
and
human
about
the
drowsy
hum
of
Chestnut
the
genteel
reaches
of
Walnut
the
neat
frontage
of
Spruce
Streets
The
stranger
is
at
the
first
bored
then
lulled
at
last
amused
by
our
intimate
life
London
or
The
Hague
recalls
Philadelphia
to
some
of
us
The
fine
disdainful
air
of
Locust
Street
the
curi
ously
constrained
attitude
of
the
brick
houses
on
side
streets
as
if
deferentially
listening
to
the
snobbish
back
yard
remarks
of
their
statelier
neighbours
the
brown
stone
fagades
these
things
demand
the
descriptive
genius
of
a
Dickens
to
make
them
real
Dickens
who
discerned
human
expression
in
door-knockers
and
on
the
faces
of
lean
lonely
twilight-haunted
houses
The
water-fronts
fascinated
me
Port
Richmond
on
a
misty
day
would
recall
London
which
city
I
had
never
seen
but
secretly
worshipped
I
have
since
wondered
at
this
curious
mental
transposition
of
cities
and
the
sensations
aroused
by
them
particularly
the
slightly
perverse
wish
to
be
at
home
when
in
Europe
Philadelphia
never
seemed
so
desirable
as
when
I
lived
in
Paris
Nostalgia
Perhaps
But
an
absurd
one
I
longed
for
Paris
when
I
returned
to
Philadelphia
and
I
perpetually
saw
European
in
the
most
ordinary
and
domestic
things
That
way
lies
cosmopolitanism
and
cosmopolitanism
has
played
the
devil
with
my
life
making
me
a
wanderer
when
I
was
happier
at
home
making
me
think
Brussels
beer
was
ioo
STEEPLEJACK
better
than
the
brew
I
drank
at
old
Pop
Kemper
s
place
on
Sansom
Street
forcing
me
to
deny
I
blush
to
say
that
Fairmoimt
Park
was
superior
to
the
Prater
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
or
the
Thiergarten
It
is
But
an
inverted
snobbery
made
me
say
the
opposite
In
matters
spiritual
and
artistic
it
is
the
same
To
be
sure
I
never
denied
that
Mark
Twain
wasn
t
our
most
American
of
writers
one
who
would
outlive
the
pallid
philosophy
of
Emerson
the
swaggering
humbuggery
of
Walt
Whit
man
or
the
sonorous
platitudes
of
Longfellow
that
sort
of
snobbery
I
never
cultivated
I
adored
Poe
and
sadly
wonder
over
the
certain
condescension
among
our
native
critics
when
speaking
of
him
He
drank
So
did
Gen
eral
Grant
He
drugged
So
did
Coleridge
De
Quincey
and
Charles
Baudelaire
He
was
inconstant
So
were
Byron
Shelley
Swinburne
oh
billions
of
humans
what
man
some
time
or
other
hasn
t
carried
a
harem
under
his
hat
Or
dreamed
of
houris
never
seen
on
sea
or
land
But
European
poets
could
live
recklessly
while
this
un
happy
American
was
hunted
to
his
grave
for
his
tempera
mental
variations
and
once
buried
was
quickly
exhumed
by
the
moral
buzzards
As
Baudelaire
who
gave
Poe
European
fame
by
translating
him
wrote
Since
when
are
the
jackals
permitted
to
defile
the
graves
of
genius
in
the
United
States
Why
don
t
critics
and
public
alike
pose
the
important
question
Is
the
work
good
Is
the
work
bad
Do
this
and
the
moral
will
take
care
of
it
self
that
misery-breeding
moral
varying
like
a
weather
vane
according
to
clime
time
and
circumstance
But
restless
bones
and
the
fear
that
home-keeping
youths
have
homely
wits
drove
me
across
seas
and
back
again
Even
as
a
lad
when
I
stood
at
Market
Street
ferry
I
wished
to
be
in
Camden
I
would
stay
on
a
car
long
after
the
point
was
passed
where
1
should
have
alighted
These
were
only
growing
pains
I
know
yet
showed
like
straws
which
way
the
breeze
would
blow
later
on
Girls
when
maturing
sometimes
nibble
at
slate
pencils
or
sip
vinegar
this
doesn
t
impeach
them
from
becoming
the
happy
mothers
of
twins
or
joining
the
suffragette
brigade
I
remember
a
terrible
story
of
ab
normal
passion
manifested
by
an
up-State
Judge
from
Reading
or
Lancaster
or
Harrisburg
Once
a
year
he
would
disappear
and
visit
the
Quaker
city
Then
at
the
Girard
House
in
the
secrecy
of
a
locked
room
he
would
let
loose
his
worst
instinct
and
for
a
week
wallow
in
debauchery
But
here
is
the
odd
part
of
the
story
one
vouched
for
by
the
best
authority
the
man
himself
His
degrading
obsession
was
oatmeal
and
cream
Fear
ing
the
accusation
of
gluttony
in
his
native
town
he
would
come
here
and
stuff
himself
till
miserably
ill
with
oatmeal
then
pale
his
soul
at
peace
he
would
return
home
meekly
accepting
the
suspicious
glances
of
his
wife
and
the
broad
jests
of
his
friends
But
his
morbid
crav
ing
had
been
satisfied
and
without
peril
to
his
immortal
soul
besides
he
was
considered
a
slily
wicked
chap
a
deevil
amang
the
wimmen
What
man
vain
or
other
wise
could
resist
such
flattering
implications
MAGIC
A
new
mania
invaded
my
consciousness
about
this
time
and
captured
me
in
the
very
citadel
of
my
being
Magic
black
and
white
As
was
so
often
the
case
the
spark
that
set
me
afire
came
from
a
book
the
Memoirs
of
Robert
Houdin
most
amiable
of
Frenchmen
most
in
genious
of
conjurers
He
was
the
first
to
utilise
elec
tricity
as
an
aid
to
his
magical
mechanisms
he
literallj
invented
so-called
Second
Sight
and
while
his
magic
is
quite
out
of
date
he
may
be
fairly
called
the
Columbus
of
his
profession
the
modern
Columbus
because
magic
is
as
old
as
the
Atlanteans
and
every
religious
mythology
has
its
legends
of
the
art
Before
I
read
Houdin
old
Signor
Blitz
had
made
our
young
eyes
stare
with
his
tricks
and
his
ventriloquism
And
Heller
magician
and
piano
virtuoso
had
linked
in
my
imagination
the
two
arts
Heller
whose
real
name
was
Palmer
and
an
English
man
was
an
excellent
pianist
A
grand
piano
always
stood
on
the
stage
surrounded
by
his
infernal
apparatus
cones
and
cabinets
glittering
brass
and
the
complete
paraphernalia
of
the
successful
prestidigitator
Heller
played
the
operatic
fantasias
of
Thalberg
then
con
sidered
extremely
difficult
with
technical
finish
and
musical
taste
He
had
evidently
studied
in
a
good
school
and
his
touch
sang
on
the
keyboard
What
he
accom
plished
in
the
other
craft
I
have
forgotten
But
he
was
a
degree
higher
than
Signor
Blitz
Hermann
was
defter
at
card
tricks
I
mean
the
original
of
that
name
not
his
nephew
Houdin
I
missed
in
Paris
though
I
attended
a
seance
at
the
Houdin
Theatre
somewhere
down
the
grand
boulevard
and
conducted
by
his
son
Maskelyne
and
Cook
at
Egyptian
Hall
London
were
in
my
opinion
the
most
remarkable
of
all
the
illusionists
I
had
seen
and
I
saw
all
I
could
from
Blitz
and
Perry
to
Keller
and
Harry
Houdini
Exposing
the
spiritualistic
humbug
gery
was
another
sensation
of
the
day
for
after
the
toe
cracking
exploits
of
the
Fox
Sisters
of
Rochester
came
messages
red-hot
from
spirit-land
with
cabinets
and
tam
bourines
banjos
and
apparitions
Need
I
add
that
the
recent
death
of
Eusapia
Palladino
the
Italian
medium
with
the
newspaper
accounts
of
her
curious
career
only
prove
that
victims
still
abound
Think
of
such
a
great
scientist
as
Professor
Crookes
being
fooled
by
the
Katie
King
materialisation
Poor
old
Professor
Zoellner
went
mad
over
the
fourth-dimension
and
it
was
because
of
this
charlatanry
that
Pepper
invented
his
famous
ghost
We
saw
it
at
the
Academy
how
many
years
ago
and
after
that
only
imbeciles
could
be
convinced
that
me
diums
had
supernatural
communication
with
alleged
spirits
Supernormal
these
women
are
and
their
catalepsies
have
proved
of
value
to
psychiatrists
But
it
is
all
of
the
earth
earthy
Then
there
was
the
plump
nymph
who
slumbered
in
mid-air
her
elbow
resting
on
an
iron
upright
She
too
has
gone
the
way
of
things
inutile
No
one
believes
in
her
nowadays
The
crystal
clock-dial
suspended
by
a
wire
one
of
Houdin
s
inventions
was
a
novelty
in
the
seventies
But
these
elaborate
mechanisms
did
not
tease
my
fancy
as
did
the
personal
address
displayed
in
pure
sleight-of-hand
To
make
vanish
a
solid
ball
to
throw
a
pack
of
cards
in
the
air
and
with
a
magic
dagger
transfix
the
card
chosen
in
the
audience
by
a
confeder
ate
or
else
forced
to
stand
before
a
table
and
with
mystic
gabble
make
eggs
open
and
become
bouquets
or
pull
rabbits
and
water-filled
glass
globets
from
a
silk
hat
ah
how
my
heart
beat
in
the
presence
of
those
marvels
I
had
read
of
the
mango-tree
of
the
disap
pearing
rope-ladders
of
East
Indian
Yogis
yet
none
appealed
so
much
to
my
fancy
as
nimble
finger-tricks
I
became
an
adept
and
a
nuisance
to
the
family
I
would
dazzle
the
servants
by
juggling
with
apples
po
tatoes
plates
From
my
unhappy
aunt
I
would
pluck
oranges
and
finally
I
became
so
mad
over
the
thing
that
I
gave
exhibitions
in
our
nursery
to
gaping
boys
and
girls
collected
from
the
neighbourhood
admission
five
pins
per
person
These
affairs
always
broke
up
in
a
fight
free
to
all
comers
either
my
brother
Paul
would
become
a
recalcitrant
confederate
and
forget
to
return
to
its
owner
the
real
handkerchief
or
else
some
inquisi
tive
urchin
in
the
audience
would
force
his
way
behind
the
curtain
just
as
I
was
cooking
up
some
dark
enchant
ment
I
was
really
suffering
from
virtuoso
fever
the
inclination
that
drives
deluded
people
on
a
concert
plat
form
there
to
sing
or
play
and
make
a
show
of
themselves
Deeper
rooted
still
was
the
desire
to
illude
The
escape
from
the
actual
The
yearning
for
the
miracle
It
found
its
account
with
me
later
in
music
at
once
the
most
sensuous
and
spiritual
of
the
Seven
Arts
the
one
art
which
extends
partially
over
the
line
into
the
unex
plored
fourth
dimension
of
mystical
mathematics
Music
mathematics
mysticism
The
oldest
of
triune
sub
stances
Mysticism
didn
t
bother
me
as
a
boy
It
was
the
Will-to-Deceive
as
the
psychologists
would
say
that
made
its
appeal
The
Great
Adventure
then
was
to
bamboozle
my
little
public
and
to
this
very
day
I
re
tain
a
certain
finger
ability
in
palming
coins
or
hand
kerchiefs
Alas
the
vanishing
globe
full
of
gold-fish
is
beyond
my
present
capacity
but
I
can
play
in
a
re
spectable
style
HandePs
fire
fugue
and
keep
its
complex
web
of
four
voices
distinct
Music
executive
music
is
also
prestidigitation
but
allied
to
beautiful
sounding
patterns
And
music
is
an
order
of
mystic
sensuous
mathematics
as
I
wrote
in
my
study
of
Chopin
To
complete
the
ruin
of
my
regular
habits
my
prin
cipal
Professor
Roth
fetched
from
London
an
illustrated
catalogue
of
Bland
whose
magic
shop
somewhere
in
Soho
was
a
resort
of
the
profession
I
longed
for
appa
ratus
I
went
to
great
lengths
to
secure
the
coveted
articles
and
at
the
shop
of
Yost
on
Ninth
near
Arch
Street
I
met
my
Waterloo
The
proprietor
was
a
little
dark-skinned
man
whose
large
black
eyes
would
hypno
tise
you
as
he
performed
inexplicable
passes
removing
out
of
time
and
space
a
weighty
object
I
literally
sat
at
the
feet
of
this
Yost
the
Yogi
I
must
have
had
the
shining
brow
of
the
neophyte
Perry
the
magician
was
a
visitor
at
the
shop
and
could
handle
a
pack
of
cards
with
skill
I
neglected
my
books
I
was
become
a
weekly
truant
The
grand
debacle
was
at
hand
For
merly
it
had
been
Wood
s
Museum
that
deranged
my
studies
the
Lauris
Harry
Hawk
the
leading
lady
Lily
Hinton
and
the
stock
company
not
to
speak
of
old
Joe
Nagle
these
had
all
contributed
in
turn
to
divert
me
from
the
straight
and
narrow
path
of
scholarly
recti
tude
Magic
finished
me
and
there
was
irony
in
the
gift
of
Professor
Roth
for
that
Bland
catalogue
lost
him
a
pupil
After
a
brief
but
very
intense
interview
with
my
father
my
magical
toys
were
returned
to
the
original
owner
I
was
removed
from
school
an
expensive
one
by
the
way
why
waste
time
there
when
I
wouldn
t
study
I
became
an
old
man
overnight
a
senile
dotard
of
twelve
Another
dream
smashed
What
my
future
A
YOUTHFUL
MACHINIST
My
parents
were
surprised
when
I
boldly
suggested
that
I
study
to
become
a
mechanical
engineer
What
I
thought
of
in
the
recesses
of
my
idiotic
skull
was
the
realisation
of
an
old
dream
to
become
a
locomotive
engineer
and
make
daily
runs
between
the
depot
at
Ninth
and
Green
Streets
and
Chestnut
Hill
Had
I
not
been
found
by
an
agonised
nurse
beneath
a
locomo
tive
at
Chestnut
Hill
picking
the
cylinder
Had
I
not
pushed
the
controlling
lever
of
a
machine
and
set
it
spinning
down
the
steel
grooves
through
the
narrow
cut
below
the
Hill
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
fireman
the
engineer
had
gone
away
in
the
coal
tender
I
should
have
come
to
grief
as
I
couldn
t
stop
the
locomotive
My
bias
towards
machinery
was
unquestionable
At
last
my
vocation
Finally
yielding
it
was
decided
that
I
should
learn
the
trade
from
cellar
to
garret
and
to
that
end
I
was
apprenticed
to
the
Baldwin
Locomotive
Works
before
the
steam-hammer
shop
of
which
I
had
so
many
times
been
ravished
by
the
spectacle
of
sooty
giants
flying
sparks
the
clash
of
metal
and
the
fierce
blaze
of
the
furnaces
I
was
suddenly
lifted
from
the
ditch
of
depression
I
forgot
my
magic
and
only
had
a
vision
of
that
locomotive
test
its
wheels
a
few
feet
off
the
ground
revolving
at
a
superhuman
speed
amid
the
hissing
of
steam
and
the
anxiety
of
the
judges
above
in
the
cab
My
ultimate
goal
was
s
the
job
as
engineer
on
the
railroad
Other
boys
longed
to
be
policemen
or
sol
io8
STEEPLEJACK
diers
or
engineers
and
I
recall
one
queer
little
chap
who
confessed
that
he
wished
he
had
been
born
a
girl
how
we
hooted
him
one
afternoon
for
this
admission
the
brevet
in
our
eyes
of
a
coward
But
a
locomotive
and
fifty
miles
an
hour
for
me
To-day
I
hate
motor-cars
speed
dusty
roads
and
the
honk
of
the
horns
Why
The
great
day
came
and
early
one
sultry
September
went
in
company
with
my
patient
father
to
the
works
to
the
machine-shop
at
the
corner
of
Seventeenth
and
a
little
street
I
have
forgotten
isn
t
it
Hamilton
There
we
met
William
Parry
a
member
of
the
firm
and
whose
family
had
intermarried
with
a
cousin
of
ours
a
Baird
Mr
Parry
had
been
a
workman
and
was
the
most
active
and
practical
of
the
great
Baldwin-Baird
corporation
He
was
amiable
to
me
and
seemed
to
think
it
natural
that
I
should
yearn
to
become
an
engineer
We
entered
a
vast
gloomy
shop
The
noise
deafened
me
Men
half-naked
hammered
on
anvils
machinery
spun
around
the
place
was
damp
and
smelled
of
smoke
A
thin
stooped
man
in
middle
years
and
wearing
spectacles
saluted
my
father
Hello
John
and
my
father
an
swered
Hello
Pete
I
was
told
that
he
was
Peter
Farnum
an
old
Northern
Liberty
friend
of
his
He
was
a
kind
man
but
oh
my
his
face
and
bare
arms
were
greasy
The
idea
of
physical
impurity
had
always
re
volted
me
I
was
soon
to
shed
such
girl-like
nonsense
After
Mr
Parry
had
said
a
few
words
to
Mr
Farnum
he
shook
our
hands
saying
We
ll
make
a
man
of
your
boy
John
and
left
us
His
departure
was
as
if
the
sun
had
hid
behind
a
cloud
With
my
father
he
was
one
of
the
last
links
with
the
outside
world
Already
I
was
repenting
of
my
determination
to
become
an
engineer
already
I
suffered
from
homesickness
The
practical
Farnum
told
me
to
come
next
morning
ten
minutes
be
fore
seven
and
bring
a
pair
of
jumpers
overalls
he
called
them
then
he
would
set
me
to
work
I
arose
at
five
A
M
the
following
day
and
ate
breakfast
with
my
father
who
as
an
old
workman
had
never
cured
himself
of
his
early-rising
neurosis
I
ate
a
rare
beefsteak
so
as
to
put
hair
on
my
chest
as
my
father
realistically
phrased
it
Then
a
bundle
under
my
arm
a
full
dinner-pail
in
the
other
hand
cap
on
head
and
my
heart
a
cinder
in
my
bosom
I
walked
down
the
street
in
a
hazy
dawn
and
reached
the
shop
a
half-hour
too
soon
But
the
men
began
to
straggle
in
coughing
grunting
some
smoking
pipes
all
wearing
the
resigned
yet
resentful
expression
of
humans
about
to
begin
another
day
of
hateful
slavery
Talk
about
the
dignity
of
labour
to
working
men
and
watch
their
incredulous
sneers
Dignity
be
hanged
they
used
to
say
to
me
at
the
dinner-hour
it
s
the
grind
ing
misery
of
long
hours
ten
hours
in
those
times
the
poor
pay
and
the
risks
of
the
job
and
after
my
short
experience
I
heartily
agree
with
their
views
and
I
m
neither
a
socialist
nor
an
anarchist
much
less
a
senti
mental
agitator
parlour
rebel
nor
amateur
busybody
fomenting
trouble
among
the
proletariat
to
whom
the
world
will
presently
belong
the
bourgeois
having
had
his
fling
since
Napoleon
I
But
I
have
lived
with
these
men
seen
their
futile
attempts
to
make
both
ends
meet
to
avoid
the
temptations
of
drink
good-fellowship
and
the
natural
desire
for
a
little
relaxation
after
so
many
hours
of
blinding
toil
To-day
steel-workers
occasion

as
multi-millionaires
Wages

Nevertheless

STEEPLEJACK
Since
my
experience
at
the
Baldwin
shops
I
have
seen
the
coal-miners
of
Belgium
in
the
black
lands
and
look
back
at
Baldwin
s
as
an
earthly
paradise
in
com
parison
Whenever
anyone
tells
me
that
we
should
all
remain
in
the
position
God
placed
us
I
wonder
what
this
particular
moralist
would
say
if
he
found
himself
in
the
cold
dawn
of
a
drizzling
autumn
morning
ham
mering
screws
amidst
a
hell
of
fire
fury
and
noise
or
in
a
boiler-shop
chipping
with
a
chisel
It
s
no
fun
hard
work
and
as
I
was
born
constitutionally
lazy
I
loathe
it
To
be
driven
like
stupid
sheep
or
angry
goats
into
an
enclosure
and
there
work
or
starve
ha
just
try
it
once
yourself
Mr
Universal
Panacea
I
know
that
the
labour
party
makes
mistakes
that
it
is
as
tyrannical
in
its
essence
as
trust
combinations
mo
nopolies
and
other
oppressive
institutions
yet
I
can
t
help
sympathising
with
the
workman
and
that
much
I
learned
from
hard
experience
something
my
kind
father
never
allowed
me
to
see
at
home
No
wonder
Later
I
read
Proudhon
Marx
Lassalle
Stirner
and
Mackay
to
find
the
same
arguments
But
I
had
only
set
foot
on
the
first
rung
of
the
lad
der
of
torture
Pete
Farnum
showed
where
I
could
stow
my
kit
a
locker
with
a
key
which
he
bade
me
use
if
I
expected
to
keep
intact
my
copious
luncheon
of
cold
meat
and
buttered
bread
Workmen
are
as
honest
as
any
other
class
but
borrowed
food
doesn
t
come
under
any
rubric
of
the
decalogue
I
put
on
my
new
and
coarse
overalls
too
large
by
half
for
me
I
stood
waiting
for
further
orders
a
picture
of
scared
sickly
youth
How
I
wished
myself
out
of
it
all
Then
there
surged
into
my
view
another
face
It
belonged
to
Woody
Menden
hall
the
superintendent
a
small
wiry
terribly
active
A
YOUTHFUL
MACHINIST
m
man
with
blond
hair
and
an
imperious
way
with
him
that
sent
my
heart
into
my
boots
The
boss
But
he
proved
a
pleasant
boss
only
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
and
his
oaths
were
so
crisply
blurted
out
that
I
feared
him
He
told
Mr
Farnum
to
send
me
out
into
the
yard
to
get
the
pedestals
that
support
the
piston-box
of
the
locomotive
Each
shop
in
this
enormous
hive
has
its
particular
part
of
the
machine
to
produce
and
perfect
In
our
shop
it
was
the
cylinders
My
initial
task
was
to
knock
off
with
a
hammer
and
a
chisel
the
roughness
of
the
casting
on
the
pedestals
rust
and
bubbles
were
thus
removed
But
first
I
had
to
get
my
pedestals
They
lay
in
the
yard
and
after
a
snow
it
wasn
t
pleasant
to
dig
them
up
Then
lugging
the
ugly
casting
into
the
shop
I
would
put
it
in
a
vise
at
my
work-bench
and
pro
ceed
to
maul
my
thumb
with
a
twelve-pound
steel
ham
mer
How
heavy
it
was
I
discovered
that
technique
is
demanded
in
such
a
prosaic
occupation
as
hitting
a
chisel
squarely
on
the
head
A
light
elastic
wrist
econ
omy
of
movement
a
shrewd
eye
and
bang
Again
on
the
first
knuckle
of
my
right-hand
thumb
How
ever
practice
improved
my
stroke
its
speed
and
preci
sion
and
after
a
week
I
began
to
touch
the
chisel
But
my
colleagues
otherwise
the
gang
wouldn
t
let
me
alone
I
was
called
the
dude
because
there
was
a
rumour
that
Mr
Parry
a
boss
among
bosses
had
me
under
his
wing
then
too
Pete
Farnum
was
nice
to
me
worst
of
all
my
white
hands
and
slender
fingers
damned
me
in
the
eyes
of
my
new
acquaintances
I
think
I
might
have
been
forgiven
my
pull
but
that
my
hands
were
against
me
skinny
fingers
as
one
fellow
derisively
said
fingers
that
never
did
never
would
do
a
day
s
hard
work
He
wasn
t
a
bad
prophet
this
same
Harry
whose
family
name
I
shall
never
know
The
work
was
hard
the
workmen
not
sympathetic
But
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
came
pay-day
that
magical
word
which
sesame-like
opens
all
doors
I
had
rather
swaggered
at
home
patronising
my
younger
brother
and
forcing
the
proletarian
note
especially
rejoicing
in
my
grimy
personal
condition
I
believed
it
the
real
thing
to
appear
as
dirty
as
I
could
I
even
went
so
far
as
to
smear
my
self
with
soot
and
grease
It
seemed
quite
in
the
key
of
the
toiler
with
his
hands
But
that
pay
envelope
That
settled
my
social
status
It
was
my
first
attack
on
capitalistic
reserves
I
was
earning
my
living
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
and
the
sum
was
precisely
five
dollars
and
twenty-five
cents
piece-work
I
wasn
t
appren
ticed
as
I
had
expected
The
system
of
apprenticeship
was
no
longer
in
vogue
at
Baldwin
s
My
wages
looked
large
in
my
eyes
for
they
were
all
mine
However
I
didn
t
buy
a
private
yacht
at
once
though
I
cast
eyes
on
a
small
sailboat
for
sale
second-hand
As
soon
as
I
manifested
a
friendly
disposition
my
mates
returned
it
with
interest
They
were
decent
chaps
few
dissipated
and
admirers
of
men
like
William
Parry
Peter
Farnum
and
Woody
Mendenhall
who
had
once
worked
with
their
hands
When
they
learned
that
my
father
too
had
used
his
hands
to
earn
his
daily
bread
their
respect
for
me
was
not
decreased
I
told
them
that
my
grandfather
worked
with
his
hands
but
pressing
down
organ
keys
didn
t
impress
them
as
genuine
labour
It
was
playing
Their
fetish
was
the
human
hand
the
true
tool
of
humanity
And
they
were
right
Carlyle
couldn
t
have
put
the
case
more
clearly
than
Andy
a
Scotchman
with
whom
I
chummed
Ye
see
lad
it
s
this
way
If
ye
don
t
use
your
hands
to
earn
your
bread
you
re
a
softy
No
good
You
re
living
off
the
working
man
You
re
an
aristocrat
That
s
my
belief
Otherwise
Andy
was
not
very
radical
He
read
Hugh
Miller
s
Old
Red
Sandstone
after
luncheon
and
hummed
hymn-tunes
From
him
I
learned
to
re
spect
the
hand
as
the
mightiest
lever
of
civilisation
My
own
hands
were
the
dirtiest
in
the
shop
and
I
gloried
in
them
Besides
Andy
who
was
tall
thin
dark
there
was
another
chum
Tommy
and
as
we
became
insep
arable
we
were
usually
saluted
in
mock
Scotch
dialect
Wha
s
cooming
the
noo
Tommy
Jemmy
Andy
Tommy
was
a
reddish
blond
Englishman
with
a
broad
Northumberland
brogue
I
knew
it
was
Northumber
land
accent
because
he
told
me
so
He
was
a
steady
worker
his
leisure
hours
he
spent
with
his
books
On
clear
Sundays
he
took
fatiguingly
long
walks
with
Andy
I
accompanied
them
only
once
that
sufficed
He
held
that
the
American
workman
would
be
fresher
if
he
walked
more
he
hated
saloons
and
was
a
teetotaller
but
not
rabid
when
it
came
to
another
man
s
drinking
Live
and
let
live
was
his
motto
though
I
did
hear
him
giving
Andy
a
blowing
up
on
Blue
Mondays
Andy
liked
his
little
drink
and
on
Sundays
it
was
always
a
large
one
But
he
never
missed
a
day
at
his
job
My
dinner-pail
was
an
object
of
much
curiosity
When
my
mates
saw
it
the
first
day
they
gasped
Our
cook
who
spoiled
me
from
my
birth
would
fill
it
with
several
pounds
of
cold
meat
and
other
items
in
propor
tion
There
was
enough
to
satisfy
the
stomachs
of
two
hungry
men
I
look
back
with
envy
on
my
assumed
capacity
for
I
never
finished
the
portions
My
friends
helped
me
and
would
then
stare
at
me
as
if
I
were
prize-cattle
The
appellation
of
hollow-legs
pursued
me
from
my
father
s
dining-table
to
my
humble
work
bench
I
was
positively
embarrassed
by
the
rough
good-humoured
remarks
passed
on
my
appetite
I
ap
preciated
David
Copperfield
s
feelings
after
his
encoun
ter
with
the
ferocious
waiter
at
the
inn
and
the
land
lady
s
obvious
worriment
when
she
whispered
to
the
coachmen
Take
care
of
that
boy
George
he
is
wisibly
swelling
I
quote
from
memory
As
cold
food
didn
t
agree
with
me
I
ate
a
hot
dinner
in
company
with
Tommy
and
Andy
at
a
boarding-house
somewhere
on
Hamilton
Street
The
change
and
the
fresh
air
were
tonics
I
consumed
more
than
ever
In
the
meantime
my
pay-envelope
did
not
grow
I
have
since
consoled
myself
with
the
knowledge
that
I
earned
more
as
a
me
chanic
than
I
did
at
any
time
later
when
engaged
in
the
practice
of
the
law
or
conveyancing
But
my
hour
was
at
hand
I
was
about
to
come
to
grips
with
a
superior
force
Our
shop
was
full
of
whirl
ing
monsters
that
from
time
to
time
would
seize
a
man
and
tear
him
to
pieces
There
was
an
organised
hos
pital
service
in
the
establishment
not
to
speak
of
acci
dent-insurance
for
the
employes
I
had
been
warned
from
the
beginning
to
avoid
the
drills
lathes
and
other
scoopers
of
lives
My
jumper
was
too
full
in
the
sleeves
Tommy
begged
me
to
have
them
altered
I
promised
this
The
holidays
were
at
hand
Night
work
gave
me
a
chance
to
earn
some
extra
money
I
was
running
a
drill-press
by
this
time
that
is
I
bored
screw
holes
in
an
iron
beam
for
the
pedestals
aforesaid
It
was
a
job
that
needed
no
particular
skill
or
judgment
The
spot
for
the
hole
was
indicated
by
a
chalk
mark
I
enjoyed
the
play
of
the
machine
and
was
fairly
industrious
until
one
unlucky
December
night
I
turned
to
answer
a
neigh
bour
when
bang
I
felt
my
sleeve
caught
in
the
rapidly
revolving
drill
and
the
room
machines
and
men
turned
around
me
as
in
a
dream
I
cried
out
but
couldn
t
hear
my
voice
and
then
my
head
was
knocked
against
the
iron
table
I
heard
music
singing
in
my
ears
and
went
to
sleep
without
pain
It
was
a
pleasant
death
When
I
came
to
myself
the
voice
of
the
sardonic
Harry
fell
on
my
ears
and
it
smarted
more
than
the
balsam
apple
which
they
poured
over
my
skinned
arms
and
chest
He
swung
around
the
circle
like
General
Grant
It
must
have
been
the
time
of
General
Grant
s
world
tour
as
the
expression
swinging
around
the
circle
was
in
everyone
s
mouth
But
it
did
seem
cruelly
in
appropriate
Andy
had
proved
my
saviour
with
the
quickly
operating
wits
of
a
practical
workman
he
didn
t
seek
to
drag
me
from
the
dangerous
drill
but
simply
pushed
the
belting
off
the
lower
wheel
the
machine
came
to
a
standstill
and
I
fell
to
the
floor
All
the
same
it
was
a
narrow
squeak
There
was
a
compensation
Emerson
insists
that
always
there
is
one
In
this
instance
it
proved
to
be
the
official
ambulance
with
a
driver
a
surgeon
red
lights
and
a
gong
My
mother
s
feelings
may
be
imagined
when
this
terrifying
apparatus
halted
at
our
house
and
good-hearted
Peter
Farnum
went
in
to
break
the
news
I
can
see
my
mother
white-faced
but
cool
helping
me
up-stairs
I
wasn
t
much
damaged
Skinned
alive
was
the
sensation
yet
no
bones
were
broken
and
my
case
was
considered
a
mere
accident
compared
with
the
swift
horrid
entanglements
of
unhappy
men
in
a
belt
there
to
be
dragged
to
the
ceiling
and
mangled
How
ever
I
had
become
a
hero
without
heroism
I
hadn
t
cried
though
there
were
tears
of
agony
in
my
eyes
when
that
infernal
juice
of
the
balsam
apple
was
sprinkled
over
my
raw
flesh
Even
the
nervous
shock
failed
to
register
I
was
of
tougher
material
than
anyone
sus
pected
for
I
had
always
played
on
the
belief
of
my
mother
that
I
was
delicate
because
of
premature
birth
My
nurse
had
predicted
that
seventh-month
children
never
came
to
maturity
Therefore
my
speedy
return
to
normal
health
surprised
My
mother
kept
the
hand
ful
of
rags
that
had
been
torn
and
twisted
by
the
drill
I
signified
my
intention
of
returning
to
the
shop
I
suspect
it
was
more
from
a
spirit
of
bragging
than
any
love
of
the
job
Of
machinery
I
had
my
bellyful
But
I
wanted
to
go
back
and
back
to
Baldwin
s
I
went
There
were
Tommy
and
Andy
to
see
and
there
was
Boss
Farnum
to
thank
for
his
kindness
I
was
called
General
Grant
by
Harry
who
didn
t
like
me
and
re
ceived
with
mild
wonder
by
my
two
chums
who
said
they
had
given
me
up
they
praised
my
pluck
but
ad
vised
me
to
get
a
lighter
job
You
will
never
make
a
workman
Jemmy
added
Tommy
Thenceforth
I
trans
ferred
my
friendship
to
an
engineer
in
the
big
boiler-room
on
the
Eighteenth
Street
side
With
him
I
shared
my
copious
dinners
and
was
rewarded
by
a
chain
of
scalp
freezing
stories
He
told
me
that
one
day
when
he
had
run
out
for
a
wet
of
ale
he
had
forgotten
the
water-cock
and
the
boilers
ran
low
On
his
return
he
was
aghast
u
The
boilers
were
foaming
my
boy
Foaming
All
was
lost
I
expected
a
blow-up
every
second
I
had
turned
on
the
water
but
it
was
too
late
Breathlessly
I
exclaimed
Did
she
blow
up
Every
machinist
knows
a
boiler
is
female
No
she
didn
t
but
it
was
a
close
call
he
grumblingly
acquiesced
I
ran
out
and
shouted
to
the
shop
that
she
was
foaming
That
foaming
caught
my
fancy
as
much
as
Mrs
Joe
Gar
gery
and
her
rampages
Despite
my
good
intentions
with
which
to
pave
Hades
nature
intervened
A
bone-breaking
cold
kept
me
in
bed
for
a
week
and
the
New
Year
found
me
tired
of
the
glittering
mirage
of
locomotive
engineer
This
time
my
father
had
something
to
say
He
had
observed
my
reading
and
scribbling
also
my
too
glib
tongue
and
a
marked
capacity
for
idling
and
naturally
enough
he
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
I
would
make
a
lawyer
I
have
read
elsewhere
that
early
in
life
I
had
my
con
science
extracted
by
a
psychical
surgeon
perhaps
my
father
thought
of
this
too
anyhow
I
said
farewell
to
Baldwin
s
which
had
done
me
some
good
early
hours
hard
work
and
the
association
with
what
Walt
Whit
man
calls
Powerful
uneducated
persons
I
found
in
them
as
I
still
find
more
strength
of
character
less
in
sipidity
and
sincerer
traits
among
workmen
than
I
do
in
other
strata
of
social
life
And
also
a
solid
education
the
education
of
life
not
books
Having
little
time
a
serious
workman
only
reads
the
best
Without
effusion
my
old
comrades
wished
me
well
Harry
I
didn
t
see
but
Tommy
and
Andy
I
hated
to
leave
I
promised
to
visit
them
every
Sunday
and
never
did
I
was
become
an
idler
with
clean
hands
a
dude
living
on
other
men
s
labour
I
knew
that
Tommy
and
Andy
had
disowned
me
so
I
promptly
forgot
them
LAW
MY
NEW
MISTRESS
My
superficial
education
soon
betrayed
itself
No
arithmetic
little
writing
less
grammar
and
a
plentiful
lack
of
history
would
these
deficiencies
bar
me
from
the
study
of
the
law
My
Latin
and
French
said
my
father
might
be
of
use
My
mother
was
sceptical
So
was
I
However
on
a
cold
cloudy
Monday
January
13
Dr
Ellwood
Wilson
who
had
brought
most
of
the
family
into
the
world
had
a
son
a
promising
young
lawyer
Ellwood
Wilson
Jr
His
offices
and
residence
were
at
No
1
1
12
Walnut
Street
The
house
a
double
one
is
intact
to-day
Across
the
street
was
the
home
of
old
Dr
Gross
and
many
a
time
I
saw
young
Haller
Gross
come
down
the
steps
in
gorgeous
raiment
for
he
was
as
great
a
dandy
then
as
Fred
Fotterall
Dick
Townsend
Ned
Rogers
Louis
Beylard
John
King
or
any
of
the
Philadelphia
Club
and
City
Troop
men
Mr
Wilson
consented
to
take
me
as
a
law
student
although
I
said
nothing
that
would
indicate
even
a
fairly
reasonable
desire
to
study
I
simply
did
as
I
was
told
My
ad
venture
as
an
engineer
in
quest
of
a
locomotive
had
left
me
rather
shame-faced
The
daily
life
of
a
law
student
was
apparently
a
lazy
one
There
was
no
salary
attached
hence
I
didn
t
kill
myself
Mr
Wilson
was
amiability
personified
We
began
with
Blackstone
Justice
Shars
wood
s
Commentaries
Dry
reading
I
didn
t
find
the
work
dry
as
its
English
was
an
antidote
for
the
inevi
table
barrenness
of
the
theme
The
intricacies
of
com
mon
law
were
disclosed
and
explained
What
racy
old
English
wrote
the
worthy
Blackstone
In
my
father
s
engraving
cabinet
there
was
an
engraved
portrait
of
the
great
man
robes
and
all
Yet
I
invariably
deserted
him
for
Wharton
and
Stille
s
Medical
Jurisprudence
There
was
metal
more
attractive
The
horrors
of
crim
inology
had
never
been
set
down
so
attractively
since
I
had
devoured
Eugene
Sue
s
Mysteries
of
Paris
Natur
ally
I
didn
t
make
perceptible
progress
in
the
law
I
absorbed
the
curriculum
as
a
sponge
absorbs
liquid
My
preceptor
examined
me
at
intervals
and
it
was
then
I
first
noted
what
I
call
my
mechanical
memory
I
memorised
as
would
a
parrot
I
repeated
pages
without
knowing
their
meaning
The
big
technical
phrases
I
gobetted
as
a
dog
does
a
bone
Terminology
of
any
sort
always
appealed
to
me
I
became
proficient
in
phrases
With
medical
or
scientific
terminology
it
is
the
same
whether
anatomy
geology
astronomy
or
cookery
the
technical
verbalisms
were
easy
to
remember
My
judg
ment
centres
were
not
much
exercised
so
that
when
I
underwent
regulation
examinations
at
the
Law
School
or
during
the
law
course
at
the
University
I
had
no
trouble
in
reeling
off
page
after
page
because
I
simply
let
my
memory
prompt
and
turn
over
in
my
mind
each
page
as
it
was
finished
But
put
me
to
writing
out
opin
ions
on
a
possible
case
and
my
vaunted
memory
col
lapsed
Not
taking
the
slightest
interest
necessarily
I
had
nothing
to
say
Later
in
life
I
met
pianists
who
could
play
hundreds
of
pieces
I
have
questioned
them
and
in
nine
instances
out
of
ten
I
found
the
same
me
chanical
memory
as
mine
They
saw
the
note-groups
and
the
pages
but
the
musical
idea
or
its
emotional
ex
pression
did
not
much
concern
them
Ideas
were
then
not
my
shibboleth
I
soon
hated
the
law
as
only
rep
resenting
conventional
usage
and
musty
precedent
filled
me
with
disgust
I
had
no
need
of
reading
the
diction
ary
the
writer
s
keyboard
for
the
reason
urged
by
Theophile
Gautier
to
increase
one
s
vocabulary
I
rather
studied
it
for
Walter
Pater
s
reason
to
know
what
words
to
avoid
So
is
it
in
music
The
supreme
virtuoso
conquers
because
he
understands
and
feels
His
memory
is
filled
by
the
larger
designs
the
greater
emotional
curves
of
a
composition
and
not
merely
by
a
succession
of
notes
But
this
obvious
truth
I
was
to
discover
years
afterwards
I
loafed
and
invited
my
soul
to
reading
and
staring
from
the
large
window
on
the
north
side
of
the
house
I
became
acquainted
with
the
green
bags
of
legal
lumi
naries
I
knew
them
all
by
name
and
fame
I
saw
Richard
McMurtrie
go
quietly
by
in
earnest
converse
or
Daniel
Dougherty
a
household
name
and
friend
of
my
parents
with
his
characteristic
stride
and
flowing
locks
Richard
Dale
then
a
student
at
the
Law
School
would
wave
his
hand
and
swing
on
as
if
the
universe
depended
on
his
getting
to
Washington
Square
before
would
pass
or
old
Judge
Sharswood
would
move
along
preoccupied
with
his
eternal
legal
problems
Is
there
anything
under
the
stars
more
sterile
than
the
law
Rabelais
doesn
t
exaggerate
But
my
chief
delight
was
to
watch
G
Heide
Norris
march
by
in
all
the
splendour
of
very
very
baggy
trousers
and
very
very
high
collars
accompanied
by
a
friendly
male
echo
likewise
attired
From
Mr
Norris
I
imbibed
a
passion
for
expensive
col
lars
As
with
Victor
Maurel
the
collar
became
a
cult
At
1
1
o
clock
rain
or
shine
the
British
consul
Mr
Kortright
would
heave
into
view
portly
choleric
pink-skinned
eyes
of
porcelain-china
blue
and
dressed
as
if
for
Pall
Mall
this
pleasant
old
gentleman
was
tre
mendously
admired
by
me
If
I
saw
Dickens
types
everywhere
in
Mr
Kortright
I
found
the
ideal
Thack
eray
clubman
It
was
what
Henry
James
calls
the
emotion
of
recognition
and
the
exercise
of
this
emotion
became
an
overmastering
one
It
was
that
memory
of
mine
beginning
to
seek
analogies
I
hadn
t
then
read
Hegel
but
when
I
did
his
identification
of
opposites
was
an
easy
metaphysical
morsel
to
swallow
I
was
always
matching
patterns
men
women
ideas
sounds
sights
and
smells
Mr
Wilson
possessed
an
excellent
library
and
while
I
neglected
Somebody
or
other
on
Contracts
Kent
s
Commentaries
or
Coke
on
Littleton
I
read
De
Foe
Smollett
Richardson
Fielding
Ah
what
bliss
Cla
rissa
Harlowe
I
mixed
up
with
Tom
Jones
and
mistook
Mrs
Booth
for
Roxana
Launcelot
Greaves
and
the
Knight
of
the
Burning
Pestle
were
the
same
and
I
en
joyed
Moll
Singleton
more
than
I
did
Robinson
Crusoe
I
had
outlived
my
dime-novel
and
Jack
Harkaway
days
though
I
confess
when
the
author
of
that
famous
series
for
boys
Bracebridge
Hemynge
visited
America
I
went
to
see
him
with
more
pleasure
than
I
experienced
when
I
squeezed
the
chilly
hand
of
Matthew
Arnold
in
Asso
ciation
Hall
some
years
later
My
reading
was
not
con
fined
to
English
French
had
been
a
master
passion
all
things
French
painting
sculpture
and
literature
Horizons
widened
The
world
was
not
contained
in
Philadelphia
With
the
Centennial
Exposition
I
suf
fered
my
first
severe
attack
of
cosmopolitanism
That
tropical
summer
of
1876
shall
I
ever
forget
it
The
heat
was
so
sustained
and
exhausting
that
I
did
not
visit
the
exhibition
grounds
till
the
autumn
The
city
was
gay
Jacques
Offenbach
conducted
at
his
garden
Broad
and
Cherry
Streets
Theodore
Thomas
gave
open
air
concerts
in
the
old
Forrest
mansion
The
streets
were
tinted
by
a
hundred
exotic
costumes
and
Finelli
fried
his
oysters
in
oil
Our
town
was
put
on
the
map
of
Cosmopolis
overnight
General
Grant
had
started
the
machinery
on
the
opening
day
he
was
feeble
on
that
occasion
and
had
to
be
supported
and
half
the
world
closed
it
I
heard
Richard
Wagner
s
five
thousand
dollar
Centennial
March
played
by
the
Thomas
Or
chestra
and
wondered
how
so
much
money
could
have
been
wasted
on
such
commonplace
music
But
the
Baireuth
Music
Festival
was
in
progress
and
I
eagerly
read
the
account
in
the
Times
Wagner
was
still
a
dark
horse
his
theories
those
of
a
madman
his
music
un
melodious
Think
of
it
And
Tristran
and
Isolde
one
prolonged
melody
from
the
prelude
to
the
death-song
My
interest
in
the
law
languished
I
was
otherwise
occupied
The
4th
of
July
1876
was
not
only
the
most
memorable
day
in
the
century
but
also
the
hottest
In
a
temperature
of
105
degrees
in
my
bedroom
under
the
roof
I
wrote
a
short
story
The
Comet
and
I
don
t
doubt
that
the
temperature
stimulated
me
to
lurid
de
scription
It
was
my
first
fiction
A
comet
visits
our
planetary
system
and
with
dire
results
Poe
wrote
in
a
more
exalted
vein
his
Colloquy
of
Monos
and
Una
and
Jules
Verne
was
at
his
best
in
his
Off
on
a
Comet
I
had
the
temerity
to
sell
my
story
for
five
dollars
and
it
duly
appeared
ten
years
later
in
a
West
Philadelphia
journal
The
Telephone
I
have
it
in
my
desk
with
other
disjecta
membra
When
The
Star
by
Herbert
Wells
appeared
I
realised
how
clumsy
was
my
pitiable
inven
tion
The
English
author
puts
Poe
and
Verne
in
the
shade
with
The
Star
the
supreme
cosmical
tale
But
anyone
who
could
write
fiction
on
a
day
when
the
hinges
of
the
nethermost
abode
were
singed
had
the
call
of
the
inkpot
I
hadn
t
I
disliked
writing
principally
be
cause
of
the
pothooks
and
hangers
involved
Invention
least
of
all
troubled
me
My
handwriting
had
become
standardised
I
indited
leases
wills
and
engrossed
mortgages
and
real-estate
deeds
Mr
Wilson
was
a
notary
public
and
conveyancer
and
the
old-fashioned
methods
of
searching
for
clear
titles
in
the
Recorder
of
Deeds
office
prevailed
I
had
lots
of
fun
in
the
Re
corder
s
office
over
which
presided
a
jolly
stout
gentle
man
named
F
Theodore
Walton
His
son
lovingly
known
as
Pud
Walton
belonged
to
our
gang
of
young
sters
lawyers
en
herbe
and
statesmen
in
embryo
Many
mornings
I
spent
over
big
leather-bound
tomes
bearing
the
cryptic
letters
F
T
W
F
Theodore
Wal
ton
s
initials
Now
a
title
insurance
gives
you
a
title
while
you
wait
This
shoe-black
part
of
the
profession
as
we
called
it
no
longer
exists
I
grew
accustomed
to
the
smell
of
parchment
and
carried
a
green
baize
bag
full
of
sandwiches
and
fruit
It
looked
so
professional
Occasionally
not
often
I
was
admitted
within
the
charmed
circle
of
a
court-room
and
watched
the
legal
wheels
go
round
Years
before
I
saw
Twitchell
the
murderer
at
the
bar
and
also
Probst
a
farm-hand
who
had
slaughtered
an
entire
family
of
nine
or
ten
The
Police
Gazette
was
proscribed
read
ing
but
we
contrived
to
see
it
I
remember
Bill
Mann
the
public
prosecutor
also
General
Charles
H
T
CoIIis
I
became
familiar
with
the
procedure
of
gen
ral
practice
I
asked
Judges
for
a
delay
and
my
voice
buzzed
and
thundered
in
my
ears
My
prime
achieve
ment
was
the
day
of
the
great
Jay
Cooke
failure
when
apparently
the
heavens
of
finance
were
tumbling
into
the
Delaware
River
Ellwood
Wilson
Jr
contrary
to
the
advice
of
his
associates
precipitated
that
historical
bankruptcy
by
setting
off
a
tiny
squib
A
town
and
building
association
of
which
he
was
part
parent
had
deposited
its
entire
funds
with
Jay
Cooke
and
Company
This
was
during
the
year
1873
f
I
am
no
t
mistaken
Armed
with
a
subpoena
I
boldly
entered
the
office
of
Pitt
Cooke
a
brother
of
Jay
and
presented
him
with
a
summons
to
show
why
the
five
hundred
dollars
of
the
Freehold
Mutual
Company
or
some
such
title
should
not
be
returned
to
that
important
corporation
I
was
told
that
this
subpoena
set
off
the
mine
that
blew
up
the
banking
house
of
Jay
Cooke
and
Company
How
true
this
is
I
can
t
say
I
only
know
that
I
was
scared
blue
and
shivered
in
my
skin
even
when
the
dignified
banker
thanked
me
as
he
accepted
service
But
I
felt
myself
the
guilty
one
not
he
Mr
Wilson
s
associate
was
Henry
Galbraith
Ward
a
handsome
young
lawyer
from
New
York
where
he
is
to-day
on
the
bench
of
the
Supreme
Court
Appellate
Division
Judge
Ward
took
me
in
hand
at
once
Daily
he
put
me
through
my
paces
and
my
sleight-of-hand
memory
didn
t
deceive
him
He
would
say
Define
and
I
was
forced
to
define
or
be
sent
back
to
the
neglected
page
I
realise
now
he
was
studying
me
He
was
the
willing
recipient
of
my
half-baked
enthusiasms
and
one
day
he
advised
me
to
become
a
musician
But
steady
piano
practice
was
abhorrent
to
me
Yes
dazzle
an
audience
but
to
prepare
for
that
pleasing
event
ah
the
shoe
pinched
too
hard
And
then
a
new
crisis
had
declared
itself
fine
clothes
What
Carlyle
called
the
dandiacal
spirit
inflamed
my
very
bones
Those
pernicious
collars
of
Heide
Norris
had
undermined
my
Spartan
soul
I
became
a
dandy
No
pattern
in
colour
or
design
could
be
exaggerated
enough
Finally
one
morning
when
I
appeared
in
a
snuff-coloured
suit
baggy
as
to
trousers
and
preposterously
cut
away
in
the
coat
Mr
Ward
spoke
to
me
paternally
I
don
t
think
he
was
more
than
twenty-two
years
old
He
argued
the
case
of
taste
vs
tastelessness
Clothes
like
manners
should
be
unobtrusive
It
was
Walter
Pater
s
tact
of
omis
sion
in
the
concrete
a
phrase
by
the
way
that
Oscar
Wilde
calmly
appropriated
I
listened
and
my
mood
was
chastened
I
have
often
thought
of
Judge
Henry
Galbraith
Ward
when
I
revelled
in
a
purple
prose-panel
My
temperament
has
always
inclined
to
the
excessive
the
full-blown
the
flamboyant
That
clothes
crisis
is
common
to
hobbydehoys
I
was
infatuated
with
Ouida
the
heavy
swells
in
Punch
Anthony
TroIIope
filled
me
with
pangs
of
envy
His
longest
novel
The
Way
We
Live
Now
and
the
young
aristocrats
of
the
Bear
Garden
Club
Dolly
Longstaffe
and
the
others
seemed
ideal
Those
fleshpots
of
Egypt
were
not
subtle
yet
they
flooded
my
little
firmament
With
a
chum
Charles
Sloan
I
contemplated
setting
up
a
trap
a
dog-cart
and
even
the
price
six
hundred
dollars
for
a
second-hand
affair
didn
t
daunt
us
Chestnut
Street
was
transformed
to
Piccadilly
the
Park
to
Rotten
Row
I
was
badly
bitten
I
only
read
English
fiction
preferably
Guy
Livingstone
I
recovered
from
this
attack
of
snobbish
measles
by
the
aid
of
music
that
universal
solvent
as
Henry
James
calls
it
But
London
was
my
dream-city
then
Paris
came
later
Dickens
had
fed
my
fancy
until
I
saw
a
Dickens
character
behind
every
tree
My
favourite
promenade
was
along
the
Delaware
River
water-front
as
far
north
as
Port
Richmond
How
I
revelled
in
the
ships
the
smell
of
tar
and
cordage
not
to
speak
of
the
brackish
water
It
was
all
in
the
tonality
of
London
and
need
I
add
that
when
I
first
visited
that
mighty
city
in
1878
I
was
disillusioned
Continued
residence
brought
back
the
enchantment
I
still
see
London
through
the
spectacles
of
Dickens
Thackeray
and
Trol
lope
In
the
nineties
George
Moore
gave
us
a
new
pair
of
spectacles
though
much
of
the
old
charm
had
gone
Boston
and
Philadelphia
are
the
two
American
cities
that
remind
me
of
London
certain
localities
be
it
un
derstood
New
York
is
so
original
that
it
is
monstrous
A
new
cosmopolis
one
that
Stendhal
greatest
of
cos
mopolitans
and
promenaders
of
souls
would
have
reviled
About
this
period
I
laid
the
keel
for
a
course
of
study
upon
which
if
the
ship
had
been
built
I
could
have
straightway
sailed
to
the
Blessed
Isles
of
Knowledge
The
faded
red
copy-book
I
still
treasure
wherein
I
wrote
yes
with
legible
hand
a
scheme
of
reading
that
would
have
staggered
Lord
Acton
and
a
more
omnivorous
reader
than
he
I
do
not
know
AH
English
American
Ital
ian
Spanish
French
German
and
classical
literatures
were
included
in
this
vast
undertaking
The
mere
tran
scription
of
the
authors
names
covered
many
pages
and
remember
I
only
selected
the
best
In
English
I
was
satisfied
to
begin
with
Chaucer
ending
with
Ruskin
and
Pater
Poets
dramatists
essayists
novelists
were
there
and
subdivisions
devoted
to
writers
on
special
subjects
art
music
science
It
was
a
five-hundred-feet
book
shelf
this
of
mine
and
at
least
five
hundred
and
more
authors
figured
on
it
a
Rabelaisian
feast
a
gluttonous
and
greedy
absorption
of
all
the
world
has
thought
and
written
When
I
read
of
Lord
Acton
s
proposed
History
of
Ideas
the
plan
seemed
perfectly
feasible
to
me
My
ignorance
was
on
a
par
with
my
ambitions
which
were
immeasurable
It
is
a
glorious
if
foolish
time
when
a
young
man
feels
that
the
earth
and
the
adjacent
planets
are
his
oyster
that
he
must
make
love
to
every
pretty
girl
that
he
will
be
rich
famous
happy
immortal
phew
what
moral
headaches
after
this
autointoxicated
nightmare
What
cruel
awakenings
at
cold
drab
dawn
Ah
Steeplejack
descend
rung
by
rung
your
shaky
ladder
and
bury
in
the
darkest
recesses
of
your
heart
the
clouded
visions
seen
from
the
spire
of
your
church
of
dreams
The
epical
list
would
edify
even
such
a
supercritic
as
Paul
Elmer
More
It
properly
began
with
Eschylus
or
was
it
GEsop
I
followed
the
alphabetical
order
and
ended
with
Xenophon
I
purged
all
the
lists
as
time
rolled
on
reading
all
the
while
as
if
some
devil
would
catch
the
hindmost
technical
books
multiplied
apace
Music
and
art
predominated
It
was
my
fate
to
enter
many
gardens
of
art
and
only
by
traversing
the
avenues
of
critical
literature
The
great
epics
were
my
constant
companions
thanks
to
the
judgment
of
my
mother
She
knew
and
loved
the
best
and
if
her
passion
for
the
life
of
the
spiritual
drove
her
to
the
reading
of
mediocre
religious
literature
her
taste
was
never
for
a
mo
ment
led
astray
This
trait
she
had
in
common
with
Huysmans
she
esteemed
the
piety
of
an
author
while
de
testing
his
style
Mrs
Craven
bored
and
so
did
Eugenie
de
Guerin
Thus
it
was
that
I
read
and
liked
St
Teresa
St
John
of
the
Cross
and
St
Catharine
of
Emmerich
It
wasn
t
a
wide
step
from
Dante
s
Inferno
to
John
of
the
Cross
s
Dark
Night
of
the
Soul
I
remember
a
friend
of
my
mother
s
an
invalid
Mrs
Joliffe
long
since
in
some
paradise
I
hope
so
fervently
did
she
long
for
it
she
was
a
Second
Adventist
and
once
when
the
Second
Coming
seemed
nigh
she
put
on
her
best
night-gown
and
in
company
with
a
band
of
pious
geese
she
went
on
the
housetop
to
be
nearer
the
sky
She
caught
a
bad
cold
but
her
belief
remained
unshaken
She
had
a
chart
of
tremendous
significance
over
which
I
was
allowed
to
pore
It
showed
the
swarming
hosts
of
Anti
christ
which
were
to
swoop
down
from
the
impenetrable
wilds
of
Russia
devils
with
high
cheek-bones
a
la
Tar
tare
though
hardly
a
pleasing
sauce
Most
of
us
be
lieve
to-day
that
Antichrist
didn
t
come
from
unhappy
Russia
but
then
the
Russian
was
an
unknown
factor
his
country
still
a
mystery
What
fun
that
map
of
Armageddon
was
My
mother
cautioned
me
against
its
apocalyptic
denunciations
yet
she
admitted
that
some
day
the
world
would
be
bathed
in
blood
but
the
cross
of
Christ
would
conquer
The
curious
part
of
my
study-book
is
that
I
lived
long
enough
to
read
and
reread
every
book
in
the
list
The
original
project
was
a
five-year
course
an
impossible
project
fifty
years
it
has
taken
me
Once
in
a
while
I
refresh
my
memory
by
reading
my
half-crazy
programme
When
music
had
gripped
my
vitals
I
did
the
same
thing
I
calmly
played
every
piano
study
that
I
could
lay
my
hands
on
and
lived
to
write
a
long
chapter
about
my
experiences
Now
I
realise
that
while
life
is
too
vast
to
be
compressed
into
any
single
formula
whether
religious
philosophical
or
artistic
universal
wisdom
has
been
dis
tilled
into
certain
books
All
Christianity
is
in
The
Imitation
of
Christ
and
the
quintessence
of
secular
wis
dom
may
be
found
in
Montaigne
No
better
gymnastic
for
the
spirit
is
there
than
Plato
and
woe
to
him
that
reads
not
the
Bible
not
alone
for
the
style
or
the
quo
tations
but
for
the
sake
of
his
miserable
soul
The
classics
Greek
and
Latin
are
what
Bach
and
Beethoven
are
to
musicians
Throw
metaphysics
to
the
dogs
unless
you
like
a
tortoise
pace
in
a
labyrinth
and
leading
nowhere
Lock
the
door
of
your
ivory
tower
and
drop
the
key
into
the
moat
But
I
am
boasting
All
those
books
did
not
make
me
wise
The
lucid
folly
of
love
is
more
illuminating
George
Moore
once
told
me
it
was
at
Baireuth
that
after
such
writing
as
Flaubert
s
the
young
pretender
to
pen-victories
had
better
sit
on
a
fence
and
enjoy
the
fresh
air
and
sunshine
I
believed
that
the
better
part
of
wisdom
was
to
stand
on
the
side
walk
of
life
and
regard
the
changing
spectacle
the
pass
ing
show
in
a
word
the
disinterested
attitude
of
an
artist
enamoured
of
appearances
and
the
bravery
of
surfaces
It
is
the
Hedonistic
pose
But
the
street
overflowed
my
tiny
pavement
and
I
was
swept
into
the
moving
currents
and
that
is
a
salutary
happening
for
all
save
the
elect
who
may
compass
the
life
contemplative
with
out
becoming
spiritually
sterile
Bacon
w
r
rote
that
In
this
world
God
only
and
the
angels
may
be
spectators
In
the
meantime
my
law
studies
were
on
the
shelf
In
despair
I
had
been
transferred
by
my
parents
to
the
law
and
conveyancing
offices
of
the
Hon
Daniel
M
Fox
a
distant
cousin
of
my
father
These
offices
were
at
No
508
Walnut
Street
facing
Independence
Square
I
chummed
with
a
young
lawyer
Harry
Hazlehurst
and
began
to
keep
professional
hours
Mr
Fox
saw
to
it
that
I
was
given
much
conveyancing
work
which
I
had
to
copy
in
a
clerkly
hand
and
his
son
H
K
Fox
helped
in
my
studies
I
frequented
the
Law
School
and
listened
to
young
Dick
Dale
who
was
to
become
a
brilliant
advocate
plead
a
fictitious
case
before
Judge
Sharswood
the
great
man
himself
who
was
kind
enough
to
further
the
cause
of
our
education
He
was
a
modest
reticent
man
whose
judgments
were
well-nigh
infallible
The
younger
men
worshipped
yet
stood
in
awe
of
him
His
influence
was
profound
I
almost
took
an
interest
in
the
abstract
questions
which
he
posed
A
friendship
with
a
young
man
about
this
time
made
the
law
more
human
for
me
His
name
was
Wicker
sham
Samuel
George
Woodward
Wickersham
He
lived
across
the
street
from
our
house
we
had
moved
down-town
to
Race
Street
before
the
Centennial
with
his
grandfather
George
Woodward
a
retired
publisher
From
the
windows
of
that
house
came
the
sound
of
music-making
It
was
a
cultivated
family
Aubertine
Woodward
played
the
piano
like
an
artiste
George
Woodward
her
brother
spouted
Swinburne
the
Poems
and
Ballads
and
from
his
lips
the
insidious
music
of
Dolores
first
fell
upon
my
enraptured
ears
Young
Wickersham
had
a
hard
row
to
hoe
His
grandfather
was
wealthy
but
he
believed
that
a
young
man
should
be
self-supporting
So
his
grandson
after
graduating
from
Lehigh
University
proposed
to
study
law
Well
and
good
said
this
shrewd
old
ancestor
but
how
do
you
propose
to
live
in
the
meanwhile
George
or
Sam
as
we
called
him
knew
that
he
had
a
roof
over
his
head
but
as
he
was
of
a
singularly
independent
disposi
tion
he
settled
the
question
by
mastering
telegraphy
reading
law
during
his
leisure
hours
I
can
see
him
in
his
little
telegraph
office
at
the
general
post-office
Chest
nut
Street
tapping
the
key
studying
Spanish
German
and
French
Carefully
apportioning
his
time
he
con
trived
to
work
twenty-five
hours
a
day
at
least
that
is
what
we
told
him
His
punctuality
became
notorious
As
the
evening
Angelus
rang
at
the
Cathedral
on
Logan
Square
my
father
would
take
out
his
watch
and
say
Sammy
is
due
and
sure
enough
he
would
turn
the
cor
ner
of
Race
and
Seventeenth
Streets
before
the
bells
ceased
As
he
didn
t
smoke
or
drink
he
had
leisure
when
needed
He
was
my
first
example
in
the
concrete
of
that
awful
word
efficiency
I
didn
t
pattern
after
him
but
I
admired
the
manner
in
which
he
organised
his
life
If
ever
a
man
went
straight
to
his
goal
it
was
young
Wickersham
He
had
Herbert
Spencer
at
his
tongue-tip
when
other
boys
were
reading
Beadle
s
dime
novels
One
day
I
went
to
see
him
for
a
chat
during
the
luncheon
hour
and
I
found
him
elated
over
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
a
swindler
named
Seaver
He
had
handled
the
case
alone
tracing
the
operations
of
the
fellow
through
the
telegrams
and
landed
his
man
to
the
great
relief
of
the
postal
authorities
who
had
despaired
of
the
task
The
subsequent
career
of
Wickersham
is
history
political
and
otherwise
He
passed
his
last
examinations
went
to
New
York
engaged
in
practice
a
corporation
lawyer
now
of
the
first
rank
and
onetime
United
States
Attorney
General
during
the
Taft
admin
istration
We
wrangled
like
all
young
men
and
I
often
heard
him
declare
that
for
him
the
law
would
only
be
a
stepping-stone
to
political
power
He
was
not
of
a
religious
turn
but
he
espoused
the
cause
of
the
Quaker
telling
me
that
it
was
the
one
truly
spiritual
religion
without
dogmas
superstitions
or
sacerdotal
flummeries
and
invariably
I
would
reply
A
religion
without
dogma
is
a
body
without
a
skeleton
it
won
t
stand
upright
Now
the
position
is
reversed
Mr
Wickersham
is
a
good
churchman
an
Episcopalian
and
I
admire
the
Quakers
He
reproached
me
for
my
faineant
attitude
towards
life
Be
up
and
doing
was
his
policy
and
I
would
smile
indulgently
at
his
robust
will
and
tremendous
capacity
for
taking
pains
above
all
his
intellect
which
could
assimilate
the
toughest
problems
pulverise
cob
blestones
and
macerate
the
arguments
of
his
legal
opponents
all
those
qualifications
for
a
successful
career
seemed
to
me
so
much
waste
of
time
and
energy
I
must
have
been
an
annoying
person
to
sensible
men
I
have
wondered
how
all
the
kind
people
who
advised
me
then
and
since
had
so
much
patience
their
advice
I
could
not
or
would
not
act
upon
The
other
side
of
George
Woodward
Wickersham
is
rather
astonishing
He
has
a
well-developed
aesthetic
culture
He
learned
to
love
Black
and
White
from
studying
my
father
s
col
lection
and
to-day
he
buys
mezzotints
and
engravings
By
his
music
he
came
naturally
I
don
t
think
he
plays
on
any
instrument
but
he
knows
the
tone-language
after
a
long
apprenticeship
at
his
home
He
looks
the
same
to
me
as
he
did
four
decades
ago
barring
a
greyer
head
He
is
the
picture
of
a
grave
Spaniard
an
illusion
that
is
not
dispelled
when
he
speaks
the
language
though
he
has
the
vivacity
of
an
Italian
A
traveller
linguist
man
of
the
world
rich
famous
and
erudite
I
think
Philadelphia
has
reason
to
be
proud
of
her
son
even
if
he
was
born

Pittsburgh
Again
I
changed
my
law
preceptor
New
Year
1878
Walnut
Street
The
building
has
not
changed
a
bit
Across
the
street
were
the
offices
of
Benjamin
Harris
Brewster
and
John
G
Johnson
Again
I
became
a
window-watcher
of
other
people
s
doings
instead
of
poking
my
nose
into
my
own
business
which
was
sup
posed
to
be
the
law
It
was
my
last
chance
Pernicious
were
my
activities
otherwise
Another
crisis
had
super
vened
music
and
I
never
got
over
the
attack
never
shall
until
I
die
A
book
had
decided
my
vocation
St
Martin
s
Summer
by
Annie
Hampton
Brewster
sister
or
half-sister
of
Attorney
General
Brewster
I
had
the
courage
to
speak
to
him
about
this
book
and
he
was
pleased
I
could
see
that
Burnt-face
Brewster
as
he
was
so
charitably
nicknamed
was
a
charming
man
with
a
high
fluting
voice
polished
manners
and
a
flow
of
profanity
that
stirred
my
young
manhood
to
its
centre
I
heard
him
curse
an
absent
member
of
his
family
in
the
form
of
a
syllogism
that
made
my
spine
freeze
He
ad
mired
his
brilliant
cultured
sister
as
a
matter
of
course
all
the
Brewsters
were
brilliant
and
cultured
Doubtless
his
deformity
a
face
from
which
fire
had
burnt
nearly
all
semblance
of
humanity
made
his
blasphemy
more
impressive
He
reminded
me
of
a
ghastly
illustration
in
Tom
Moore
s
Lalla
Rookh
a
fanciful
portrait
of
the
false
prophet
Query
What
is
the
difference
between
a
false
or
true
prophet
Aren
t
they
both
fakirs
Like
Wilkes
said
to
have
been
the
ugliest
man
in
Eng
land
Benjamin
Harris
Brewster
used
to
boast
that
after
five
minutes
had
elapsed
he
could
make
any
woman
for
get
his
hideous
mask
True
but
they
must
have
been
shuddering
minutes
I
was
attracted
by
his
ugliness
As
a
pleader
before
a
jury
he
was
very
convincing
though
I
doubt
if
he
had
the
acumen
of
his
next-door
neigh
bour
John
G
Johnson
or
the
persuasiveness
of
Daniel
Dougherty
Mr
Johnson
was
a
heavy-appearing
man
with
seal
like
mustaches
sullen
expression
and
slow
but
pene
trating
glance
who
had
a
way
of
winning
cases
that
made
him
the
envy
of
his
colleagues
He
was
not
ad
mired
by
his
staff
I
disliked
his
personality
Years
later
I
told
him
how
he
rather
scared
us
with
his
grim
ness
and
he
smiled
In
reality
he
was
very
human
After
I
saw
his
pictures
I
forgot
the
bogie
of
Walnut
Street
Boys
are
a
queer
lot
There
was
Mr
Brewster
a
demon
of
irritability
but
a
born
wheedler
when
he
willed
and
Mr
Johnson
never
choleric
impassive
if
anything
yet
we
young
chaps
gave
our
admiration
to
the
uglier
man
Mr
Wayne
MacVeagh
had
an
office
in
the
same
building
as
Mr
Brewster
I
knew
by
sight
all
the
heavy
swells
of
the
profession
I
wonder
whether
they
were
as
great
men
as
people
believed
Public
men
like
actors
live
in
an
artificial
illumination
I
recall
what
Richard
Wagner
said
of
Bismarck
and
Van
Buest
the
latter
had
pursued
the
composer
for
his
political
opinions
with
unabated
rancour
for
Wagner
was
a
political
refugee
since
1849
Political
great
men
so
called
statesmen
are
not
great
they
usually
have
medi
ocre
intelligences
but
are
crafty
and
flatter
the
people
who
are
always
greedy
for
praise
like
collar-wearing
dogs
averred
the
musician
They
do
more
harm
than
good
in
a
few
years
they
are
forgotten
while
a
master
painter
poet
musician
lives
on
forever
The
coin
out
lasts
Caesar
as
Theophile
Gautier
properly
observed
Not
a
novel
assertion
this
of
the
greatest
composer
of
music-drama
but
it
contains
more
than
a
moiety
of
the
truth
The
great
men
of
my
day
I
ve
forgotten
Lin
coln
excepted
But
the
busy
little
lawyers
the
grave
and
learned
judges
the
pestiferous
politicians
with
their
incessant
clamourings
their
raising
of
false
stupid
dangerous
issues
where
are
they
all
Not
a
book
not
a
picture
not
a
melody
did
they
bequeath
to
us
and
so
they
are
irretrievably
dead
This
is
extremely
hard
on
those
humbugs
the
reformers
My
restlessness
increased
spiritually
physically
One
might
fancy
that
after
all
these
seismic
manifestations
that
at
least
a
mouse
would
crawl
out
from
my
moun
tain
in
parturition
Nary
a
mouse
Only
dissatisfac
tion
with
the
universe
and
not
a
finger
lifted
to
set
it
right
I
was
the
square
peg
in
the
round
hole
that
s
all
According
to
ridiculous
custom
of
the
country
I
had
been
taken
to
a
phrenologist
Professor
Fowler
to
have
my
bumps
felt
my
genius
proclaimed
my
share
on
the
globe
staked

Phrenology
thanks
to
the
labours
of
Spurzheim
and
Gall
was
once
believed
in
its
true
relation
to
our
knowledge
of
the
brain
being
what
astrology
is
to
astronomy
But
the
superstition
pre
vailed
Solemnly
my
expectant
mother
was
assured
that
I
had
a
capacity
for
anything
if
I
could
be
per
suaded
to
apply
myself
seriously
which
I
never
could
furthermore
I
had
the
centrifugal
temperamant
not
the
centripetal
President
Wilson
has
the
centripetal
tem
perament
or
as
he
puts
it
a
one-track
mind
So
has
my
friend
Mr
Wickersham
Both
men
concentrate
Colonel
Roosevelt
had
the
centrifugal
cast
of
mind
evidently
I
have
the
same
I
fly
off
with
ease
on
any
tempting
tangent
also
off
my
handle
The
aptitude
dis
played
by
the
Yankee
for
a
half-dozen
pursuits
is
the
sign-manual
of
the
centrifugal
soul
It
is
pleasant
to
hear
the
whirring
of
its
wheels
though
they
serve
no
particular
purpose
Thrashing
the
sea
eating
the
air
promise-crammed
filling
the
belly
with
the
east
wind
fighting
windmills
these
are
a
few
attributes
of
the
cen
trifugalist
He
is
nothing
if
not
versatile
His
intensity
lasts
ten
minutes
He
is
focal
in
consciousness
as
the
psychologists
say
but
his
marginal
subconsciousness
is
strongly
obtruded
The
sensory
periphery
is
more
mas
terful
than
the
hub
of
his
being
When
Professor
Fowler
was
told
that
my
birthday
occurred
on
the
last
day
of
January
he
exclaimed
The
Water-Carrier
and
seemed
relieved
Sons
of
Aquarius
fickle
thirsty
not
water
for
knowledge
are
the
rolling
stones
that
gather
no
moss
Now
that
had
always
appealed
to
me
the
non
gathering
of
moss
Precisely
for
that
reason
the
roll
ing
stone
is
more
successful
than
its
stationary
brother
who
accumulates
the
moss
of
decadence
The
centrifugal
ist
is
usually
an
optimist
All
is
for
the
best
in
this
best
of
demi-mondes
The
flowers
of
evil
that
blossom
in
the
hothouse
of
hell
become
pretty
pansies
when
plucked
by
a
centrifugal
poet
There
are
a
lot
more
things
I
could
tell
you
in
defense
of
this
nature
but
these
arguments
made
no
impression
on
my
parents
who
were
beginning
to
suspect
that
I
was
a
shirker
I
was
though
my
wak
ing
hours
were
stuffed
with
febrile
gestures
If
I
had
been
a
poet
I
might
have
replied
to
my
critics
that
I
was
beat
ing
my
luminous
wings
in
the
void
but
being
neither
Shelley
nor
Arnold
I
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
watched
the
sky
hoping
roast
larks
would
fall
into
my
expectant
mouth
Daniel

said
to

sulking
in
the

the

is
a
jealous
mistress
and
if
the
boy
doesn
t
like

set
him
to
something
he
does

I
mentally
ap
plauded
this
decision
though
I
wondered
at
the
banality
of
the
quotation
I
was
at
the
hypercritical
age
believ
ing
that
no
phrase
should
be
repeated
an
insane
notion
that
often
afflicts
stylists
Mr
Dougherty
was
then
in
the
flower
of
his
reputation
though
he
hadn
t
yet
made
his
famous
speech
nominating
Grover
Cleveland
His
trump
card
was
oratory
He
held
most
juries
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
His
devotion
to
the
Irish
cause
to
my
grandfather
James
Gibbons
who
had
encouraged
his
youthful
ambitions
was
unquestionable
although
he
was
worldly
enough
as
are
all
lawyers
to
foresee
that
the
Fenian
cause
was
a
forlorn
hope
As
he
possessed
tact
he
knew
how
to
carry
water
on
both
shoulders
but
as
a
churchman
his
sincerity
could
not
be
challenged
His
relations
with
my
parents
were
cordial
and
despite
the
changing
years
he
was
always
Dan
to
them
From
what
I
have
been
told
his
legal
erudition
was
hardly
profound
rhetoric
flowery
and
forcible
was
his
forte
However
they
never
called
him
Judge
Neces
sity
as
they
did
Judge
Allison
or
was
it
old
Judge
Finletter
because
Necessity

no

Daniel
Dougherty

many
men
of
Irish
blood
had
the
head

Handsome
eloquent
scornful
his

of

times

freckle-faced
Later
Dick
became
a

and
need
I
add
a
figure
in
the
field
of
fiction
I
wonder
if
Charlie
Davis
ever
recalls
the
Ruff
yard
and
the
fierce
games
in
which
pirates
were
heroes
Sam
Wickersham
didn
t
believe
in
pirates
he
only
believed
in
lawyers
But
the
clearest
call
of
my
life
was
sounding
Music

to

hopelessly

PHILADELPHIA
Philadelphia
is
a
music-loving
city
Its
history
proves
the
assertion
Opera
in
Italian
has
always
had
a
vogue
and
like
opera
elsewhere
it
is
first
fashionable
then
artistic
Real
music
that
means
orchestral
has
a
fol
lowing
there
which
is
gratifying
though
a
local
symphony
orchestra
they
have
not
had
so
many
years
Visiting
orchestras
with
solo
singers
pianists
violinists
and
other
instrumentalists
supplied
our
early
deficiency
Honour
is
due
to
such
pioneers
as
Michael
H
Cross
and
Charles
H
Jarvis
whose
portraits
in
bronze
adorn
the
lobby
of
the

The

were
in

before
the
advent
of
Theodore
Thomas
and
his
orchestra
They
were
not
financially
successful
but
much
good
came
from
them
Young

enjoyed
the
classical
repertory
Haydn

Beethoven
Schubert
Schumann

and
were
well

And
this
was
as
it
should
be
At
Michael
Cross
s
string
quartet
parties
on
Saturday
nights
I
heard
the
entire
quartet
literature
I
was
only
a
youngster
but
I
could
hum
the
themes
from
any
of
the
numerous
Haydn
quartets
and
at
one
time
urged
thereto
by
Louis
Gaertner
I
began
to
fiddle
hoping
to
master
the
viola
parts
The
original
Cross
quartet
consisted
of
Carl
Gaertner
Sr
alternating
with
William
StoII
Simon
Stern
second
Roggenberger
viola
Michael
Cross
violoncello
At
the
age
of
forty
Mr
Cross
took
up
the
cello
and
played
it
in

His
teacher
was
Leopold
Engelke
our
vocal
director
at
the
Roth
Academy
When
Engelke
or
Charles
Schmitz
a

took

played

usually
stayed

the

empty
Mr
Cross
undertook
my
musical
education
He
was
rather
cynical
on
the
subject
advising
me
to
stick
to
the
law
for
said
he
the
musician
s
life
is
a
dog
s
life
He
was
truly
a
cynical
man
in
all
his
views
His
versatility
was
marked
I
best
liked
his
piano
playing
though
his
technique
was
limited
but
he
had
a
singing
touch
his
taste
was
sound
his
style
clear
and
musical
He
played
Mozart
in
a
limpid
manner
and
the
Field
Nocturne
was
his
battle-horse
His
organ-playing
leaned
heavily
on
improvisation
He
was
not
a
virtuoso
on
any
instru
ment
He
taught
all
a
chorus
conductor
of
the
Orpheus
and
the
St
Cecilia

years

I
began
to
hope
for
his
conver

modern

The
truth
is
that
in

then
Mendelssohn
was
first

the
others
somewhere
out
in

field

rival

was
concealed
rivalry

the
two
men
was
Charles
H
Jarvis
a
piano
virtuoso
of
the
first
rank
that
is
in
a

of
playing
long
since
obsolete
He
had
been
technically
grounded
in
Hummel
and
his
delicate
touch
pearly
scales
and
finished
style
were
unimpeachable
His
musicianship
was
not
so
broad
in
scope
as
Cross
s
but
it
was
more
thorough
He
was
master
of
the
keyboard
nothing
else
he
didn

compose

play
on
a
stringed

was

he
could
have
challenged
Saint-Saens
though
not
of
orchestral
scores
He
never
played
without
notes
telling
me
that
some
day
von
Billow
or
Rubinstein
would
break
down
in
public
He
had
not
a
musical
memory
that
was
the
reason
De
Pachmann
never
played
concerto
with
orchestra
with
out
notes
he
once
had
a
bad
smash-up
in
public
Jarvis
was
not
so
musical
as
Cross
He
was
an
intellectual
artist
not
an
emotional
one
Tonal
monotony
was
felt
by
his
audience
before
the
end
of
his
lengthy
programmes
The
illuminating
phrase
never
came
but
there
was
infallible
technique
and
a
flowing
style
One
Summer
he
gave
twenty
private
recitals
at
his
residence
on
North
Nineteenth
Street
devoted
to
the
historical
development
of
piano
music
and
not
only
solo
but
chamber-music
duos
trios
quartets
quintets
sextets
septets
and
octets
Onslow
Hummel
Fesca
Schumann
Schubert
Beethoven
Mozart
Haydn
Carl
Gaertner
fiddled
first
as
usual
and
made
up
for
uncouth
method
and
scratching
by
his
enthusiasm
and
genuine
musical
understanding
It
was
positively
fascinating
for
me
to
see
Charlie
Jarvis
in
his
shirt
sleeves
like
his
confreres
ploughing
through
a
mass
of
antiquated
compositions
fancy
Onslow
or
KaJkbrenner
or
the
Ries
piano
concerto
in
C
sharp
minor
and
with
a
vim
that
was
stimulating
At
the
Cross
parties
I
heard
the
old
string-quartet
litera
ture
the
piano
was
seldom
used
at
the
Jarvis
recitals
all
piano
concertos
with
string
quartet
accompanying
from
the
Bach
D
minor
to
Henselt
s
in
F
minor
were
given
in
a
finished
manner
though
profound
interpre
tations
were
absent
Von
Billow
was
the
piano
god
of
Jarvis
for
Cross
it
was
only
Rubinstein
And
Cross
was
right
Years
later
and
shortly
before
his
sudden
and
lamentable
death
Charles
Jarvis
visited
me
at
the
office
of
the
Musical
Courier
then
on
Union
Square
His
opinions
of
music
and
musicians
had
little
changed
He
had
spent
several
years
abroad
He
complained
that
modern
piano
virtuosi
banged
too
much
and
he
didn
t
hesitate
to
condemn
the
so-called
orchestral
style
Liszt
and
Rubinstein
were
to
blame
the
latter
had
a
marvellous
touch
but
he
couldn
t
hold
a
candle
to
Thai
berg
in
the
art
of
singing
on
the
keyboard
I
heard
the
same
judgment
from
the
lips
of
Georges
Mathias
of
the
Paris
Conservatoire
a
pupil
of
Chopin
who
declared
that
Rubinstein
butchered
the
exquisite
music
of
Chopin
Back
to
Hummel
cried
Jarvis
With
all
my
heart
I
said
but
to
play
in
the
colourless
withal
chaste
manner
of
Hummel
and
to
pass
over
as
non-existent
the
modern
palette
of
tone-colour
with
its
varied
range
its
nuances
its
atmospheric
pedalling
no
that
would
be
impossi
ble
You
may
set
the
clock
back
an
hour
but
you
can
t
fool
the
sun
As
a
matter
of
history
we
have
heard
three
pianists
who
combined
the
purity
of
the
Hummel
school
with
the
iridescent
colour-scheme
of
the
moderns
need
I
mention
the
names
of
Vladimir
de
Pachmann
Rafael
Joseffy
and
Leopold
Godowsky
The
violinist
Carl
Gaertner
there
was
no
von
as
a
handle
to
his
name
then
was
an
eccentric
man
of
vio
lent
temper
his
heart
however
in
the
right
place
but
he
was
as
vain
as
a
peacock
He
was
a
perfect
example
of
the
popular
conception
of
a
musician
He
acted
in
a
crazy
fashion
whenever
he
had
an
audience
of
even
two
but
he
wasn
t
crazy
far
from
it
My
mother
who
heartily
disliked
his
rude
pranks
admitted
his
brains
Jewish
brains
she
called
them
Gaertner
came
to
America
about
the
same
time
as
Carl
Sentz
and
was
a
drummer
in
the
band
He
studied
the
violin
after
set
tling
here
and
never
mastered
it
He
often
played
out
of
tune
and
his
style
lacked
tonal
suavity
and
facile
technique
His
vanity
as
a
musician
was
only
topped
by
his
masculine
conceit
A
preposterous
dandy
he
thought
he
was
irresistible
with
the
unfair
sex
When
he
strutted
down
Chestnut
Street
he
was
literally
the
observed
of
all
observers
No
wonder
A
waist
pinched
in
he
undoubtedly
wore
a
corset
his
shoulders
pad
ded
a
low-cut
collar
revealing
too
much
neck
long
floating
hair
elaborately
curled
surmounted
by
a
grace
less
chimney-pot
invariably
a
crimson
necktie
yellow
kid
gloves
trousers
painfully
tight
lacquered
boots
with
straps
he
was
simply
wonderful
Through
narrowed
eyes
he
disdainfully
regarded
the
passing
crowd
His
contempt
for
Americans
was
true
to
type
Because
Philadelphians
refused
to
admire
his
scraping
of
the
classics
though
good-humouredly
mocked
his
affecta
tions
therefore
we
were
pigs
blind
to
finer
issues
So
he
fought
on
and
in
the
end
did
accomplish
something
His
zeal
for
good
music
found
expression
in
his
concerts
given
as
a
rule
in
the
Foyer
of
the
Academy
of
Music
I
don
t
believe
they
were
lucrative
any
more
than
the
Jarvis
Soirees
at
Natatormm
Hall
across
the
street
But
they
served
their
purpose
There
a
small
nucleus
of
music-lovers
were
introduced
to
the
best
in
musical
literature
To
be
sure
the
terrible
old
man
fiddled
like
a
demon
but
a
virile
demon
oh
how
he
hated
Sarasate
and
the
whole
tribe
of
sugar
water
violinists
and
stamped
his
foot
so
loudly
that
one
night
Rudolph
Hennig
a
true
artist
on
the
violoncello
warned
him
if
he
didn
t
stop
he
would
quit
the
quartet
It
is
a
fact
that
in
the
Gaertner
music
studio
there
were
three
busts
Mozart
Beethoven
and
Carl
Gaertner
s
How
pain
ful
were
our
lessons
In
company
with
Franz
Schubert
already
an
excellent
violinist
I
stood
a
weekly
brow
beating
that
would
have
discouraged
a
Joachim
Hein
you
think
you
play
the
viola
some
day
Hein
A
toy
fiddle
is
what
you
ought
to
get
hein
all
this
in
a
raging
voice
and
with
an
accent
that
would
have
made
him
a
hero
at
Weber
and
Fields
He
bullied
poor
Schu
bert
who
finally
rebelled
though
in
a
mildly
sarcastic
way
He
told
the
old
man
When
you
learn
to
play
in
tune
then
I
may
learn
something
from
you
We
fled
at
once
after
this
pursued
by
stormy
vows
of
vengeance
My
father
was
informed
that
I
played
like
five
pigs
that
I
had
better
study
that
tin
pan
the
piano
The
two
sons
of
Gaertner
were
musical
Carl
Jr
on
the
cello
Louis
the
violin
a
pupil
of
Joachim
and
a
far
better
artist
than
his
father
When
Wilhelmj
came
to
Philadelphia
in
1880
he
had
as
accompanists
Max
Vogrich
Hungarian
pianist
and
composer
and
Constantine
Sternberg
a
Russian
piano
virtuoso
and
I
think
a
composer
of
piano
music
worthy
enough
to
be
ranked
in
the
same
class
with
Scharwenka
and
Moszkowski
Perhaps
he
remembers
the
scene
in
the
green
room
of
the
Academy
when
Carl
Gaertner
pompously
entered
gave
his
card
to
the
giant
August
Wilhelmj
and
politely
remarked
If
I
played
the
Mendelssohn
concerto
as
you
did
to-night
I
would
be
hissed
off
the
stage
as
you
should
have
been
All
this
in
German
Wilhelmj
who
had
played
like
a
god
re
mained
impassive
called
to
his
secretary
Hans
show
this
gentleman
the
door
After
that
Wilhelmj
could
not
play
at
all
according
to
his
irate
critic
But
Gaert
ner
met
his
match
in
Eduard
Remenyi
who
was
the
Liszt
of
the
fiddle
technically
This
little
bald
Hungarian
Jew
who
looked
like
a
fat
unfrocked
priest
came
to
see
us
on
Sunday
nights
A
linguist
a
travelled
man
of
culture
he
was
always
interesting
He
was
playing
at
the
time
at
Mannerchor
Garden
at
Franklin
Street
and
Fairmount
Avenue
kept
by
Robert
Tagg
and
I
think
down
on
his
luck
Carl
Sentz
led
these
open-air
concerts
Remenyi
abused
Brahms
in
a
public
address
for
steal
ing
a
Hungarian
dance
of
his
We
heard
lots
about
Liszt
and
Wagner
from
him
It
was
true
that
he
played
in
concert
with
both
Liszt
and
Brahms
His
real
name
he
told
us
was
Hoffman
Remenyi
is
Hoffman
translated
into
Hungarian
I
am
a
born
Roman
Catholic
an
Abbe
he
avowed
to
my
mother
and
then
winked
at
my
father
adding
in
an
undertone
a
Kosher
Abbe
He
looked
it
He
always
fetched
with
him
to
any
musical
reunions
two
violins
a
Stradivarius
and
a
Guarnerius
He
called
one
of
them
the
Princess
which
one
I
forget
His
tone
was
full
his
style
supple
With
what
head-wagging
he
would
play
his
fiery
version
of
the
Rackoczy
March
or
with
what
a
sliding
technique
he
would
fiddle
the
D
flat
Valse
of
Chopin
a
difficult
feat
not
alone
because
of
the
treacherous
double-thirds
sixths
octaves
and
tenths
but
because
of
the
dizzy
speed
and
the
ungrateful
key
of
D
flat
He
was
a
master
of
masters
Remenyi
and
his
charlatanism
was
only
a
copy
of
Paganini
s
and
Liszt
s
A
member
of
an
old
Hungarian
noble
house
the
De
Vay
a
distinguished
prelate
of
the
same
family
visited
America
later
turned
up
in
the
city
playing
the
violin
in
superlative
fashion
and
gambling
away
every
dollar
he
earned
in
concert-giving
This
Leonard
de
Vay
had
studied
with
Remenyi
and
when
he
encountered
his
master
he
was
embarrassed
He
too
had
his
violin
and
with
him
was
an
extraordinary
clarinet
virtuoso
the
E
flat
clarinet
a
Hungarian
named
Matrai
Pista
that
is
Peter
Matus
or
Matrai
When
my
father
saw
De
Vay
face
Remenyi
not
shaking
his
hand
he
whispered
to
me
Look
out
the
fur
will
fly
Luckily
it
didn
t
Rem
enyi
bowed
and
said
a
few
welcoming
words
in
Hun
garian
but
De
Vay
did
not
take
his
fiddle
from
its
case
Matus
opened
the
evening
with
a
cascade
of
notes
a
richly
embroidered
Hungarian
Czardas
unac
companied
which
he
naively
confessed
he
had
made
up
after
hearing
some
gypsies
play
on
their
native
Putzta
Remenyi
was
interested
He
complimented
the
clarinetist
who
was
later
with
the
Gilmore
band
and
as
he
had
coached
me
in
the
piano
parts
of
Wieniawski
s
Legende
and
Prume
s
Melancholia
I
was
forced
to
accompany
this
very
great
artist
Remenyi
played
with
passion
and
poesy
The
climax
of
the
evening
was
his
tender
interpretation
of
Schubert
s
Ser
enade
which
he
delivered
on
his
knees
before
my
mother
who
took
his
homage
in
good
temper
My
father
was
greatly
annoyed
why
I
can
t
understand
for
Remenyi
was
all
smiles
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
Parcel
of
fools
was
the
governor
s
verdict
when
the
party
left
That
night
must
have
been
one
of
wild
revelry
according
to
the
report
of
Matus
They
went
to
some
cafe
and
at
seven
in
the
morning
were
quarrelling
over
a
question
of
technique
But
in
the
evening
Remenyi
played
in
his
accustomed
form
at
the
Garden
while
De
Vay
eloquently
held
forth
at
a
garden
on
Girard
Avenue
be
low
Seventh
Street
As
I
said
old
man
Gaertner
came
off
second
best
in
the
tilt
he
had
with
Remenyi
Remenyi
was
a
bit
of
a
charlatan
but
Gaertner
was
the
bigger
of
the
pair
One
night
after
the
Hungarian
virtuoso
had
finished
a
Bach
Sonata
unaccompanied
oh
yes
we
listened
to
Bach
at
open-air
concerts
in
those
benighted
days
when
a
hissing
was
heard
Remenyi
bowed
Will
the
critic
who
hissed
my
Bach
please
make
himself
known
he
said
in
his
ironic
manner
Immediately
the
only
Carl
Gaertner
arose
anxious
to
vindicate
the
musical
taste
of
the
town
You
play
Bach
like
a
fool
he
roared
Remenyi
smiled
Then
in
a
burst
of
gener
osity
he
tendered
his
violin
to
Gaertner
adding
Per
haps
I
do
but
will
my
critic
show
me
how
not
to
play
Bach
like
a
fool
He
underlined
not
and
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
stalked
out
of
the
garden
followed
by
howls
and
jeers
Remenyi
won
that
time
The
occurrence
got
into
the
newspapers
but
Carl
Gaert
ner
never
turned
a
hair
The
only
man
who
did
succeed
in
taking
the
starch
out
of
his
ludicrous
dignity
was
a
young
barytone
Max
Heinrich
by
name
afterwards
to
become
a
significant
figure
in
the
musical
world
One
night
a
wet
night
after
much
music-making
at
the
Cross
house
the
party
went
in
search
of
more
refresh
ment
solid
and
liquid
An
old
hostelry
stood
at
the
corner
of
Race
and
Sixteenth
Streets
and
was
kept
by
a
publican
named
Dunn
The
place
was
noted
for
its
fish
cakes
and
musty
ale
There
a
certain
convocation
took
place
and
during
its
progress
Gaertner
said
something
in
praise
of
Germany
At
once
Max
Heinrich
went
up
into
the
air
He
had
escaped
military
duty
in
Saxony
and
had
become
an
ardent
lover
of
our
democracy
He
cursed
the
old
Kaiser
he
cursed
Bismarck
and
he
made
so
much
noise
that
the
lobby
was
broken
up
by
Pop
Dunn
who
didn
t
like
rows
on
his
premises
early
Sun
day
morning
Squabbling
the
violinist
and
singer
went
to
the
sidewalk
to
settle
their
differences
Although
the
elder
Carl
Gaertner
was
a
powerful
deep-chested
man
with
muscles
like
steel
he
would
have
made
mince-meat
of
the
slender
Heinrich
if
he
could
have
reached
him
But
Max
knew
better
Taking
a
glittering
weapon
from
his
back
pocket
he
pointed
it
at
Gaertner
crying
Go
down
on
your
knees
and
say
To
H-II
with
Bismarck
or
Til
shoot
you
through
the
gizzard
Scared
the
old
man
did
as
he
was
told
and
renounced
Bismarck
and
all
his
works
Then
Heinrich
shrieked
with
laughter
It
was
only
a
metal
shoe-buttoner
that
pistol
In
the
fracas
some
one
lost
his
false
teeth
and
there
was
much
rummaging
and
lighting
of
matches
before
they
were
restored
to
the
owner
But
after
that
affair
Gaertner
hid
his
patriotism
under
a
bushel
In
1916
when
Heinrich
died
he
was
as
implacable
a
foe
to
his
Fatherland
politically
considered
as
in
the
middle
seventies
He
was
as
well-known
in
London
as
in
San
Francisco
as
a
singer
of
Schubert
Schumann
and
Brahms
With
few
exceptions
I
never
met
a
man
so
completely
an
artist
as
he
His
voice
was
not
remarkable
a
barytone
with
a
low
range
a
basso
cantante
he
called
himself
His
tone
was
often
hard
hollow
gum
my
is
the
exact
word
and
his
enunciation
guttural
He
never
mastered
English
his
pronunciation
after
many
years
residence
here
and
in
England
leaving
much
to
be
desired
yet
his
musical
intelligence
the
emotional
temperament
carried
his
hearers
away
literally
on
the
wings
of
song
In
his
best
estate
his
work
in
Elijah
or
any
of
the
classical
oratorios
was
unapproachable
and
he
had
plenty
of
rivals
in
that
field
with
more
sonorous
voices
Franz
Remmertz
among
the
rest
But
Heinrich
outshone
them
all
musically
the
intensity
of
his
dra
matic
nature
transfigured
his
rather
commonplace
vocal
resources
His
versatility
was
best
expressed
in
song
interpretations
Such
an
emotional
range
and
feeling
for
swiftly
changing
moods
I
have
never
heard
with
the
exception
of
Marcella
Sembrich
and
Lilli
Lehmann
And
remember
that
he
had
no
personal
glamour
in
the
sense
of
good
looks
as
had
these
women
singers
his
bold
hawk-like
profile
and
too
narrow
face
were
not
par
ticularly
attractive
had
he
not
such
brilliant
eyes
which
mirrored
his
evanescent
moods
He
was
magnetic
light
hearted
generous
and
I
fear
that
he
hung
his
fiddle
outside
the
door
as
they
say
in
Ireland
Yet
he
was
not
only
the
joy
of
the
street
and
the
sorrow
of
the
house
hold
but
also
a
joy
at
home
A
more
loving
and
quick
tempered
father
I
never
saw
Happily
married
to
a
musical
wife
Anna
Schubert
Heinrich
he
lived
every
minute
he
could
spare
from
his
professional
duties
and
his
little
house
with
a
garden
in
front
was
on
Cherry
below
Twentieth
Street
It
is
there
to-day
Max
who
was
the
father
of
at
least
eight
or
ten
children
led
the
life
of
an
artistic
sybarite
His
versatility
was
not
con
fined
to
his
music
he
played
his
own
accompaniments
in
an
incomparable
style
but
manifested
itself
in
painting
He
was
mad
over
landscape
and
animals
In
the
house
besides
babies
which
sprawled
everywhere
you
would
encounter
a
wind-hound
a
flute
on
four
legs
puppies
of
various
breeds
and
a
formidable
Russian
mastiff
broad
of
chest
with
a
baying
voice
that
sent
policemen
scurrying
round
the
block
A
cruel
beast
I
often
saw
it
jump
from
a
second-story
window
to
the
lawn
and
nab
a
cat
by
the
neck
Crunch
The
cat
s
spine
was
broken
Max
named
the
brute
Bismarck
I
asked
him
why
for
I
knew
he
hated
the
Iron
Chancellor
Because
he
kills
so
many
cats
was
the
cryptic
reply
followed
by
peals
of
sarcastic
laughter
There
was
a
Mephisto
concealed
in
Heinrich
And
the
birds
They
were
uncaged
and
owned
the
house
A
spectacle
for
the
gods
was
Max
Heinrich
as
stark
as
the
day
he
was
born
pipe
in
mouth
palette
in
one
hand
brush
in
the
other
sitting
in
his
half-filled
bathtub
painting
an
imaginary
landscape
the
easel
stretched
across
the
tub
It
s
cool
he
would
say
on
one
of
those
sweltering
August
mornings
when
other
people
s
vitality
would
be
depleted
by
such
sultry
con
ditions
he
on
the
contrary
was
more
noisy
more
vig
orous
than
ever
The
joy
of
life
That
he
had
as
few
have
it
He
tingled
with
vitality
He
imparted
his
high
spirits
to
his
companions
The
babies
sat
up
and
gurgled
when
he
passed
the
birds
flew
to
his
shoulder
the
dogs
barked
A
happy
household
His
nervous
wife
would
sometimes
go
outdoors
to
escape
this
trucu
lent
happiness
She
was
blonde
charming
possessing
a
divine
patience
not
only
as
a
mother
but
as
an
artiste
She
sang
musically
At
Concordia
Hall
I
saw
her
as
Marguerite
to
her
husband
s
Mephisto
She
looked
the
part
without
make-up
It
was
as
a
guitar
virtuosa
however
that
she
made
her
reputation
She
mastered
that
difficult
and
ungrateful
instrument
making
it
something
more
than
mere
string
strumming
I
have
heard
her
play
the
A
flat
study
of
Chopin
the
Aeolian
Harp
most
effectively
The
little
menage
didn
t
al
ways
run
on
oiled
wheels
for
Heinrich
was
a
bohemian
to
whom
regular
hours
were
destructive
of
his
own
per
sonal
rhythms
which
were
many
He
earned
plenty
of
money
and
spent
it
though
his
family
came
first
He
sang
at
the
Cathedral
where
my
mother
had
introduced
him
to
Father
Elcock
and
on
Saturdays
he
sang
at
the
Hebrew
Synagogue
on
Broad
Street
He
had
all
the
brilliancy
and
versatility
of
the
Jewish
temperament
also
a
choleric
nature
His
theory
was
that
if
you
couldn
t
do
a
thing
at
first
throw
out
of
the
box
it
was
his
own
dicing
simile
then
you
would
never
do
it
which
is
pure
nonsense
When
he
allowed
me
to
play
an
accom
paniment
to
his
singing
if
the
slightest
slip
or
stumble
occurred
on
my
part
he
would
slap
my
neck
not
softly
and
curse
me
for
a
sloven
He
got
over
this
irritable
precipitancy
with
the
passage
of
the
years
and
his
art
gained
thereby
in
repose
and
mellowness
During
the
last
decade
of
his
life
his
singing
was
a
thing
of
beauty
be
cause
of
its
profound
interpretative
power
and
pene
trating
intensity
A
dynamic
man
He
was
the
first
artist
I
saw
who
borrowed
from
a
music-critic
the
other
way
round
is
the
popular
belief
Max
asked
H
E
Krehbiel
critic
of
the
New
York
Tribune
for
a
five
dollar
bill
He
got
it
His
Cherry
Street
landlord
was
Joshua
Gregg
the
wool-man
Heinrich
owed
a
month
s
rent
Gregg
came
to
collect
it
Max
sang
The
Heart
bowed
down
by
weight
of
woe
and
the
rent
was
re
mitted
by
Gregg
with
tears
in
his
eyes
Oddly
enough
he
was
only
a
Mendelssohn
singer
when
I
first
knew
him
and
the
old
barytone
repertory
Lort
zing
Mozart
Marschner
and
Abt
yes
Swallows
Homeward
Fly
Abt
We
fought
about
the
merits
of
Schubert
and
Schumann
till
he
took
them
up
and
it
wasn
t
long
before
he
was
in
love
with
the
entire
song
literatures
At
a
time
when
Brahms
and
Robert
Franz
were
rather
patronised
by
critics
he
sang
both
with
sympathy
I
always
liked
him
better
than
I
did
George
Henschel
who
also
played
the
piano
or
the
operatic
Franz
Wtillner
Heinrich
on
a
bet
studied
and
played
Chopin
s
E
flat
Polonaise
at
that
time
so
exquisitely
delivered
by
the
crystalline
fingers
of
Rafael
Joseffy
and
he
also
took
up
the
violin
for
a
year
and
played
the
second
violin
in
Haydn
s
D
minor
string
quartet
This
too
on
a
wager
Naturally
I
was
lost
in
the
penumbra
of
this
irresistible
artist
Older
by
ten
years
neverthe
less
he
made
a
companion
of
me
calling
me
a
pale
face
and
reproaching
me
for
not
being
man
enough
to
take
a
drink
once
in
a
while
every
ten
minutes
But
I
was
then
austere
I
had
mapped
out
a
plan
of
study
from
which
plan
I
never
swerved
at
least
for
an
hour
or
two
I
was
a
bit
of
a
prig
I
didn
t
dissolve
in
the
warm
bath
of
these
ill-assorted
personalities
I
pre
ferred
the
companionship
of
Franz
Schubert
a
living
human
not
the
composer
who
was
the
brother
of
Mrs
Heinrich
The
musical
furore
sounded
in
my
skull
I
had
heard
Rubinstein
and
couldn
t
appreciate
him
1873
k
ut
his
Calmuck
features
Beethoven-like
head
and
extravagant
gestures
fascinated
me
His
playing
was
velvet-thunder
that
s
the
fantastic
way
I
described
it
to
myself
Twenty
years
later
when
I
heard
this
giant
at
his
seven
historical
piano
recitals
in
Europe
I
took
his
true
measure
a
heaven-storming
one
Von
Billow
at
the
Academy
and
Annette
Essipova
at
As
sociation
Hall
both
during
the
season
of
1875-1876
filled
me
with
joy
The
magic
brew
began
its
work
Never
had
the
law
seemed
a
drearier
mistress
I
thought
of
nothing
but
piano
technique
my
experiments
in
prestidigitation
were
transposed
from
cards
and
coins
and
the
blossoming
of
conjurer
s
flowers
to
the
key
board
to
Mozart
Haydn
yes
even
to
Carl
Czerny
the
indefatigable
chemist
who
distilled
studies
to
grease
weak
fingers
Max
Heinrich
encouraged
me
My
father
did
not
As
an
experienced
amateur
he
foresaw
loose
company
irregular
hours
and
the
drudgery
of
teaching
He
foresaw
clearly
My
mother
who
had
given
up
all
hope
for
my
priestly
vocation
thought
I
might
become
an
organist
and
play
the
Cathloic
service
Ad
majorem
Dei
gloriam
I
had
studied
piano
with
little
result
when
a
child
and
with
an
old
German
named
Carl
Rudolph
a
hornist
who
had
a
marked
sense
of
rhythm
a
clear
touch
but
no
technique
to
speak
of
on
the
pianoforte
He
could
play
dance
music
well
the
old-fashioned
kind
Strauss
the
elder
Lanner
Diabelli
but
Chopin
was
a
sealed
book
to
him
Once
when
I
presumptuously
played
at
the
Military
Polonaise
the
grey-haired
teacher
shook
his
head
saying
I
don
t
call
that
music
Later
I
went
to
another
pedagogue
but
he
stiffened
my
wrists
and
fingers
and
I
quit
him
besides
magic
held
my
in
terest
then
But
in
1875
was
different
I
heard
the
call
and
obeyed
it
and
have
regretted
doing
so
ever
since
that
is
when
I
look
at
my
bank-book
a
With
Franz
Schubert
I
traversed
the
entire
land
of
literature
for
violin
and
piano
but
my
ambition
excelled
my
technical
ability
I
was
a
fmgersmith
to
be
sure
but
I
needed
a
solid
grounding
in
the
essentials
of
the
art
also
fundamental
brainwork
as
Dante
Gabriel
Rossetti
used
to
say
In
my
predicament
I
went
to
Michael
Cross
and
frankly
asked
him
to
help
me
telling
him
that
later
I
would
pay
him
for
his
in
struction
My
mother
joined
the
conspiracy
my
father
being
kept
in
ignorance
and
soon
I
was
launched
in
mid
stream
as
a
student
of
the
piano
My
music
copy-book
tells
me
the
date
number
of
lessons
also
the
list
of
pieces
undertaken
September
25
1875
I
began
I
ended
May
Beethoven
s
opus
31
No
3
To
take
lessons
I
had
to
be
at
the
Cross
piano
at
six
A
M
He
was
an
early
riser
I
sneaked
out
of
the
house
my
music
hidden
in
my
coat
for
fear
of
meeting
my
father
usually
gone
on
his
busi
ness
before
that
hour
He
was
no
doubt
surprised
at
my
activity
but
never
suspected
the
cause
At
nine
A
M
I
was
at
my
desk
in
the
office
of
Daniel
M
Fox
ready
for
the
transcription
of
some
dull
will
or
deed
of
real
estate
My
leisure
hours
were
devoted
to
music
study
I
got
along
fairly
well
though
I
had
to
unlearn
lots
when
I
went
to
other
masters
Michael
Cross
was
not
modern
in
his
treatment
of
the
piano
furthermore
he
gave
his
pupils
more
Mozart
than
Bach
he
believed
more
in
the
lyric
than
the
polyphonic
He
played
Bach
though
I
never
heard
his
Bach
on
the
organ
Mozart
was
his
passion
and
an
admirable
passion
it
is
but
his
pupils
suffered
for
want
of
variety
just
as
the
Roth
scholars
suffered
from
too
much
Latin
Jarvis
should
have
been
my
teacher
He
began
with
Hummel
and
Bach
He
believed
in
a
sound
technical
apparatus
then
the
music
if
you
had
any
in
you
would
take
care
of
itself
Cross
practised
the
reverse
Music
first
tech
nique
afterwards
all
very
well
for
a
finished
artist
but
hampering
to
a
student
Once
when
I
had
played
Men
delssohn
s
Rondo
Capriccioso
too
glibly
he
put
me
on
a
simpler
diet
and
banished
finger-studies
Since
then
I
have
gone
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
swallowed
too
many
technical
studies
with
consequent
digital
indiges
tion
When
you
study
piano
study
with
a
pianist
Michael
was
not
a
specialist
I
remember
Theodore
Thomas
telling
me
years
later
that
he
found
the
choral
bodies
trained
by
Cross
remiss
as
to
attack
intonation
and
rhythmic
sense
all
of
which
may
have
been
an
ill
tempered
slur
of
the
great
conductor
Time
fugued
by
I
became
a
slacker
as
far
as
the
law
was
concerned
I
was
always
at
the
heels
of
Max
Hein
rich
or
playing
the
bass
in
piano
duos
Mrs
Heinrich
taking
the
treble
Musically
I
owe
much
to
that
amia
ble
and
estimable
woman
And
I
closely
hugged
the
neighbourhood
where
I
might
hear
Mr
Jarvis
play
or
the
Cross
string
quartet
There
were
summer
nights
when
I
leaned
out
of
my
window
longing
for
music
I
could
hear
the
soft
strains
from
the
back
garden
we
were
removed
from
the
Cross
music
room
by
two
houses
and
I
dreamed
and
yearned
as
only
a
lad
love-sick
with
art
can
yearn
Life
stretched
like
a
lyric
ray
of
moonlight
paving
the
silvery
waters
of
the
future
Nothing
seemed
impossible
All
was
permitted
I
felt
an
invincible
force
within
my
veins
the
swelling
sap
Ah
Youth
is
immortal
But
youth
can
t
always
foot
the
bills
My
father
had
to
The
secret
came
out
and
he
promptly
paid
my
three
years
tuition
without
grum
bling
Michael
was
a
life-long
friend
a
lover
of
engrav
ings
too
and
on
his
walls
hung
several
masterpieces
gifts
from
my
father
A
cultivated
man
Mr
Cross
the
owner
of
a
well-assorted
library
in
which
I
browsed
for
years
and
a
man
who
attracted
friends
indeed
he
was
the
object
of
friendships
rather
than
friendly
him
self
He
was
self-contained
frigid
at
times
but
could
unbutton
in
the
seclusion
of
his
music-study
A
high
liver
he
held
the
championship
for
disposing
of
edibles
and
liquids
The
late
Dennis
McGowan
then
at
San
som
and
Fifteenth
Streets
told
me
that
when
Michael
Cross
was
in
his
prime
he
would
open
a
hundred
and
odd
oysters
for
him
at
a
sitting
and
saw
them
washed
down
with
tankards
and
tankards
of
musty
But
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
he
was
a
huge
man
physically
not
so
monstrous
in
size
as
Billy
Ware
but
of
a
Brobding
nagian
presence
and
capacity
I
envied
him
then
I
envy
him
now
Apart
from
his
annual
attack
of
gout
no
one
ever
saw
him
the
worse
for
all
this
With
a
punc
tuality
that
was
chronic
he
occupied
his
organ
bench
in
the
choir
of
the
Cathedral
and
often
played
so
expres
sively
after
High
Mass
that
my
mother
would
say
to
me
Michael
played
as
if
inspired
to-day
and
when
I
repeated
this
he
would
reply
his
eye
twinkling
Yes
at
Van
Hook
s
last
night
He
didn
t
mean
to
be
cynical
nor
was
he
a
materialist
but
he
knew
the
law
of
metabol
ism
He
knew
that
rich
food
and
fermented
drink
was
a
nourishment
that
might
be
transmuted
into
beautiful
sounds
by
accomplished
musicians
Plain
living
and
high
thinking
is
well
enough
for
saints
or
philosophers
but
not
for
sinners
or
singers
The
Van
Hook
he
referred
to
had
a
restaurant
at
the
northeast
corner
of
Twentieth
and
Tower
Streets
It
had
a
wide
vogue
The
proprietor
was
a
handsome
blond
man
hospitable
as
the
night
was
long
and
a
famous
contriver
of
mixed
drinks
But
the
glory
of
the
place
was
the
cooking
of
Mrs
Billy
Van
Hook
then
a
fair-haired
blue-eyed
young
matron
with
a
fried
oyster
technique
only
second
to
Finelli
s
down
Chestnut
Street
There
were
some
connoisseurs
who
preferred
the
Van
Hook
interpretation
Her
chicken
and
lobster
salads
her
deviled
crabs
were
masterpieces
in
miniature
It
was
not
alone
the
artistic
and
musical
crowd
that
patronised
the
Van
Hooks
club
men
from
Walnut
Street
found
their
way
to
the
little
restaurant
those
dashing
young
bucks
Jack
McFadden
and

the
rest

He
never
had
the
reputation
for
terrapin
enjoyed
by
McGowan
or
Augustine
but
Michael
Cross
always
swore
that
his
most
malignant
gout
was
developed
by
Mrs
Van
Hook
s
terrapin
You
must
not
suppose
that

and
I
were
intimately
admitted
in
the
sacred
circle
we
were
happy
witnesses
contemporaries
I
as
a
pupil
of
Cross
Franz
as
a
brother-in-law
of
Heinrich
But
it
was
no
Barmecide
s
feast
for
us
We
swallowed
real
food
and
drink
while
our
seniors
swallowed
theirs
and
we
saw
some
strange
doings

casionally

may
add
that

has
her

in
a
restaurant
bearing
her
name
behind

Custom
House
where
the
oysters
are
fried
under
her
surveillance
and
where
tell
it
not
in
Gath
or
Gotham
they
taste
as
they
did
forty
years
ago
After
that
don
t
speak
to
me
about
time
its
whirligigs
and
caprices
Strange
to
say
despite
his
marked
dramatic
aptitude
and
personality
Max
Heinrich
was
not
a
success
as
an
operatic
singer
He
was
a
member
of
the
Metropolitan
Opera
Company
New
York
for
several
seasons
I
think
1887-1888
perhaps
earlier
but
with
the
exception
of
a
fairly
good
characterisation
of
the
Night
Watch
man
in
The
Mastersingers
and
other
minor
roles
he
did
not
shine
in
comparison
with
such
acting-singers
as
Emil
Fischer
Robinson
von
Milde
or
the
mighty
Albert
Niemann
His
art
was
essentially
intimate
and
destined
for
the
smaller
spaces
of
the
concert
stage
and
not
for
the
broader
key
of
fresco-painting
which
is
the
operatic
But
give
him
a
grand
piano
a
sympathetic
audience
and
he
could
make
you
forget
all
the
gauds
and
chicaneries
of
opera
and
the
inartistic
bellowing
of
opera-singers
He
was
a
rare
artist
Heinrich
and
it
is
a
peculiar
satis
faction
to
his
friends
that
his
mantle
has
fallen
on
the
shoulders
of
his
daughter
Julia
Heinrich
soprano
born
in
Philadelphia
educated
by
her
father
an
opera-singer
in
New
York
as
well
as
on
the
continent
but
a
concert
singer
born
She
is
vocally
better
equipped
than
was
her
father
she
has
his
musical
memory
and
the
special
art
of
accompaniment
In
the
latter
art
he
drilled
me
for
years
and
even
to-day
when
I
support
a
singer
at
the
piano
I
have
a
freezing
sensation
on
the
nape
of
my
neck
It
is
the
functioning
of
my
memory-cells
through
association
of
ideas
My
neck
remembers
the
slaps
ad
ministered
by
Max
as
he
sang
making
an
occasional
parenthesis
such
as
Chim
verdammte
Esel
why
don
t
you
keep
time
And
the
damnable
ass
would
bow
his
head
to
the
anticipated
blow
It
never
failed
to
register
I
have
taken
some
pains
to
describe
the
man
and
my
admiration
for
him
Yet
such
is
the
irony
of
the
years
the
last
time
I
saw
him
several
months
before
his
death
and
in
company
with
Julia
Heinrich
we
disputed
like
a
pair
of
old
fools
over
trifling
data
He
had
the
rather
unusual
weakness
of
pretending
to
be
older
than
he
was
and
he
persisted
in
treating
me
as
a
child
no
older
than
I
was
in
1876
childish
withal
we
called
each
other
familiar
though
not
complimentary
names
I
was
again
Chim
the
Esel
and
secretly
I
was
scared
There
was
fire
in
the
eye
of
the
old
war-horse
The
extinct
volcano
spouted
again
I
was
glad
to
see
such
vitality
He
said
he
was
seventy-two
years
of
age
he
was
only
sixty-six
I
told
him
so
He
called
me
a
liar
The
joke
was
that
his
New
York
friends
and
admirers
gave
him
an
elaborate
dinner
on
his
seventieth
birthday
I
asked
him
why
He
couldn
t
help
smiling
His
daughter
smiled
We
all
smiled
And
that
s
the
last
I
saw
of
Max
Heinrich
in
the
flesh
He
was
one
of
the
formative
in
fluences
in
my
irregular
life
Wild
as
he
was
he
steadied
me
not
because
I
took
him
as
an
example
to
be
avoided
as
my
mother
said
I
should
and
as
I
did
in
the
case
of
George
Woodward
Wickersham
whose
concentration
had
something
inhuman
about
it
If
Sam
would
only
take
a
drink
or
smoke
a
pipe
his
uncle
would
despair
ingly
exclaim
but
because
Heinrich
embodied
all
I
admired
as
an
interpretative
artist
I
dissociated
the
man
from
the
singer
He
dragged
me
with
him
every
where
to
the
choir
of
the
Cathedral
to
the
Broad
Street
Shool
where
I
first
heard
the
magnificent
Hebrew
cantillations
which
coming
from
an
antique
civilisa
tion
Egypt
filtered
through
the
ages
to
the
ritual
of
Mother
Church
an
echo
may
be
found
in
our
Plain
Chant
MY
FRIENDS
THE
JEWS
How
shall
we
sing
the
Lord
s
song
in
a
strange
land
I
couldn
t
help
recalling
these
words
of
the
Psalmist
these
and
the
opening
By
the
rivers
of
Babylon
in
which
is
compressed
the
immemorial
melancholy
of
an
enslaved
race
when
I
heard
Sophie
Braslau
intone
with
her
luscious
contralto
a
touching
Hebrew
lament
Eili
Eili
lomo
asovtoni
at
a
con
cert
Naturally
I
believed
the
melody
to
be
the
echo
of
some
tribal
chant
sung
in
the
days
of
the
Babylonian
captivity
and
perhaps
before
that
in
the
time
of
the
prehistoric
Sumerians
and
the
epic
of
Gilgamesh
Others
have
made
the
same
error
Judge
of
my
surprise
when
in
a
copy
of
The
American
Jewish
News
I
read
that
the
composer
of
Eili
Eili
is
living
that
his
name
is
Jacob
Kopel
Sandier
that
he
wrote
the
music
for
a
historical
drama
Die
B
ne
Moishe
The
Sons
of
Moses
which
deals
with
the
Chinese
Jews
Mr
Sandier
had
composed
the
song
for
Sophie
Carp
a
Yiddish
actress
and
singer
The
Sons
of
Moses
was
a
failure
and
a
new
piece
Broche
the
Jewish
King
of
Poland
was
pre
pared
Not
alluding
to
Pan
Dmowski
It
was
pro
duced
at
the
Windsor
Theatre
in
the
Bowery
The
song
not
the
play
was
a
success
Then
the
music
drifted
into
queer
company
for
music
is
a
living
organism
and
wanders
when
it
is
not
controlled
Finally
Sophie
Bras
lau
got
hold
of
it
and
the
composer
who
was
directing
a
choir
in
a
Bronx
synagogue
was
astounded
to
hear
of
the
acclamations
of
a
Metropolitan
Opera
House
Sunday
night
audience
His
daughter
had
listened
to
Eili
Eili
and
brought
home
the
good
news
After
troublesome
preliminaries
Meyer
Beer
the
pen-name
of
the
musical
editor
of
The
American
Jewish
News
was
able
to
prove
beyond
peradventure
of
a
doubt
the
ar
tistic
parentage
of
the
song
and
Jacob
Sandier
is
in
a
fair
way
of
being
idolised
in
his
community
as
he
should
be
Eili
Eili
lomo
asovtoni
may
be
found
in
Psalm
English
version
the
words
of
David
are
in
the
first
verse
My
God
my
God
why
has
thou
forsaken
me
And
in
St
Mark
s
gospel
we
read
And
at
the
ninth
hour
Jesus
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
Eloi
Eloi
lama
sabachthani
which
is
being
interpreted
My
God
my
God
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
gt
gt
chapter
15
verse
have
made
of
this
immortal
phrase
a
bone
of
theological
contention
Schmiedel
who
with
Harnack
believes
the
words
to
have
been
uttered
by
our
Saviour
nevertheless
points
out
various
details
which
prefigure
the
same
things
in
the
crucifixion
the
just
man
hanging
on
the
stake
the
perforated
hands
and
feet
the
mocking
crowd
the
sol
diers
gambling
for
the
clothes
everything
takes
place
as
described
in
the
Psalm
Lublinski
in
Dogma
p
93
and
Arthur
Drews
in
The
Historicity
of
Jesus
p
Harnack
and
Schmiedel
A
beloved
master
the
late
Solomon
Schechter
disposed
of
the
question
in
his
usual
open
style
The
world
is
big
enough
he
has
said
to
me
for
both
Jehovah
and
Jesus
for
two
such
grand
faiths
as
the
Hebrew
and
the
Christian
But
he
saw
Christianity
only
in
its
historical
sequence
and
not
as
a
continuator
of
Judaism
rather
a
branching
away
from
the
main
trunk
If
it
had
not
been
for
Constan
tine
the
world
might
be
worshipping
Mithra
to-day
was
the
erudite
and
worthy
man
s
belief
Enveloped
in
the
mists
of
the
first
two
centuries
Christianity
seems
to
have
had
a
narrow
escape
from
the
doctrines
of
Mithraism
That
Salomon
Reinach
practically
admits
in
his
Or
pheus
a
most
significant
study
of
comparative
relig
ions
from
the
pen
of
this
French
savant
Once
upon
a
time
I
played
the
organ
in
a
shool
a
reformed
not
an
orthodox
synagogue
played
indiffer
ently
well
But
my
acquaintance
with
the
Jewish
liturgy
dates
back
to
my
boyhood
in
Philadelphia
where
I
studied
Hebrew
in
company
with
Latin
The
reason
My
mother
fondly
hoped
that
I
might
become
a
priest
the
very
thought
of
which
makes
me
shudder
now
The
religious
in
me
found
vent
in
music
and
my
love
of
change
was
gratified
by
playing
the
Hebrew
service
on
Shabbas
Saturday
and
the
Roman
Catholic
on
our
Sabbath
Probably
that
is
why
I
was
affected
by
Sophie
Braslau
s
singing
of
Eili
Eili
I
have
always
entertained
a
peculiar
admiration
for
the
Jews
and
Judaism
It
began
with
the
study
of
Semitic
literature
of
the
Talmud
above
all
of
Hebrew
poetry
the
most
sublime
in
any
language
as
Matthew
Arnold
asserts
in
his
comparative
estimate
of
Greek
and
Hebraic
cultures
My
dearest
friends
have
been
still
are
of
that
race
Prejudice
social
or
political
against
the
Jew
I
not
only
detest
but
I
have
never
been
able
to
comprehend
My
early
playmates
were
Jewish
boys
and
girls
I
have
stood
under
the
Choopah
mar
riage
canopy
and
have
seen
many
a
Bar-Mitzvah
even
sat
Shivah
for
the
dead
father
of
intimate
friends
From
Rafael
Joseffy
to
Georg
Brandes
from
the
bril
liant
Hungarian
virtuoso
that
was
Joseffy
whose
father
a
learned
rabbi
I
visited
at
Budapest
in
Pest-Ofen
in
with
twenty-six
languages
ancient
and
modern
at
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
Professor
Brandes
the
Danish
scholar
an
intellectual
giant
and
a
critic
in
the
direct
line
of
Sainte-Beuve
and
Taine
both
men
I
knew
and
loved
Whether
the
Jew
has
attained
the
summits
as
a
creator
in
the
Seven
Arts
I
can
not
speak
authoritatively
although
the
Old
Testament
furnishes
abundant
evidences
that
he
has
in
poetry
Disraeli
Beaconsfield
who
liked
to
tease
Gladstone
by
calling
him
Frohstein
and
pointing
to
his
rugged
Jewish
prophet
s
features
has
written
of
his
race
most
eloquently
I
should
like
to
quote
a
pas
sage
in
its
entirety
time
and
space
forbid
But
an
excerpt
I
permit
myself
the
luxury
of
reproducing
The
ear
the
voice
the
fancy
teeming
with
combina
tions
the
inspiration
fervid
with
picture
and
emotion
that
came
from
Caucasus
and
which
we
have
preserved
unpolluted
have
endowed
us
with
almost
the
exclusive
privilege
of
music
that
science
of
harmonious
sounds
which
the
ancients
recognise
as
most
divine
and
deified
in
the
person
of
their
most
beautiful
creation
He
goes
on
There
is
not
a
company
of
singers
not
an
orchestra
in
a
single
capital
that
is
not
crowded
with
our
children
under
feigned
names
which
they
adopt
to
conciliate
the
dark
aversion
which
your
posterity
will
some
day
disclaim
with
shame
and
disgust
Lord
Beaconsfield
mentions
Rossini
Meyerbeer
Men
delssohn
as
Jewish
composers
and
Pasta
and
Grisi
among
the
singers
Probably
he
had
not
heard
Rossini
s
witti
cism
uttered
on
his
deathbed
For
heaven
s
sake
don
t
bury
me
in
the
Jewish
cemetery
Nor
did
Beacons
field
look
far
enough
ahead
when
he
wrote
dark
aver
sion
which
phrase
is
wonderful
To-day
the
boot
is
on
the
other
leg
It
may
be
Gentiles
who
will
be
forced
to
change
their
names
to
Jewish
I
could
easily
sign
my
self
Shamus
Hanuchah
leaving
out
the
lichts
or
pattern
after
the
name
Paderewski
jokingly
wrote
on
his
photograph
For
Jacob
Hunekerstein
And
I
am
ashamed
to
confess
that
I
know
Jews
who
themselves
are
ashamed
of
having
been
born
Jews
Incredible
In
Vienna
I
have
seen
St
Stefan
s
Cathedral
crowded
at
the
u
o
clock
High
Mass
by
most
fervent
worshippers
the
majority
of
whom
seemed
Semitic
which
prompted
me
to
propound
the
riddle
When
is
a
Jew
not
a
Jew
Answer
When
he
is
a
Roman
Catholic
in
Vienna
But
you
never
can
tell
As
Joseffy
used
to
say
when
some
musician
with
a
nose
like
the
Ten
Com
mandments
was
introduced
as
for
example
Monsieur
Fontaine
He
means
Brunnen
or
in
Hebrew
Pischa
He
is
not
a
Jew
but
his
grandmother
wore
a
scheitel
the
wig
still
worn
by
orthodox
Jewish
women
The
truth
is
that
among
the
virtuosi
singers
actors
the
Jew
holds
first
place
Liszt
and
Paganini
are
the
exceptions
and
Paganini
could
easily
pass
in
an
east-side
crowd
as
Jehudah
As
to
the
Wagner
controversy
not
started
by
Nietzsche
but
by
Rossini
and
Meyerbeer
who
referred
to
Wagner
as
Jewish
that
was
settled
by
O
G
Sonneck
in
his
little
book
Was
Wagner
a
Jew
but
only
after
I
had
introduced
to
the
columns
of
The
New
York
Times
Sunday
Magazine
in
1913
a
book
by
Otto
Bournot
en
titled
Ludwig
Geyer
Geyer
was
as
you
may
remem
her
the
stepfather
of
Richard
Wagner
Bournot
had
access
to
the
Baireuth
archives
and
delved
into
the
newspapers
of
Geyer
s
days
August
Bottiger
s
Nec
rology
had
hitherto
been
the
chief
source
Mary
Bur
rell
s
Life
of
Wagner
was
the
first
to
give
the
true
spelling
of
the
name
of
Wagner
s
mother
which
was
Bertz
which
may
be
Jewish
or
German
as
you
like
The
Geyers
as
far
back
as
1700
were
pious
folk
The
first
of
the
family
mentioned
in
local
history
was
a
cer
tain
Benjamin
Geyer
who
about
1700
was
a
trombone
player
and
organist
Indeed
the
Geyers
were
largely
connected
with
the
Evangelical
Church
Ludwig
Geyer
virtually
acknowledged
by
Baireuth
as
the
real
father
of
Richard
Wagner
looked
Jewish
which
proves
nothing
as
I
have
seen
dark
Semitic
fisher-folk
on
the
coast
of
Galway
and
displayed
Jewish
versatility
For
that
matter
the
composer
von
Weber
looked
like
a
Jew
as
does
Camille
Saint-Saens
When
I
ventured
to
write
of
this
racial
trait
much
more
marked
in
his
youth
the
French
composer
sent
me
a
denial
sarcastically
ask
ing
how
a
man
with
such
a
holy
51
name
as
Saint
Saens
could
be
Jewish
But
Leopold
Godowsky
who
was
intimate
with
him
told
me
that
he
took
his
mother
s
name
As
to
Wagner
a
little
story
may
suffice
In
1896
I
attended
the
Wagner
festival
at
Baireuth
Between
performances
I
tramped
the
Franconian
hills
My
toes
hurt
Looking
for
a
corn-cutter
I
found
one
not
far
from
the
Wagner
house
The
old
chap
seated
me
in
his
doorway
probably
to
get
better
light
and
as
he
crouched
over
my
feet
in
the
street
I
asked
him
if
he
had
known
Richard
Wagner
Know
Wag
ner
he
irascibly
replied
He
passed
my
shop
every
day
Many
the
times
I
cut
his
corns
Oh
no
not
here
over
yonder
he
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
Wahnfried
I
inquired
what
kind
of
a
looking
man
was
Wagner
He
was
a
little
bow-legged
Jew
and
he
always
wore
a
long
cloak
to
hide
his
crooked
legs
Enfm
the
truth
from
the
mouth
of
babes
This
beats
Nietzsche
and
his
Vulture
Geyer
Not
religion
not
nationality
but
race
counts
in
the
individual
Wagner
looked
like
a
Jew
And
there
are
many
red-haired
Jews
with
pug
noses
and
light
blue
eyes
Renan
in
Le
Judaisme
has
shown
us
how
non
Jewish
elements
were
in
the
course
of
time
incorporated
within
the
race
The
Chazars
of
Eastern
Europe
are
Jews
only
a
thousand
years
old
Dr
Brandes
in
a
confession
of
his
views
on
the
subject
has
said
in
The
Journal
Jor
Jewish
History
and
Literature
published
at
Stockholm
Tei
dscript
for
Judisk
Historia
and
quoted
by
Bernard
G
Richards
in
a
capital
study
of
Brandes
from
the
fifteenth
to
the
sixteenth
year
of
my
life
I
regarded
Judaism
purely
as
a
religion
But
when
he
was
abused
as
a
Jew
then
Georg
Brandes
felt
himself
a
genuine
Jew
Many
a
man
has
found
himself
in
a
similar
position
Atavistic
impulses
submerged
may
explain
why
certain
men
Gentiles
scholars
by
nature
noncombatants
have
left
their
peaceful
study
jeopardised
their
life
ruined
their
reputation
to
battle
for
an
obscure
Jew
Dreyfus
Zola
of
Greek-Levantine
origin
perhaps
Italian
and
Jew
was
one
of
those
valiant
souls
who
fought
for
the
truth
Ana
tole
France
born
Thibault
another
Count
Thibault
at
the
time
of
the
Dreyfus
uproar
challenged
the
great
writer
who
signs
himself
Anatole
France
to
prove
his
right
to
that
distinguished
Roman
Catholic
name
That
the
gentle
Anatole
is
the
very
spit
and
spawn
of
a
Jew
as
appear
ance
goes
that
since
Heine
baptised
a
Christian
no
such
union
of
mocking
irony
and
tender
poetic
emo
tion
can
be
noted
in
the
work
of
any
writer
are
alike
valueless
as
testimony
Nevertheless
many
believe
in
this
Hebraic
strain
just
as
they
feel
it
in
the
subtlety
of
Cardinal
Newman
s
writing
he
was
of
Dutch
stock
and
in
the
humour
of
Charles
Lamb
Both
Englishmen
are
authoritatively
accredited
with
the
precious
quintes
sence
as
Du
Maurier
would
say
I
have
stood
a
lot
of
good-natured
fun
poked
at
me
for
my
Jewish
propensity
I
can
stand
it
as
there
is
a
solid
substratum
of
history
for
my
speculations
Some
years
ago
The
Contemporary
Review
printed
an
article
entitled
The
Jew
in
Music
with
this
motto
from
Oscar
Wilde
s
Salome
The
Jews
believe
only
in
what
they
can
not
see
The
writer
s
name
was
signed
A
E
Keeton
Not
even
the
assertion
that
Beethoven
was
a
Belgian
is
half
so
iconoclastic
as
some
of
the
as
sumptions
made
in
this
study
When
Mozart
first
appeared
as
a
prodigy
before
the
future
Queen
of
France
Marie
Antoinette
she
announced
that
a
genius
must
not
be
a
Jew
The
original
name
Ozart
was
changed
Mozart
was
baptised
Which
anecdote
makes
the
scalp
to
freeze
though
not
because
of
its
verisimilitude
Bee
thoven
and
Rubinstein
looked
alike
ergo
But
then
they
didn
t
In
the
case
of
Chopin
he
was
certainly
Jewish-looking
especially
in
the
Winterhalter
and
Kwiatowski
portraits
His
father
came
from
Nancy
in
Lorraine
thickly
populated
by
Jews
The
original
name
Szopen
or
Szop
is
Jewish
His
music
especially
the
first
Scherzo
in
B
minor
has
a
Heine-like
irony
and
irony
is
a
prime
characteristic
of
the
Chosen
or
Choosing
as
Zangwill
puts
it
race
But
all
this
is
in
the
key
of
wildest
surmise
Wagner
was
born
in
the
ghetto
at
i
7
o
STEEPLEJACK
Leipsic
yet
that
didn
t
make
him
Jewish
any
more
than
the
baptism
of
Mendelssohn
made
him
Christian
Georges
Bizet
was
of
Jewish
origin
he
looked
Jewish
but
the
fact
that
he
married
the
daughter
of
Halevy
Ha-Levi
the
composer
of
La
Juive
didn
t
make
the
composer
of
Carmen
a
Jew
Neither
religion
nor
na
tionality
are
more
than
superficial
factors
in
the
na
ture
of
men
and
women
Race
alone
counts
Once
upon
a
time
I
wrote
a
Jewish
story
The
Shofar
Blew
at
Sunset
Maggie
Cline
liked
it
so
did
Israel
Zangwill
I
preserve
a
letter
from
Mr
Zangwill
telling
me
of
his
liking
The
story
appeared
in
M
lie
New
York
now
defunct
It
was
afterwards
translated
into
Yid
dish
though
it
did
not
give
general
satisfaction
in
either
camp
Jewish
or
Christian
It
revelled
in
the
cantilla
tions
and
employed
as
leading
motive
the
Shofar
or
ram
s-horn
blown
in
the
synagogues
on
Yom
Kippur
or
the
Day
of
Atonement
The
scroll
of
the
Torah
also
appeared
But
these
liturgical
references
didn
t
offend
it
was
my
surprising
denunciation
of
Jewish
materialism
in
New
York
that
proved
the
rock
of
offence
I
say
sur
prising
for
what
is
a
Christian-born
doing
in
another
field
and
finding
fault
I
m
sure
I
can
t
say
why
un
less
that
in
writing
the
tale
I
unconsciously
dramatised
myself
as
a
reproaching
voice
There
was
much
in
my
strictures
of
that
son
of
Hanan
who
prowled
through
the
streets
of
the
Holy
City
in
the
year
A
D
62
crying
aloud
Woe
woe
upon
Jerusalem
I
remember
that
I
predicted
because
of
the
luxury
of
the
American
Jew
lofty
Jewish
idealism
might
be
submerged
in
a
flood
of
indifference
and
disbelief
Prosperity
would
prove
the
snag
In
the
heart
of
the
Jew
is
the
true
Zion
not
in
success
nor
in
some
far-away
land
Naturally
that
didn
t
please
the
Zionists
One
professional
Jewish
jour
nal
said
that
I
preached
like
a
rabbi
Reb
but
thought
like
a
goi
The
word
Chutzpah
was
also
used
Yet
wasn
t
I
right
It
is
the
spiritual
Ark
of
the
Covenant
the
spirit
of
the
law
and
not
the
letter
that
killeth
which
should
be
enshrined
in
the
heart
of
the
Jew
He
may
dream
of
Palestine
of
its
skies
of
the
few
large
stars
a
land
overflowing
with
milk
and
honey
but
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
it
is
the
living
God
to
whom
he
must
go
for
spiritual
sustenance
God
the
eternal
reservoir
of
our
earthly
certitudes
Schma
Ysroel
And
now
for
fear
that
all
this
sounds
more
like
a
ser
mon
than
a
sonnet
and
I
m
in
earnest
not
forgetting
that
the
lofty
ethics
of
the
Old
Testament
apply
quite
as
much
to
Christians
as
to
Jews
I
ll
conclude
with
the
statement
that
the
most
Jewish
composer
I
know
of
bar
none
is
Ernest
Bloch
a
Swiss
musician
residing
in
New
York
City
He
has
great
gifts
abundant
science
and
an
inborn
sense
of
orchestral
colour
and
rhythms
I
heard
him
conduct
a
concert
at
Philadelphia
entirely
devoted
to
his
own
works
I
shall
not
soon
forget
the
emotional
impression
created
by
his
Solomon
for
violoncello
solo
and
orchestra
interpreted
on
the
solo
instrument
by
that
splendid
young
artist
Hans
Kindler
the
first
cellist
of
the
Philadelphia
Orchestra
It
is
a
masterpiece
But
the
concert
was
too
long
there
were
colour
and
sentiment
that
cloyed
and
the
beat
of
the
composer-conductor
was
not
propulsive
With
Leopold
Stokowski
things
would
have
gone
at
a
brisker
tempo
and
would
have
been
charged
with
more
vitality
As
the
final
note
was
sounded
a
well-known
wit
and
jurist
a
Hebrew
if
I
say
more
Philadelphia
will
surely
recognise
the
man
passed
into
the
lobby
of
the
Academy
of
Music
He
sighed
He
said
with
the
self-mocking
irony
of
his
race
Beautiful
music
but
another
afternoon
like
this
and
I
ll
turn
anti
Semite
Selah
THE
GIRLS
Race
or
religion
never
troubled
me
Music
was
be
come
my
sole
passion
I
even
ceased
to
envy
Heide
Norris
his
tailor
Williams
Carter
his
good
looks
I
fre
quented
places
where
musicians
gathered
much
to
my
mother
s
disdain
Not
that
I
was
dissipated
I
had
to
sow
my
wild-oats
after
my
own
fashion
My
liquid
measure
as
they
say
at
the
grocer
s
was
the
envy
of
the
gaugers
My
father
who
refused
to
see
me
in
any
but
a
humorous
light
had
called
me
hollow-legs
changed
that
title
for
copper-lined
He
classed
me
as
a
human
armoured
tank
It
was
not
flattering
to
a
young
man
with
a
thirst
for
the
infinite
I
was
always
thirsty
and
moistened
my
clay
and
my
wits
with
equal
facility
I
asked
him
whether
whisky
wasn
t
more
harmful
than
beer
His
reply
was
prompt
Beer
is
bellywash
dear
old
Kensington
phrase
and
in
my
day
gentlemen
didn
t
drink
whisky
they
drank
brandy
I
shuddered
It
was
true
During
the
first
half
of
the
last
century
cognac
was
preferred
to
corn-whisky
by
people
of
taste
But
to
my
way
of
thinking
both
are
poisonous
I
have
mentioned
Williams
Carter
as
one
of
the
beaux
I
must
not
forget
those
other
beauty-men
Dr
John
Taylor
or
Dr
Thomas
H
Fenton
Greek
of
profile
and
admired
of
the
belles
who
promenaded
Spruce
and
Walnut
Streets
Ernest
Law
was
considered
by
feminine
judges
to
be
a
model
of
manly
form
and
later
Barclay
Warburton
entered
the
Greek
God
class
And
there
were
danc
ing
Willie
White
Charlie
Sloan
and
how
many
Binneys
and
Biddies
The
girls
I
was
an
onlooker
with
an
eye
on
the
Burton
girls
Sallie
and
Carrie
the
Junoesque
Bessie
Tunison
and
the
much-admired
Eloise
Conover
or
the
handsome
Burrows
sisters
our
cousins
The
Carter
girls
were
distinguished-looking
in
the
indolent
Italian
style
and
there
was
the
gypsy
beauty
Lizzie
Evans
on
Walnut
Street
below
Tenth
and
a
slender
girl
with
large
unfathomable
eyes
incessant
eyes
as
poet
Vance
Thompson
calls
them
hair
that
Titian
would
have
gloated
over
and
features
that
may
be
seen
in
a
Greek
medallion
I
only
remember
that
her
last
name
was
English
and
that
I
worshipped
her
from
afar
the
desire
of
the
stone
for
the
star
If
I
could
remember
her
first
name
I
might
give
vent
to
another
of
my
emotional
shrieks
Bertha
Elaine
Molly
Bawn
and
the
rest
La
crise
juponniere
had
definitely
declared
itself
Music
was
but
an
accomplice
of
the
petticoats
and
during
my
seventeenth
year
not
sweet
but
simply
seventeen
the
female
planet
arose
on
the
rim
of
my
soul
and
shone
serenely
into
my
agitated
consciousness
Calf-love
had
begun
its
silly
sway
I
have
said
that
love
is
lucid
folly
but
it
is
fascinating
folly
in
the
first
quarter
of
its
honey
noon
And
no
matter
the
fun
poked
at
the
awkward
age
there
is
no
denying
the
single-heartedness
of
a
boy
s
first
love
A
girl
is
a
madonna
in
his
eyes
A
jest
made
about
her
turns
his
little
sky
black
Nor
does
it
have
to
be
a
girl
a
married
woman
will
do
married
women
are
usually
the
target
for
boyish
adoration
I
remember
one
wedded
lady
whom
I
had
honoured
with
my
timid
attentions
I
could
never
follow
Stendhal
s
advice
a
trooper
s
motto
and
make
love
to
every
woman
I
happened
to
find
alone
She
was
mysterious
Ah
how
youth
enjoys
mystery
and
she
impressed
me
as
having
married
her
husband
as
an
accomplice
in
some
dark
enterprise
Perhaps
she
had
He
was
far
from
being
the
hateful
husband
brute
of
fiction
To
me
he
was
quite
affable
till
one
after
noon
as
we
drank
tea
I
heard
him
ask
the
housemaid
if
that
lightning-bug
was
with
his
wife
I
never
went
back
to
her
I
don
t
mind
abuse
but
the
implication
of
the
lantern
and
its
location
you
have
studied
en
tomology
was
too
much
But
there
were
plenty
of
consolations
Bessie
and
Sallie
and
Adele
sweetest
of
girls
who
taught
me
how
to
walk
talk
but
not
to
dance
I
was
born
with
a
Quaker
foot
I
often
wonder
what
girls
see
in
hobbledehoys
They
are
I
know
a
continual
source
of
amusement
I
was
My
dancing
gave
great
pleasure
to
the
children
but
as
I
could
tinkle
pretty
tunes
for
others
to
foot
the
mazy
dance
I
was
occasionally
rewarded
with
a
bright
look
Kissing
was
never
at
tempted
I
contend
that
a
boy
s
mind
at
a
certain
period
is
as
pure
as
a
girl
s
A
pure
girl
of
course
Youth
is
pure
just
because
it
is
youth
says
Dostoievsky
Vague
desires
assail
him
at
which
he
blushes
but
for
unadul
terated
chivalry
give
me
the
average
lad
who
blushes
when
his
mother
tells
him
Mamie
is
coming
over
to-night
Jack
hurry
wash
your
face
and
don
t
forget
to
change
your
collar
Forget
to
change
his
collar
Wash
his
face
forsooth
With
a
Byronic
scowl
which
is
not
missed
by
his
sympathetic
mother
and
sneered
at
by
his
cynical
aunt
he
stalks
out
of
the
room
and
for
a
full
hour
faces
his
glass
alternately
admiring
and
dis
trusting
his
pulchritude
The
boy
who
doesn
t
make
an
ass
of
himself
over
a
girl
is
apt
to
miss
out
later
in
his
manhood
It
meant
something
the
toga
virilis
of
the
Romans
at
once
a
symbol
of
virility
and
sex-initiation
But
no
love
is
comparable
to
the
first
love
of
a
boy
for
his
mother
It
is
the
greatest
romance
in
the
world
It
comes
earlier
with
some
lads
than
others
and
it
lasts
till
his
death
My
affection
took
a
peculiar
turn
I
realised
that
the
end
of
mankind
was
death
We
are
all
condemned
as
Victor
Hugo
said
but
not
our
mothers
I
was
sure
that
my
mother
would
never
die
She
was
something
so
exquisite
that
she
was
deathless
and
like
the
child
in
Wordsworth
s
poem
I
could
have
obstinately
repeated
We
are
seven
when
I
argued
the
matter
with
boys
of
my
age
Their
mothers
might
die
mine
never
The
illusion
long
endured
I
shall
never
forget
the
afternoon
that
I
climbed
to
the
base
of
the
dome
of
the
Cathedral
on
Logan
Square
From
a
window
I
saw
my
mother
s
terrified
face
as
I
triumphantly
waved
a
handkerchief
I
felt
like
Ibsen
s
Master
Builder
in
the
tragic
play
I
was
true
Steeplejack
In
the
mean
time
my
brother
John
without
any
fuss
or
feathers
calmly
ascended
the
dome
by
a
small
ladder
invisible
from
the
street
to
the
gilded
globe
and
cross
at
the
very
top
He
had
a
contract
to
fresco
the
church
and
re
gild
the
cross
It
was
all
in
the
day
s
work
for
him
to
me
a
victory
but
when
I
descended
and
realised
what
a
shock
I
had
inflicted
on
the
loving
woman
my
conceit
was
dampened
for
the
nonce
Another
picture
Evening
in
the
nuns
flower
garden
at
Emmitsburg
Maryland
L
heure
exquise
as
the
poet
so
charmingly
phrases
it
In
the
soft
slanting
light
of
a
westering
sun
I
see
my
mother
slowly
walking
under
a
trellised
path
her
rosary
in
her
hand
on
her
head
a
mantilla
that
transformed
her
into
a
Spanish
dame
of
high
degree
I
was
not
more
than
eight
or
nine
years
old
but
it
was
the
first
time
that
I
consciously
realised
that
she
was
my
mother
She
was
the
most
beautiful
creature
on
earth
The
gentle
nuns
who
moved
along
this
enchanted
garden
were
only
phantoms
The
one
great
fact
was
my
mother
and
her
calm
intellectual
features
It
is
the
most
vivid
memory
I
have
of
her
With
difficulty
I
summon
up
to
my
recol
lection
meeting
there
the
poet
George
Miles
and
hear
ing
him
discourse
on
his
Pontius
Pilate
his
Truce
of
God
and
of
his
theory
as
to
the
cause
of
Hamlet
s
ir
resolution
This
theory
he
afterwards
published
and
the
essay
contains
some
plausible
arguments
among
the
rest
that
Hamlet
being
a
Roman
Catholic
and
a
fervent
believer
despite
his
surface
scepticism
could
not
kill
the
King
unshriven
without
doing
violence
to
his
conscience
As
Hamletic
theories
go
it
is
worth
while
I
must
add
that
while
we
had
Jewish
friends
I
did
not
fail
to
associate
with
boys
and
girls
of
our
own
race
and
religion
the
Barrys
the
Raleighs
the
SuIIivans
Dohans
Wilcoxes
McGIenseys
Doughertys
and
other
Americans
of
Irish
stock
Will
Sullivan
the
brother
of
John
and
James
was
one
of
the
handsomest
young
men
of
our
set
and
possessed
a
nature
transparent
and
lova
ble
Yet
when
it
came
to
spooning
I
sought
pasture
elsewhere
than
among
our
crowd
My
first
grand
passion
was
a
cousin
but
she
jilted
me
for
my
younger
brother
Then
a
certain
Annie
and
a
Theresa
loomed
large
Annie
was
short
plump
materialistic
Theresa
wore
long
curls
had
large
eyes
an
empty
gaze
and
a
saccharine
smile
in
short
she
was
a
girl
of
the
sort
that
girls
detest
Sly
was
the
epithet
applied
to
her
by
Annie
Neither
one
cared
a
rap
for
me
but
each
was
determined
to
beat
the
other
I
played
a
fatuous
Paris
to
their
rivalry
but
when
I
attempted
to
award
the
golden
apple
meaning
myself
they
at
once
became
close
friends
and
gave
me
the
cold
shoulder
For
weeks
I
ruminated
not
without
bitterness
on
feminine
treachery
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
consult
my
mother
She
bade
me
not
put
my
trust
in
princes
and
quoted
Wolsey
s
speech
If
I
had
served
my
God
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
superfluous
It
is
Lincoln
who
is
credited
with
the
wise
and
witty
axiom
You
can
fool
all
of
the
people
some
of
the
time
and
some
of
the
people
all
of
the
time
but
you
can
t
fool
all
the
people
all
the
time
He
might
have
added
But
you
can
fool
yourself
every
time
Self-illusion
is
the
staff
of
life
the
bread
of
egotism
I
am
not
precisely
a
determinist
yet
I
believe
our
characters
are
immutable
I
have
always
fooled
myself
and
successfully
up
to
a
given
point
then
the
disillusionment
is
accepted
as
a
necessity
It
had
to
come
I
would
say
seeking
con
solation
in
the
shabby
snare
of
fatalism
The
petticoat
mirage
found
me
easiest
of
victims
It
was
years
later
I
discovered
that
in
the
land
of
tone
may
be
found
the
Elysian
Fields
My
mother
s
delicate
warning
fell
on
deaf
ears
and
when
my
father
mocked
me
beware
of
the
girls
I
retorted
with
the
elder
Weller
s
advice
to
his
son
beware
of
the
vidders
Samivel
I
knew
it
all
before
I
was
out
of
my
teens
The
omniscience
of
youth
is
both
the
pride
and
despair
of
parents
My
craze
for
the
girls
was
no
doubt
an
illustration
of
Henry
James
s
manners
observable
in
the
most
mimetic
depart
ment
of
any
great
menagerie
But
boys
weren
t
mon
keys
nor
girls
parrots
then
as
they
seem
when
life
sets
such
things
in
truer
perspective
I
have
never
suffered
from
the
Time
illusion
The
past
or
future
did
not
exist
It
seldom
does
for
the
young
I
have
always
had
the
delusion
of
free-will
There
is
only
the
present
That
long
shining
corridor
of
Time
did
not
invite
me
to
traverse
its
eternal
leagues
Carpe
diem
When
I
read
in
Henri
Bergson
s
phil
osophy
thrice-subtle
French
Jew
that
Time
is
both
tough
and
resistant
I
rejected
the
idea
fair
as
it
is
to
the
abused
concept
Time
always
playing
a
minor
role
when
in
company
with
its
brother
Space
Not
even
meta
physical
Time
is
resistant
I
can
t
divest
my
conscious
ness
of
the
notion
naturally
an
empirical
one
that
Time
is
the
glittering
crest
of
a
moment
not
one
of
a
series
of
beads
strung
out
through
eternity
Eternity
is
Now
Live
in
the
present
which
passes
like
a
flash
of
lightning
I
suspect
that
Walter
Pater
and
his
famous
conclusion
to
the
Studies
in
the
Renaissance
had
much
to
do
with
my
crystallisation
of
this
worship
of
the
present
My
present
didn
t
mean
the
actual
far
from
it
A
cuckoo
cloudland
was
for
me
the
present
I
had
neither
hind
sight
nor
foresight
With
David
Thoreau
I
could
have
cried
Thank
God
they
can
t
cut
down
the
clouds
possibly
substituting
girls
for
clouds
And
petti
coats
stray
in
where
fools
fear
to
enter
Girls
are
ever
wise
so
they
appeared
to
me
At
each
hour
of
the
day
I
said
with
Faust
Stay
thou
art
so
fair
And
they
stayed
that
s
the
funny
part
of
it
They
jeered
at
me
but
they
remained
companions
I
recall
a
dark-skinned
black-haired
girl
who
was
nicknamed
Portuguese
Annie
She
was
a
nicely
behaved
miss
of
seventeen
and
one
of
those
apathetic
flirts
She
never
regarded
you
except
from
a
great
height
unless
another
girl
became
too
friendly
then
hawk-like
she
would
swoop
down
on
her
i8o
STEEPLEJACK
innocent
prey
meaning
my
Iamb-like
self
and
carry
him
away
to
her
fastness
there
to
be
dropped
into
the
next
nest
of
her
indifference
She
piqued
did
Portuguese
Annie
why
Portuguese
I
never
found
out
perhaps
be
cause
she
was
Irish
I
met
her
of
rainy
nights
in
Fair
mount
Park
We
went
around
the
Reservoir
At
times
we
sat
on
wet
benches
an
umbrella
lifted
her
cloak
about
us
When
the
guardian
of
public
morals
shooed
us
away
we
sought
another
bench
and
potential
pneu
monia
What
was
our
conversation
I
ve
forgotten
Probably
chaste
and
silly
One
night
as
we
walked
about
Logan
Square
a
lame
man
hobbled
in
front
of
us
then
he
limped
to
our
rear
A
spy
A
relative
I
warned
Annie
She
didn
t
recognise
him
and
he
so
manoeuvred
that
I
couldn
t
At
the
advanced
hour
of
nine
we
separated
and
forever
The
reason
I
never
saw
her
again
was
a
simple
one
That
lame
man
was
my
elder
brother
playing
detective
At
home
he
warned
me
that
I
was
a
sentimental
ass
I
openly
admitted
it
There
was
other
balm
in
Gilead
The
charms
of
Portu
guese
Annie
had
begun
to
pall
The
Eternal
Feminine
led
me
upward
and
on
Not
far
from
Logan
Square
there
was
a
mysterious
mansion
occupied
by
two
men
possibly
brothers
though
they
did
not
betray
any
family
resemblance
and
one
of
the
most
beautiful
girls
on
our
perambulating
bone-yard
of
a
planet
The
entire
neighbourhood
of
boys
said
she
was
peerless
and
I
soon
chimed
in
Through
the
inter
mediary
of
her
brother
he
turned
up
from
somewhere
we
were
introduced
and
I
called
at
discreet
intervals
every
afternoon
between
five
and
six
They
were
for
eigners
Swiss
I
think
and
their
drawing-room
was
decorum
personified
I
can
t
tell
how
it
was
managed
but
each
boy
had
his
solo
or
rather
duo
interview
with
the
lovely
Clarisse
I
called
her
Monna
Lisa
because
of
her
delicate
hands
and
slow
cold
gaze
She
could
out
stare
a
wooden
Indian
or
a
brass
monkey
and
when
she
condescended
to
drop
her
disdainful
eyelids
we
shivered
in
ecstasy
We
adored
her
and
quarrelled
over
her
like
a
pack
of
hungry
hounds
about
a
live
goose
Our
leisure
was
spent
in
discussing
her
mysterious
family
No
one
knew
them
knew
their
business
except
that
at
five
o
clock
their
solemn
hospitality
was
bestowed
upon
the
elect
We
the
ganders
were
the
elect
Hot
love
was
made
to
this
madonna
We
tried
to
arrange
meetings
outside
In
vain
I
never
saw
such
admirable
team
work
We
were
brethren
united
in
a
noble
cause
to
carry
off
Clarisse
from
her
home
and
marry
her
not
all
of
us
only
myself
and
every
chap
said
the
same
Boys
have
monstrous
fancies
We
believed
that
girl
perse
cuted
by
her
loving
father
and
uncle
though
she
was
serenely
happy
We
made
up
to
her
gawky
brother
bribing
him
with
cigarettes
fondly
hoping
for
a
gleam
of
light
on
the
dark
enigma
of
the
household
He
never
vouchsafed
us
this
illuminating
ray
of
hope
The
plot
thickened
Other
boys
came
into
the
net
Every
now
and
then
we
were
not
admitted
though
we
saw
our
nut-brown
maid
in
the
bay-window
on
the
second
floor
presumably
leading
on
another
brave
knight
to
destruction
We
descended
so
low
in
the
moral
scale
as
to
spy
upon
the
house
after
dark
By
climbing
the
wall
of
the
Quaker
graveyard
opposite
we
could
at
the
risk
of
our
unworthy
necks
peer
into
the
lighted
rooms
We
never
saw
a
thing
the
curtains
were
always
drawn
Time
passed
Clarisse
remained
the
Marble
Heart
of
our
despairing
fancy
Suddenly
her
family
moved
A
sign
to
let
froze
our
overheated
blood
Where
did
they
go
this
charming
mysterious
family
Alas
no
one
ever
discovered
But
we
discovered
ourselves
when
one
evening
in
conclave
over
pipes
and
gingerpop
we
frankly
bared
our
hearts
Every
man
Jack
present
had
proposed
marriage
to
Clarisse
not
one
was
more
than
eighteen
and
had
been
accepted
At
least
ten
of
us
admitted
the
soft
impeachment
We
reviled
ourselves
at
the
outlay
in
engagement
rings
Each
chap
outdid
the
other
in
his
effort
to
make
himself
the
king-pin
of
ridicule
I
fear
there
were
unshed
drops
in
our
tear-ducts
we
were
so
desperately
gay
When
I
say
that
we
all
popped
the
question
I
must
omit
George
Wickersham
who
had
re
mained
a
critical
onlooker
If
I
ever
marry
he
as
sured
us
I
wish
at
least
to
know
the
lady
s
last
name
George
didn
t
approve
of
matrimony
in
the
dark
I
fancy
the
solution
of
the
mystery
was
only
a
widower
endeavouring
to
marry
his
daughter
to
the
best
advan
tage
That
chapter
closed
I
began
another
one
but
stay
These
memoirs
are
not
intended
to
describe
my
senti
mental
education
Any
man
could
write
a
book
of
many
pages
and
call
it
My
Love-Life
or
Vita
Sexualis
as
the
psychiatric
jargon
goes
It
would
sell
like
hot
cakes
on
a
wintry
night
Consider
George
Moore
s
Memoirs
of
My
Dead
Life
the
unexpurgated
English
edition
When
I
anxiously
consulted
my
editor
as
to
the
inclusion
of
the
love
element
without
which
existence
is
like
an
addled
egg
he
tersely
replied
Be
interesting
and
if
you
can
t
be
interesting
be
careful
But
then
one
can
t
be
careful
and
interesting
at
the
same
time
Many
a
woman
has
come
to
shipwreck
in
attempting
that
im
possible
task
You
can
t
have
your
cake
and
swallow
it
So
I
shall
desist
from
further
recital
of
my
salad
loves
except
to
add
that
on
the
boards
I
had
three
pas
sions
Adelaide
Neilson
Mary
Scott-Siddons
and
Tere
sita
Carreno
and
as
these
three
women
ranked
as
the
most
beautiful
of
their
day
I
had
half
the
town
assisting
me
in
my
worship
Carreno
in
particular
with
her
exotic
colouring
brilliant
eyes
and
still
more
brilliant
piano-playing
was
like
a
visitor
from
another
star
One
night
at
a
Gaertner
concert
she
wore
a
scarlet
dress
and
a
rose
coquettishly
placed
in
her
raven-black
hair
drove
the
blood
from
my
heart
probably
pumped
it
too
fast
I
shall
always
remember
this
thrice-charming
and
thrice-married
woman
and
great
artiste
in
the
scarlet
mists
of
my
memory
When
I
told
her
later
of
my
folly
she
nai
vely
answered
But
you
foolish
boy
why
didn
t
you
send
me
a
bouquet
of
red
roses
then
I
should
have
known
that
you
admired
me
The
worst
trick
that
fate
plays
on
us
is
to
let
us
know
too
late
how
near
we
grazed
happiness
MUSIC-MADNESS
Every
girl
has
her
day
I
couldn
t
forever
feed
on
sweetmeats
My
musical
studies
were
satisfactorily
progressing
I
knew
because
I
never
opened
a
law
book
and
also
because
of
my
debut
as
a
pianist
in
company
with
my
chum
Franz
Schubert
Together
we
played
Grieg
s
first
Sonata
for
violin
and
piano
in
F
opus
8
and
a
Sonata
by
Ries
Franz
played
the
slow
movement
from
the
Mendelssohn
Concerto
and
Wieniawski
s
Legende
and
most
musically
He
was
a
skilled
fresco-painter
but
I
think
he
should
have
stuck
to
music
I
followed
with
the
Loreley
by
Seeling
and
some
Schubert
pieces
As
we
were
not
paid
for
our
services
it
being
a
benefit
concert
on
Franklin
Street
in
a
small
hall
somewhere
near
Poplar
or
Parrish
Streets
we
were
warmly
ap
plauded
There
were
no
press-notices
luckily
enough
It
was
my
first
and
with
a
solitary
appearance
in
Paris
my
last
appearance
in
public
as
a
pianist
The
world
of
music
has
lost
nothing
through
my
resolve
not
to
wear
my
musical
motley
on
the
concert
platform
But
I
have
worn
it
in
print
too
often
We
must
all
of
us
eat
our
peck
of
dirt
However
Schubert
and
I
continued
to
play
music
in
private
At
the
Academy
our
seats
were
in
the
top
gallery
better
known
as
the
amphitheatre
entrance
25
cents
When
last
season
I
saw
the
line
stretched
along
Locust
Street
patiently
waiting
for
the
doors
to
open
and
then
a
wild
rushing
up-stairs
to
be
rewarded
by
the
tones
of
Jascha
Heifetz
s
magic
fiddle
it
was
easy
for
me
to
forget
the
forty
odd
years
when
we
also
stood
there
good
or
bad
weather
hoping
to
get
a
front-row
seat
or
when
Theodore
Thomas
conducted
his
wonderful
orchestra
With
Alfredo
Barili
I
heard
Joseffy
play
and
Theodore
Ritter
with
all
three
I
studied
later
My
first
visit
to
the
Academy
began
when
the
Majiltons
or
was
it
the
Hanlon-Lees
acrobats
extraordinary
Little
America
a
Japanese
child
astonished
with
his
aerial
flights
Ole
Bull
Vieuxtemps
Sivori
played
their
fiddles
but
it
was
Thomas
that
I
best
loved
The
orchestra
the
synthesis
of
instruments
cured
me
of
my
operatic
mania
The
symphony
with
its
reasoned
narrative
in
tone
is
the
epitome
of
music
The
Mercantile
Library
on
Tenth
Street
where
it
is
to-day
had
me
as
a
daily
visitor
It
was
there
I
began
my
browsing
in
many
fields
Like
an
animal
I
instinc
tively
sought
the
food
my
system
demanded
I
was
like
a
horse
let
out
to
graze
I
must
have
had
an
appalling
appetite
for
printed
matter
I
would
in
the
absence
of
an
English
book
read
any
foreign
language
although
I
didn
t
understand
it
There
was
something
friendly
and
inviting
in
strange
letters
Hebrew
intrigued
my
fancy
To-day
I
can
make
out
the
meaning
of
headlines
in
a
Yiddish
newspaper
thanks
to
that
one-eyed
ex
rabbi
s
lessons
I
had
the
good
luck
to
read
the
new
English
literature
of
the
seventies
and
eighties
The
poets
enthralled
me
Swinburne
Dante
Gabriel
Ros
setti
William
Morris
Matthew
Arnold
Clough
Patmore
and
the
Alfred
Tennyson
of
that
period
as
well
as
George
Meredith
as
poet
and
a
host
of
minor
singers
such
as
Gosse
his
On
Viol
and
Flute
Arthur
O
Shaugnessy
Austin
Dobson
delightful
reading
and
even
the
ex
travagant
Theophile
Marzials
The
essayists
Arnold
Pater
George
Saintsbury
who
first
wrote
of
Baude
laire
attracted
me
But
the
pre-Raphaelitic
movement
left
me
indifferent
especially
the
painters
I
had
suffi
cient
art
training
to
recognise
the
gimcrack
mysticism
preciosity
and
woful
lack
of
expert
brushwork
in
the
productions
of
the
Brotherhood
Think
of
Woolner
as
a
sculptor
A
mediocre
modeller
who
wrote
occasional
verse
Rossetti
is
a
musical
poet
as
a
picture-maker
he
is
an
imitator
the
hand
is
his
but
the
voice
is
the
voice
of
the
Italian
Primitives
A
pretty
colour
scheme
a
sentimental
attitude
towards
mediaeval
religious
faith
and
drawing
that
is
papery
His
sonnets
will
be
read
when
his
painting
is
forgotten
A
visit
to
the
Grosvenor
Gallery
is
a
disillusion
Watts
is
another
mediocrity
despite
his
poetry
His
paint
is
woolly
his
design
obviously
eclectic
that
is
not
original
Edward
Burne-Jones
has
a
thin
vein
of
poetry
but
his
wan
alle
gories
seen
in
the
cruel
light
of
this
century
are
feeble
dreams
I
like
better
the
honest
but
uninspired
realism
of
Ford
Madox-Brown
Albert
Moore
is
decorative
Leighton
pasticcio
and
Holman
Hunt
with
his
Light
of
the
World
is
a
sacred
bore
The
one
strong
man
John
Millais
didn
t
long
remain
in
the
movement
His
artistic
lungs
were
too
big
to
respire
in
that
morbid
marsh
air
of
mysticism
and
faded
eroticism
I
had
begun
to
enjoy
the
Barbizons
but
the
French
Impressionists
I
knew
little
about
yet
there
they
were
only
a
few
miles
across
the
Channel
bringing
the
pure
light
of
heaven
into
the
dingy
musty
atmosphere
of
Academic
art
while
the
pre-Raphaelites
their
faces
turned
towards
the
fifteenth
century
were
indulging
in
various
insincere
poses
and
hysterical
contortions
thus
thinking
to
set
back
the
implacable
clock
of
time
London
was
then
artistically
as
far
from
Paris
as
if
it
were
Pekin
To
catch
the
first
glow
of
a
rising
sun
is
a
pleasant
experience
Swinburne
was
new
Wagner
was
new
Manet
Monet
and
Rodin
were
new
I
was
happy
in
being
born
at
such
cross-roads
of
art
I
watched
all
novel
manifestations
across
the
water
George
Eliot
had
just
published
Daniel
Deronda
and
while
the
waning
of
her
popularity
dated
from
that
fiction
over
here
she
was
at
her
apogee
I
admired
her
still
admire
her
but
wouldn
t
give
up
Charlotte
Bronte
or
Jane
Austen
for
her
Indeed
I
would
rather
read
the
critical
writings
of
her
companion
George
Henry
Lewes
with
his
lively
Jewish
imagination
capital
memory
and
splendid
work
manship
His
Life
of
Goethe
despite
some
omissions
is
better
than
the
pretentious
three-volume
biography
of
Bielochowsky
and
where
is
there
a
more
succinct
summing
up
of
the
historical
aspects
of
philosophy
than
Lewes
furnished
us
His
coda
a
veritable
challenge
to
idealism
and
its
exponents
still
remains
unanswerable
On
the
last

of
The
Biographical
History
of
Philosophy
he
asks
Have
we
any
ideas
independent
of
experience
The
answer
is
always
a
negative
The
latest
champion
of
idealistic
absolutism
despite
William
James
and
his
Pluralism
it
is
idealism
Henri
Bergson
may
wriggle
as
metaphysically
as
he
pleases
and
as
a
phrase-maker
he
is
an
artist
but
he
can
t
evade
that
question
of
George
Henry
Lewes
without
imperilling
his
shaky
lath
plaster
and
cobweb
edifice
The
essay
by
Lewes
on
Actors
and
Acting
is
a
classic
Never
theless
George
Eliot
had
a
touch
of
genius
and
her
mate
had
not
He
was
supremely
clever
nothing
more
The
Mercantile
Library
was
a
trysting
spot
for
enam
oured
youth
There
I
saw
the
girl
with
the
medallion
features
and
Titian
hair
there
we
had
encounters
with
the
old
Cerberus
Donigan
who
only
did
his
duty
as
a
doorkeeper
in
keeping
the
lobbies
clear
and
suppressing
laughter
We
thought
otherwise
We
loved
to
romp
raise
a
row
and
drop
books
I
can
evoke
the
absorbed
expression
of
Mr
Edmands
the
librarian
which
would
modulate
into
pained
astonishment
when
our
gang
talked
too
loudly
in
the
reading-room
After
we
were
ejected
which
occurred
at
least
once
a
month
we
would
shake
our
fists
at
Donigan
and
go
across
the
street
to
Dooner
s
there
to
swagger
before
the
bar
and
sip
soda-cocktails
as
harmless
as
buttermilk
What
men
around
town
we
were
Popular
concerts
conducted
by
Sentz
or
Mark
Hassler
or
Wolsieffer
always
saw
us
I
made
the
ac
quaintance
through
a
school
companion
young
Shaw
of
his
brother-in-law
Siegfried
Behrens
an
admirable
conductor
of
opera
as
well
as
a
scholarly
musician
I
think
the
Shaws
lived
on
Locust
Street
A
Sunday
morning
treat
was
to
go
in
company
with
my
father
to
High
Mass
at
St
Augustine
s
Church
to
the
choir
there
to
hear
Henry
Thunder
Sr
play
the
organ
of
which
he
was
a
master
His
pedalling
made
me
forget
the
divine
service
There
was
a
bass
in
the
choir
named
Winter
bottom
a
friend
of
my
father
s
who
always
saluted
him
as
Summertop
The
association
of
Thunder
and
Winter
bottom
set
me
to
speculation
With
Laurence
Sterne
s
Slawkenbergius
I
believed
in
the
fitness
of
names
I
have
mentioned
Alfredo
Barili
He
taught
me
He
was
a
finished
pianist
of
the
French
school
When
he
first
played
Chopin
s
B
minor
Scherzo
for
me
it
acted
like
catnip
on
a
feline
I
rolled
over
the
floor
The
music
made
my
nerves
naked
I
play
the
tragic
morbid
com
position
now
yet
can
never
rid
myself
of
the
initial
impression
Later
S
L
Hermann
and
Anthony
Stanko
witch
guided
my
musical
studies
What
these
three
young
men
thought
of
me
I
never
knew
but
I
do
know
that
they
were
exceedingly
forbearing
The
sad
sequel
is
that
with
all
my
striving
I
only
attained
mediocrity
as
a
pianist
Any
young
conservatory
miss
can
out
play
me
in
glib
fingering
Yet
music
is
a
consolation
an
anodyne
like
religion
It
keeps
off
the
deadliest
beast
that
lurks
in
the
jungle
of
life
the
beast
I
stand
most
in
fear
of
ennui
Many
are
driven
to
monotonous
labor
by
ennui
Its
presence
is
a
pathological
symptom
If
this
be
true
then
all
animal
creation
from
man
to
beetles
is
sick
in
spirit
I
ve
seen
dogs
yawn
from
bore
dom
yea
even
the
flowers
droop
when
weary
of
life
Art
has
been
my
escape
and
my
native
laziness
was
surmounted
by
the
terror
bred
of
ennui
Making
money
love
playing
games
are
but
so
many
forms
by
which
to
escape
the
oppressive
monster
and
also
to
create
the
illusion
of
progress
To
fill
in
the
seemingly
intermina
ble
interval
from
womb
to
tomb
man
invented
politics
money
wine
cards
war
love
and
religion
Satan
Mekatrig
is
personally
interested
in
several
of
these
in
ventions
A
certain
Christmas
I
ve
forgotten
the
year
I
was
con
sidered
by
such
inexpert
authority
as
my
parents
to
be
capable
of
handling
a
church
organ
My
nervousness
was
pooh-poohed
as
stage
fright
Finally
I
ceded
but
only
after
severe
pressure
Midnight
Mass
at
Christmas
Eve
had
been
temporarily
abolished
by
Archbishop
Wood
a
Mass
with
music
at
6
A
M
taking
its
place
Without
a
day
s
warning
I
was
asked
to
substitute
for
the
organist
at
the
church
near
Moyamensing
Prison
I
went
to
bed
early
spent
a
sleepless
night
anticipating
a
breakdown
at
the
organ
and
of
being
chased
from
the
choir
Shivering
I
arose
at
four
o
clock
swallowed
a
pot
of
coffee
to
keep
up
my
courage
and
to
prevent
the
heart
leaping
out
of
my
bosom
and
proceeded
to
board
a
Tenth
Street
horse-car
It
took
about
an
hour
to
reach
the
church
I
can
t
recollect
its
name
though
I
shall
never
forget
its
interior
and
when
I
arrived
in
the
choir
it
must
have
been
a
half-hour
too
soon
The
place
was
chilly
I
gloomed
around
tried
the
little
organ
and
its
two
banks
of
keys
and
was
wondering
what
Mass
I
was
expected
to
play
without
rehearsal
when
the
soprano
appeared
It
was
Madame
Sauvan
a
friend
of
my
mother
s
who
proved
my
saviour
She
picked
out
either
Concone
s
or
Bordone
s
Mass
very
easy
to
read
and
she
gave
me
a
welcome
hint
about
the
voice
of
the
celebrant
priest
who
sometimes
deviated
from
pitch
The
worshippers
straggled
in
the
choir
arrived
the
Mass
began
and
my
knees
as
well
as
my
teeth
started
to
chatter
Didn
t
you
ever
have
chattering
knees
I
plunged
into
the
music
ahead
or
behind
the
singers
My
tempi
were
erratic
Madame
Sauvan
beat
time
for
me
and
steadied
my
nerves
There
was
no
pause
for
a
sermon
and
the
solemn
service
smoothly
progressed
I
had
to
accompany
the
reverend
Father
In
the
Pater
Noster
he
intoned
the
Et
ne
nos
inducas
in
tentationem
a
half
tone
flat
I
vainly
scrambled
from
the
key
of
G
to
F
sharp
There
followed
a
dis
tinct
series
of
dissonances
that
would
have
made
Richard
Strauss
or
Stravinsky
envious
I
peeped
into
the
tell
tale
mirror
hung
over
the
organ
manuals
which
enables
the
organist
to
watch
the
movements
before
the
altar
I
saw
one
movement
and
I
grew
pale
It
was
the
indignant
side
glance
shot
at
me
by
the
priest
He
blamed
me
for
his
singing
off-key
If
he
had
shot
me
I
should
have
died
with
a
martyr
s
aureole
and
a
heavenly
smile
on
my
lips
Cold
as
was
the
morning
I
sweated
I
fled
after
playing
the
Adeste
Fidelis
so
disconsolate
was
I
over
my
blundering
It
is
the
prime
duty
of
an
organist
never
to
allow
the
congregation
to
overhear
flat
singing
on
the
part
of
the
clergy
To
do
that
is
to
commit
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
of
music
Madame
Sauvan
told
my
mother
some
weeks
later
that
I
did
as
well
as
could
be
expected
which
truly
feminine
expression
left
me
more
dubious
than
ever
as
to
my
success
When
I
wrote
a
horrible
and
blasphemous
short
story
though
I
still
can
t
see
the
blasphemy
entitled
Where
the
Black
Mass
was
Heard
and
translated
into
French
by
Remy
de
Gourmont
I
utilised
as
a
background
the
choir
of
this
church
also
the
crypt
of
St
Joseph
s
Church
in
Willing
s
Alley
This
tale
was
not
admired
by
those
clergy
of
the
diocese
who
read
it
yet
in
it
I
only
affirmed
in
un
mistakable
terms
what
is
preached
from
every
Roman
Catholic
pulpit
i
e
the
existence
of
a
personal
devil
the
demon
of
mid-day
who
goes
abroad
like
a
lion
seek
ing
whom
he
may
devour
I
had
been
reading
too
much
Huysmans
and
his
description
of
the
Black
Mass
in
that
astounding
novel
La-bas
but
my
yarn
which
is
not
in
cluded
in
my
Melomaniacs
or
Visionaries
is
individual
and
devoid
of
the
erotic
element
Remy
de
Gourmont
wrote
me
a
letter
of
congratulation
when
the
story
ap
peared
in
M*lle
New
York
declaring
that
my
invention
was
as
vivid
as
Huysmans
The
mistake
I
made
was
merely
a
matter
of
taste
I
should
not
have
used
St
Joseph
s
as
the
spot
where
my
particular
devil
showed
himself
horns
hoofs
and
hide
although
he
hangs
around
churches
as
is
well
known
in
theological
circles
I
have
dwelt
on
religious
matters
too
much
but
only
to
prove
that
my
vocation
despite
my
pious
environ
ment
was
not
a
priestly
one
I
often
follow
with
my
eyes
some
young
priest
and
shudder
at
the
idea
that
I
might
have
been
persuaded
into
taking
orders
and
with
what
doleful
consequences
There
but
for
the
grace
of
God

I
John
Wesley
s
words
I
say
To
me
the
most
melancholy
apparitions
in
this
vale
of
Armageddon
are
a
disfrocked
priest
an
ex-vice-president
an
ex
dramatic
critic
There
is
no
such
thing
as
an
ex-music
critic
a
music-critic
never
stops
criticising
Even
on
his
death-bed
he
would
criticise
the
tone-production
of
GabriePs
last
trump
Religion
has
given
an
emotional
colouring
to
my
modes
of
thought
It
has
been
called
a
crutch
for
lame
minds
by
Huxley
it
is
really
a
spiritual
anodyne
Mankind
demands
some
superstition
to
give
it

Voltaire

wrote
for

belief

Without

Montaigne
Anatole
France
made
of
their
scepticism
the
smiling
religion
which
their
souls
craved
We
all
worship
something
usually
ourselves
There
is
a
wilderness
in
the
heart
of
every
human
And
the
arch-devil
ennui
hides
behind
the
trees
spying
his
chance
Mother
Church
knew
this
when
she
devised
her
elaborate
ritual
her
consoling
sacraments
her
future
rewards
and
punishments
The
void
is
filled
Man
ever
credulous
spends
his
life
earning
a
living
and
dodging
the
devil
Eternal
activity
is
the
price
of
sleep
I
am
chronicling
all
the
small-beer
of
my
uneventful
life
because
I
am
afraid
of
the
twilight
that
sets
in
during
the
lonesome
latter
years
The
personal
pronoun
which
I
am
forced
to
use
and
abuse
but
serves
as
a
peg
upon
which
is
hung
the
loop
of
my
narrative
I
am
not
a
grandfather
but
I
have
reached
the
age
of
dissent
In
youth
we
rebel
in
old
age
we
dissent

wrote
Youth

JIM
THE
PENMAN
Annie
Hampton
Brewster
wrote
the
book
that
set
me
off
on
another
tangent
and
helped
to
decide
my
future
occupations
It
is
called
St
Martin
s
Summer
and
was
published
by
Ticknor
Fields
Boston
1866
It
is
out
of
print
as
is
her
musical
novel
Compensation
the
latter
superior
to
the
Charles
Auchester
kind
of
musical
stories
Miss
Brewster
was
for
years
Paris
Correspondent
of
the
Philadelphia
Evening
Bulletin
and
was
succeeded
by
Lucy
Hamilton
Hooper
She
went
to
Rome
and
wrote
letters
to
the
same
newspaper
that
revealed
her
generous
culture
and
critical
sensibility
Writers
of
her
calibre
were
as
rare
then
as
they
are
now
As
Havelock
Ellis
says
The
exquisite
things
of
life
are
to-day
as
rare
and
precious
as
they
ever
were
St
Martin
s
Summer
is
a
book
composed
of
loosely-strung
chapters
a
mere
thread
of
a
story
connecting
them
There
are
travel
pictures
criticisms
of
art
literature
and
music
keen
apergus
and
a
catholicity
in
taste
that
is
refreshing
in
this
age
of
specialisation
and
Gradgrind
efficiency
The
times
were
more
spacious
the
dilettante
was
still
in
exist
ence
dead
as
the
dodo
bird
now
and
life
a
pleasanter
affair
To
be
sure
there
were
wars
and
rumours
of
war
and
politics
and
Cad
Stanton
Dr
Mary
Walker
and
the
mysterious
case
of
Charlie
Ross
There
were
also
cultivated
men
and
women
who
saw
life
steadily
and
as
a
whole
Miss
Brewster
was
one
of
them
A
convert
to
the
Roman
Catholic
faith
her
tact
saved
her
from
excess
in
zeal
I
admit
she
was
occasionally
sentimental
and
that
her
judgments
were
not
always
sound
but
she
introduced
me
to
Stendhal
and
to
a
group
of
writers
not
so
cynical
as
Stendhal
to
whom
I
owe
much
grati
tude
Chateaubriand
among
others
The
Centennial
Exposition
and
the
Brewster
book
set
ringing
the
alarm
bells
in
my
conscience
Europe
was
bound
to
see
me
soon
A
victim
to
suggestion
the
Higher
Snobbery
I
fancy
it
should
be
called
I
discovered
Walt
Whitman
after
reading
the
admirable
essay
by
Moncure
D
Conway
the
uncle
of
General
Peyton
March
on
the
distaff
side
in
The
Atlantic
and
as
I
followed
that
grand
old
iconoclast
in
many
of
his
views
I
became
a
Whitmaniac
about
in
the
same
time
that
Swinburne
William
Rossetti
the
brother
of
the
painter-poet
and
John
Addington
Symonds
sang
the
praises
of
the
Camden
bard
also
at
the
same
time
that
William
Winter
dramatic
critic
of
the
New
York
Tribune
and
poet
the
Weeping
Willie
of
Charlie
McCIellan
attacked
Leaves
of
Grass
Walt
disposed
of
Winter
thus
Now
there
s
Willie
Winter
miserable
little
cuss
Swinburne
had
penned
his
dithyrambic
praise
of
Whitman
in
his
study
of
William
Blake
and
compared
that
master
of
lyrics
to
the
American
yawper
A
poor
enough
comparison
for
in
Blake
there
is
lovely
music
while
in
Whitman
the
chaff
almost
smothers
the
wheat
Possibly
the
Prophetic
Books
of
Blake
and
their
windy
ramifications
suggested
the
comparison
certainly
Swinburne
was
un
happy
in
that
as
later
he
permitted
himself
to
scold
Whitman
like
a
fishwife
that
is
the
fishwife
of
Daniel
O
Connell
He
said
Whitman
wrote
poetry
as
would
a
drunken
apple-woman
I
quote
from
memory
Again
old
Walt
called
the
turn
As
reported
by
Hor
ace
Traubel
he
remarked
of
this
sudden
change
in
the
critical
attitude
of
the
poet
Swinburne
ain
t
he
the
damnedest
simulacrum
Simulacrum
in
this
case
is
almost
too
good
to
be
true
That
exquisite
poet
and
prose
stylist
Alice
Meynell
reached
the
same
conclu
sion
in
her
Hearts
of
Controversy
about
Swinburne
she
doesn
t
even
believe
in
his
foaming
passion
After
reading
that
Shelley
lived
on
fried
bread
I
upset
our
kitchen
by
frying
bread
and
writing
verse
under
its
greasy
inspiration
That
and
my
short-lived
Whitman
worship
are
indices
of
my
weather-cock
tem
perament
And
with
Walt
there
was
a
more
personal
reason
I
was
in
love
with
a
dainty
miss
who
weighed
two
hundred
pounds
She
literally
oozed
health
and
was
sentimental
withal
most
fat
girls
are
Together
we
read
Children
of
Adam
and
when
I
showed
her
photo
the
good
old
soul
sympathetically
said
She
will
be
a
mother
of
ten
at
least
appraising
her
as
he
would
a
brood-mare
He
saw
men
and
women
as
fathers
and
mothers
and
his
preoccupation
with
sex
above
all
with
maternity
caused
Edmund
Clarence
Stedman
to
write
in
The
Century
that
there
are
other
lights
in
which
to
view
the
beloved
than
as
the
mother
of
one
s
future
children
However
Walt
was
right
He
represented
the
violent
recoil
from
the
New
England
school
in
whose
veins
flowed
ink
and
ice-water
His
bombastic
patri
otism
his
delight
in
cataloguing
the
various
parts
of
the
human
body
was
but
a
revolt
against
the
nasty-nice
puritanism
of
his
day
It
s
a
dull
reading
for
us
now
accustomed
as
we
are
to
the
poetry
and
fiction
of
ladies
with
triple-barrelled
names
In
the
seventies
when
Moncure
D
Conway
pleaded
for
a
fair
hearing
Walt
Wliitman
s
name
was
anathema
In
company
with
that
same
fat
girl
I
took
him
to
all
the
concerts
I
could
He
usually
scribbled
but
enjoyed
the
music
as
he
enjoyed
life
seemingly
through
his
pores
He
was
as
receptive
as
a
sponge
And
he
was
one
Then
the
pen
fever
seized
me
After
that
Sunday
afternoon
hailstorm
of
which
I
wrote
I
went
into
the
street
and
ate
my
fill
as
if
it
were
ice-cream
Pneu
monia
coupled
with
typhoid
fever
followed
and
it
meant
one
year
indoors
for
me
it
spoiled
me
completely
for
I
had
only
to
emit
a
hollow
cough
and
my
school
was
over
for
the
day
Boys
are
worse
humbugs
than
girls
and
that
is
saying
a
lot
I
slipped
around
the
curve
of
least
resistance
and
each
experiment
was
only
the
search
after
a
softer
spot
to
nestle
in
I
was
like
a
cat
I
wanted
my
place
in
the
sun
and
with
a
Dickens
novel
and
an
apple
or
ten
apples
I
was
perfectly
content
to
let
the
world
wag
on
The
vagabond
spirit
of
Whitman
fol
lowed
the
trail
of
the
gypsy
Much
later
when
Walden
and
A
Walk
to
Wauchusetts
fell
into
my
hands
I
realised
that
in
David
Thoreau
a
true
American
is
incarnated
and
not
in
Whitman
And
the
prose
of
Thoreau
What
an
artist
After
the
word-wallowing
of
Walt
who
wrote
neither
prose
nor
poetry
the
incisive
sentences
the
swift
moving
paragraphs
the
nutty
Yankee
flavour
are
singu
larly
convincing
A
mystic
he
writes
not
in
the
clear
obscure
style
of
Emerson
but
with
the
precision
the
con
cision
and
the
light
dark
from
excess
of
brilliance
I
hear
music
below
it
washes
the
dust
of
life
and
every
thing
I
look
at
The
pine-tree
is
as
immortal
as
I
am
and
perchance
go
to
as
high
a
heaven
there
to
tower
above
me
still
Walt
who
suffered
from
a
mental
indigestion
brought
on
by
MacPherson
s
Ossian
Emer
son
and
Thoreau
R
L
Stevenson
first
pointed
the
debt
he
owed
Thoreau
never
clarified
his
mental
proc
esses
enough
to
write
as
well
as
the
man
of
Walden
Pond
He
has
no
more
sex
though
he
loudly
advertises
his
virility
by
hanging
his
banner
on
the
outer
wall
than
Thoreau
whose
early
and
unhappy
love-affair
she
married
his
brother
made
him
a
stoic
He
is
more
tonic
than
Whitman
and
I
say
this
well
remembering
the
fact
that
in
my
obituary
of
Walt
I
slopped
over
most
uncritically
I
repeat
pen
and
ink
and
paper
beckoned
me
to
that
swamp
from
which
no
penman
ever
emerges
My
old
joke
so
old
that
it
is
decrepit
that
once
a
newspaper
man
always
a
cocotte
is
not
without
a
shade
of
truth
I
had
made
foolish
and
extravagant
attempts
at
fiction
The
Comet
The
Velvet
Tree
The
V-Shaped
Corsage
and
criticism
had
to
come
next
on
the
roster
of
my
destiny
I
needs
must
write
about
music
or
burst
I
began
with
the
Charles
H
Jarvis
Classical
Soirees
in
Natatorium
Hall
My
friendship
with
Leander
Williamson
who
with
his
brother
John
was
in
the
editorial
department
of
The
Evening
Bulletin
led
me
to
make
some
experiments
I
showed
them
to
him
All
right
said
Leander
bring
them
to
me
at
the
office
and
PII
see
that
they
go
into
type
Ferdinand
Fetherston
was
a
friend
of
my
par
ents
and
as
publisher
of
the
newspaper
in
company
with
Mr
Peacock
I
had
my
way
cleared
though
it
was
Leander
who
gave
me
my
first
lift
The
Jarvis
concerts
invariably
took
place
on
Saturday
nights
I
had
free
admission
because
of
the
Jarvis
friendship
I
usually
reached
the
hall
before
he
did
On
Sundays
I
laboriously
carved
out
an
article
Dr
Lambdin
and
Mr
Bunting
were
then
the
principal
music-critics
I
read
them
with
fanatical
fervour
but
I
also
read
Berlioz
Dr
Ritter
the
husband
of
Fanny
Raymond
Ritter
and
Franz
Hueffer
Critically
New
York
didn
t
exist
for
me
Boston
did
in
the
shape
of
Dwight
s
Journal
of
Music
I
possessed
the
critical
vocabulary
before
I
knew
my
scales
After
passing
under
the
revision
of
my
mother
the
story
was
ready
How
well
I
recall
my
halting
heart
as
I
climbed
the
two
or
three
stories
to
the
office
of
The
Bul
letin
Leander
would
ask
me
if
I
were
ill
or
only
fright
ened
It
s
those
stairs
I
would
reply
It
was
stage
fright
all
the
more
ridiculous
because
I
was
paid
nothing
for
my
work
It
was
worth
nothing
On
Tuesday
my
little
pair
of
paragraphs
duly
appeared
I
at
least
read
them
so
did
Mr
Jarvis
Michael
Cross
merely
smiled
his
funny
bone
being
tickled
by
the
idea
of
this
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse
writing
of
an
art
instead
of
first
mastering
it
But
the
method
hath
precedents
I
saved
these
notices
and
I
find
that
they
read
like
the
regulation
bone-dry
critique
with
its
spilth
of
adjectives
and
its
amateurish
omniscience
I
had
horse-sense
enough
to
avoid
too
many
technical
terms
and
the
criticisms
that
read
the
most
reasonable
are
those
in
which
the
news
element
predominates
But
the
critical
values
Oh
Moscheles
and
Kalkbrenner
were
treated
with
the
same
consideration
as
Beethoven
and
Schumann
Max
Hein
rich
often
sang
always
the
best
music
Emil
Gastel
was
a
frequent
guest
as
were
Mrs
Darling
Leopold
Engelke
Massah
Warner
and
Richard
Zeckwer
I
again
heard
the
call
I
determined
to
both
play
music
and
write
about
it
Qui
a
bu
boira
With
the
emerald
of
Antoninus
I
could
have
said
Whatever
happens
I
must
be
emerald
I
determined
to
be
a
musician
and
a
litterateur
Gosh
said
my
boy
friends
I
went
in
the
Summer
to
Bryn
Mawr
then
a
sketch
of
its
present
prosperity
I
remember
the
day
the
Wheeler
house
was
finished
and
with
old
Sam
Clemens
the
builder
I
put
the
little
tree
on
the
ridge-pole
of
the
roof
I
saw
Walter
Damrosch
conduct
a
chorus
in
the
wings
at
the
concert
of
his
father
Leopold
Damrosch
at
which
The
Damnation
of
Faust
by
Berlioz
was
sung
I
recall
trudging
after
every
parade
that
I
encountered
with
Beck
s
military
band
at
the
head
Beck
a
German
was
then
the
Sousa
of
Philadelphia
He
was
the
father
of
James
M
Beck
I
began
to
watch
the
pageant
of
life
I
asked
Leander
if
I
might
write
of
fires
dog
fights
or
drunken
men
He
said
yes
Unknown
to
my
father
and
absolutely
shirking
further
law
study
I
began
report
ing
for
The
Bulletin
Salary
nil
and
unattached
My
enthusiasm
might
have
led
to
a
profitable
connection
if
I
had
stuck
to
the
game
I
tried
my
prentice
hand
at
everything
I
reported
lectures
I
went
to
spiritual
istic
seances
and
one
Sunday
night
at
the
corner
of
Thirteenth
Street
and
Girard
Avenue
I
was
thrown
out
bodily
by
an
enraged
medium
whose
wrist
I
held
till
the
lights
were
turned
on
As
an
amateur
magician
that
kind
of
foolery
was
easy
to
expose
but
the
duped
ones
present
had
other
views
and
I
fled
down
two
flights
pursued
by
most
unspiritual
language
I
was
congratu
lated
by
Leander
Williamson
who
told
me
that
if
I
kept
it
up
a
century
or
so
I
might
become
an
editor
He
jeer
ingly
referred
to
me
as
the
boy-critic
I
taught
piano
I
went
into
the
house
of
bondage
where
to
the
click
of
the
metronome
the
puling
attempts
of
the
pupil
and
the
irritable
lead-pencil
of
the
teacher
was
added
the
fear
that
no
money
would
be
forthcoming
at
the
end
of
the
term
And
then
my
good
mother
who
thought
piano
teaching
was
a
gay
rigadoon
added
to
my
list
of
pupils
a
half-dozen
charity
patients
I
didn
t
much
mind
the
extra
burdens
But
I
did
protest
against
the
lack
of
talent
I
found
among
them
I
went
to
Riverton
N
J
two
days
a
week
That
was
an
agreeable
diversion
the
trip
the
pretty
country
roads
the
cordial
pupils
ah
what
a
nice
lot
of
little
girls
I
had
Their
names
sound
like
a
rosary
Hattie
Hovey
Ellie
Earp
Josie
Cook
Bertie
Bechtel
and
other
children
who
tapped
the
keys
while
their
mothers
complacently
listened
occa
sionally
rewarding
me
with
home-made
pie
and
milk
It
was
idyllic
I
ate
the
pie
and
gave
the
milk
to
the
cat
I
must
have
been
a
rotten
teacher
yet
my
pupils
progressed
I
had
more
important
ones
in
the
city
Miss
Lillie
Frismuth
of
Chestnut
Street
the
Misses
Lewis
of
Pine
Street
and
Miss
Dougherty
of
Spruce
Street
If
I
had
stayed
in
the
rut
to-day
I
might
have
owned
a
little
home
near
Manayunk
and
commuted
and
contributed
to
the
Musical
Banner
and
despite
the
dusti
ness
of
my
intellectuals
might
have
been
happy
with
a
galloping
gang
of
grandchildren
Qui
sait
About
this
time
I
met
Theodore
Presser
who
as
every
one
knows
has
started
musical
orphan
asylums
homes
for
reformed
musicians
and
sanatoriums
for
hands
lamed
by
excessive
use
of
the
thumbs
on
the
black
keys
Then
Mr
Presser
was
a
lean
hungry-looking
man
with
his
head
full
of
haif-crazy
schemes
at
least
they
seemed
so
to
me
He
had
started
a
musical
monthly
whose
pulse
temperature
and
respiration
he
watched
as
if
it
had
been
a
chick
in
an
incubator
And
it
was
a
chick
of
uncertain
health
I
wrote
paragraphs
for
it
betimes
I
spread
my
wings
and
flew
to
the
editorial
roost
and
sounded
my
little
cock-a-doodle-doo
My
salary
was
as
ever
nothing
but
Theodore
let
me
splash
about
in
his
pond
and
I
was
contented
Many
nights
we
went
to
the
post
office
there
anxiously
to
open
letters
What
a
hurrah
of
joy
when
a
dollar
bill
was
found
for
an
annual
sub
scription
Presser
who
is
the
Henry
Ford
of
Philadel
phia
sheet-music
saw
further
ahead
than
I
The
Etude
has
a
subscription
list
that
must
make
envious
even
Mr
Bok
Presser
did
it
all
with
his
canny
Yankee
patience
and
shrewdness
He
knew
that
the
daughter
of
the
plumber
the
daughter
of
the
policeman
hankered
after
music
and
he
deliberately
built
a
machine
to
cater
to
their
needs
The
curious
part
of
it
is
that
he
really
improved
their
taste
The
most
famous
pianists
con
tribute
to
The
Etude
are
read
and
inwardly
digested
I
am
in
hopes
that
if
these
few
lines
may
meet
his
eye
as
they
say
in
manuals
of
writing
made
easy
for
servant-girls
that
he
will
give
me
a
bed
for
my
old
bones
in
one
of
his
eleemosynary
institutions
You
never
can
tell
A
music-teacher
a
music-critic
an
au
thor
the
very
gods
fight
against
them
in
the
heavens
But
matters
were
coming
to
a
climax
If
Miss
Brew
ster
had
defined
my
wishes
given
them
pith
and
point
where
great
writers
on
whom
I
leaned
did
not
it
was
be
cause
her
book
touched
responsive
chords
This
con
tinuing
explanation
of
mine
must
strike
you
as
an
apology
for
my
native
indecision
and
as
Leslie
Stephen
says
An
apology
sometimes
is
worse
than
a
satire
Further
to
muddle
my
affairs
was
a
disinclination
to
make
money
My
father
often
declared
that
if
I
saw
a
ten-dollar
bill
coming
to
greet
me
I
would
run
away
I
have
changed
since
then
I
like
money
Who
doesn
t
I
spend
it
believing
that
it
s
bad
luck
to
save
But
to
pass
our
interval
between
two
eternities
raking
in
gold
is
simply
absurd
to
me
I
have
always
worked
for
leisure
to
waste
time
I
know
of
some
families
not
bohemian
in
their
habits
who
are
never
more
than
a
few
dollars
ahead
dur
ing
their
lifetime
I
am
in
that
class
living
from
day
to
day
on
the
industry
of
my
pen
It
seems
ridiculous
and
it
is
perilous
Life
at
best
is
a
dangerous
adventure
and
I
think
that
the
modern
gladiator
should
change
the
old
formula
and
cry
in
the
arena
O
Death
those
who
are
about
to
live
salute
thee
Schopenhauer
who
has
been
wittily
described
by
Paul
Bourget
as
Chamfort
a
la
choucroute
argued
that
philosophers
more
than
other
men
should
have
means
ample
enough
to
allow
them
leisure
It
is
time
not
money
that
is
the
true
treasure
of
life
Our
sole
recompense
is
to
have
lived
but
to
have
lived
as
we
elect
not
as
the
other
fellow
tells
us
to
Ay
there
s
the
rub
And
as
there
is
nothing
so
much
to
be
feared
as
fear
of
fear
then
money
is
the
sol
vent
Without
it
you
fear
yes
fear
I
dodged
my
duties
like
the
moral
skulker
that
I
was
not
knowing
then
that
the
hawthorn
must
grow
with
the
spirit
of
the
triangle
in
it
else
not
be
hawthorn
that
the
honey-harp
the
bee
as
Thoreau
calls
it
remains
valiantly
a
bee
till
its
final
exit
to
honey-heaven
But
I
didn
t
moralise
dur
ing
the
middle
seventies
I
roared
like
a
serpent
and
hissed
like
a
lion
a
clothes-line
and
I
avoided
every
op
portunity
where
money
might
be
acquired
I
see
now
it
was
because
of
my
absorption
in
a
few
ideas
which
to-day
I
repudiate
The
leopard
does
change
its
spots
once
in
a
while
despite
the
adage
Suddenly
I
decided
that
life
held
nothing
so
precious
as
Paris
To
help
matters
along
I
offered
myself
as
a
clerk
in
a
piano
house
It
was
the
Chickering
piano
agency
at
the
corner
of
Chestnut
and
Thirteenth
Streets
where
Wanamaker
s
now
stands
Mr
William
D
Dut
ton
still
spry
and
little
changed
by
the
passing
of
forty
years
was
associated
with
his
father
William
H
Dutton
in
the
business
It
was
a
pleasant
wareroom
I
arrived
at
6
A
M
went
to
the
basement
and
two
hours
later
after
my
travail
with
finger
exercises
and
Czerny
studies
I
was
ready
for
the
day
s
toil
It
was
light
Young
Mr
Dutton
who
had
a
flair
for
the
artistic
played
the
piano
with
taste
and
possessed
an
excellent
technique
His
father
a
handsome
old
gentleman
with
a
fresh
com
plexion
would
say
as
his
son
played
He
studied
the
Hummel
school
It
s
the
only
one
That
is
true
it
is
the
only
one
in
which
to
acquire
pearly
scales
but
it
is
otherwise
inadequate
When
customers
entered
I
had
to
accost
them
Once
I
was
showing
off
my
paces
on
a
second-hand
instrument
before
a
prospective
purchaser
a
woman
whose
face
expressed
repugnance
Mr
Dut
ton
supervened
James
he
suggested
clean
that
case
with
the
feather-duster
I
ll
show
the
lady
the
piano
and
he
began
playing
Gottschalk
s
Cradle
Song
with
a
touch
that
melted
her
heart
She
bought
the
piano
After
she
went
away
he
said
to
me
with
a
characteristic
glance
over
his
eye-glasses
It
all
depends
on
the
way
it
s
done
young
man
If
your
touch
is
too
truthful
with
a
shaky
old
piano
you
will
never
sell
it
It
was
a
grand
lesson
in
worldly
ethics
for
me
I
never
forgot
it
And
when
I
read
Ibsen
s
statement
that
all
truths
grow
old
or
stale
after
twenty
years
I
think
of
Mr
Dutton
and
his
second-hand
piano
Our
America
is
here
or
nowhere
says
the
poet
We
are
the
supermen
Why
wait
for
another
century
to
prove
it
u
You
must
live
in
the
present
launch
your
self
on
any
wave
find
your
eternity
in
each
moment
I
hadn
t
read
Thoreau
then
but
Irish-like
I
determined
to
take
the
bull
by
both
the
horns
of
dilemma
I
was
like
the
poet
s
cloud
which
moveth
altogether
if
it
moves
at
all
I
actually
sickened
for
Paris
It
was
in
Prussian
War
France

me
Why
not
steal
away
between
two
days
sail
to
Paris
see
Liszt
and
die
The
Liszt
cult
was
strong
in
our
household
For
my
mother
he
was
the
Abbe
Liszt
for
my
father
a
gro
tesque
daddy-long-legs
or
a
centipede
His
picture
showed
us
one
of
those
faces
that
had
become
hardened
in
the
pitiless
glare
of
the
public
glance
Nevertheless
he
was
a
cult
and
a
cult
as
has
been
wisely
remarked
is
always
annoying
to
those
who
do
not
join
in
it
and
generally
hurtful
to
those
who
do
But
oh
to
see
him
to
hear
him
play
I
began
to
manoeuvre
I
sold
my
beloved
books
I
parted
with
my
pictures
I
scraped
and
saved
and
stared
in
the
windows
of
steamship
offices
It
was
to
be
a
stealthy
departure
an
egotistic
elopement
with
a
melancholy
alibi
of
the
soul
At
last
I
was
to
Drive
a
straight
furrow
and
come
to
the
true
measure
of
man
I
had
been
reading
Theocritus
his
Hylas
To
attain
the
necessary
courage
I
became
reticent
avoided
my
friends
and
family
Anyone
with
a
half
eye
would
have
noted
my
nervous
behaviour
and
watched
me
That
was
precisely
what
happened
I
packed
my
few
clothes
in
a
handbag
and
was
caught
in
the
act
by
my
brother
Paul
who
always
realistic
asked
What
s
her
name
Art
I
might
have
replied
but
with
Macchia
vellian
casuistry
asked
him
in
turn
Who
won
the
game
to-day
Finally
I
boldly
marched
into
the
agency
of
the
French
line
and
bought
for
28
a
ticket
in
the
fourth
class
of
the
Canada
sailing
September
25
You
may
forget
the
name
of
your
divorced
wife
but
your
first
ocean
trip
never
That
is
if
you
are
a
person
of
sentiment
I
expected
to
make
a
clean
getaway
as
they
say
in
superior
criminal
circles
but
I
was
balked
and
by
my
own
imprudence
Early
in
the
morning
the
steamer
was
to
leave
New
York
about
2
P
M
I
awoke
my
parents
and
told
them
of
my
plan
They
consented
with
suspicious
alacrity
after
interposing
the
usual
objections
my
youth
my
health
I
had
still
have
the
constitution
of
an
ox
knock
wood
It
was
settled
Rejoicing
I
awoke
my
brother
who
made
comments
unfit
to
print
At
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
station
then
at
Thirty-second
and
Market
Streets
a
few
friends
saw
us
off
I
was
in
the
custody
of
brother
John
Alfredo
Barili
among
the
rest
New
York
reached
I
went
on
board
Ring
down
the
curtain
on
old
Phila
delphia
I
have
written
enough
to
give
you
a
fair
idea
of
my
mental
and
physical
characteristics
so
that
you
will
judge
the
critic
as
he
should
be
This
is
the
method
suggested
by
Hennequin
of
which
I
told
you
A
moral
precis
of
the
critic
and
a
peep
at
his
temperament
then
much
that
is
dark
becomes
light
As
for
the
modesty
of
the
method
Such
a
monster
as
a
modest
author
does
not
exist
Perhaps
one
is
mentioned
in
history
but
he
was
so
morbidly
modest
that
he
forgot
to
write
his
book
Therefore
accept
my
chattering
as
a
thing
to
be
expected
I
am
an
optimist
at
bottom
with
a
superficial
coating
of
pessimism
which
thaws
near
a
piano
a
pretty
girl
or
a
glass
of
Pilsner
Without
hope
it
is
impossible
to
achieve
the
hopeless
I
believe
that
anyone
who
has
sung
a
song
of
hope
has
his
prayer
answered
indeed
William
James
has
said
that
no
prayer
is
unanswered
when
it
is
uttered
the
relief
liberation
of
nervous
energy
is
instantaneous
But
I
loathe
the
fixed
grin
on
the
faces
of
those
cheerful
humbugs
adherents
of
cheerful
cults
pollyannas
and
other
bores
These
people
want
you
to
be
happy
against
your
will
Time
works
prodigies
but
the
hypocrite
never
dies
Les

Jomini
and
this
must
be
not
alone
in
the
battle
field
but
in
peaceful
life
charlatans
are
always
in
the
majority
charlatans
and
imbeciles
I
have
spent
my
life
in
tilting
at
them
and
at
times
I
am
afraid
to
look
at
the
mirror
Maeterlinck
asks
Are
you
of
those
who
name
or
only
repeat
names
I
fear
I
am
one
of
the
repeaters
No
man
is
a
hero
to
his
wife
if
they
have
been
married
long
enough
and
I
think
that
no
writer
should
be
a
hero
to
his
readers
It
is
an
impressive
pose
that
of
omniscience
or
lofty
morals
But
a
whited
sepulchre
is
soon
deprived
of
its
whitewash
If
a
critic
can
t
be
human
then
let
him
become
a
pedicure
or
a
bugologist
Swinburne
said
I
have
never
been
able
to
see
what
should
attract
a
man
to
the
profession
of
criticism
but
the
noble
pleasure
of
praising
and
then
he
went
out
and
slew
his
enemies
critics
and
authors
by
the
hun
dreds
He
had
the
most
vitriolic
pen
in
England
It
sounds
magnanimous
but
neither
praise
nor
blame
should
be
the
goal
of
the
critic
To
spill
his
own
soul
that
should
be
his
aim
Notwithstanding
the
talk
about
objective
criticism
no
such
abstraction
is
thinkable
A
critic
re
lates
his
prejudices
nothing
more
It
is
well
to
possess
prejudices
They
lend
to
life
a
meaning
For
example
consider
my
eclecticism
In
Edgar
Quinet
s
romance
Merlin
we
read
of
a
visit
made
by
the
magician
to
Prester
John
at
his
abbey
This
abbey
is
an
astounding
conglomeration
of
architectures
pagoda
mosque
ba
silica
Greek
temple
synagogue
cathedral
Byzantine
and
Gothic
chapels
minarets
towers
turrets
in
bewilder
ing
array
Prester
John
is
a
venerable
man
with
a
long
white
beard
Upon
his
head
he
wore
a
turban
with
a
sapphire
cross
At
his
neck
hung
a
golden
crescent
and
he
supported
himself
upon
a
staff
after
the
manner
of
a
Brahmin
Three
children
followed
him
who
carried
each
upon
the
breast
an
open
book
The
first
was
the
collection
of
the
Vedas
the
second
was
the
Bible
the
third
the
Koran
At
certain
moments
Prester
John
stopped
and
read
a
few
lines
from
one
of
the
sacred
volumes
after
which
he
continued
his
walk
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
stars
Of
course
he
stumped
his
toe
against
the
actual
as
do
all
mystics
Eclectic
is
my
taste
in
creeds
and
cultures
And
in
cultured
eclecticism
may
be
found
the
shallows
and
depths
defects
and
virtues
of
our
times
I
am
the
child
of
my
century
and
can
echo
Mallarme

But
I
had
set
my
feet
upon
the
trail
of
Bohemia
the
fabulous
sea-coast
that
lures
most
men
You
may
be
as
prudish
as
an
oyster
as
patient
as
a
prostitute
as
sober
as
a
Judge
naturally
a
Judge
who
doesn
t
drink
but
you
shall
not
escape
a
touch
of
lunar
folly
when
young
girls
sometimes
with
the
seal
of
their
solitudes
see
the
moon
in
company
with
their
sweethearts
little
shocks
without
words
not
by
Mendelssohn
but
it
suffices
for
the
lads
to
see
the
girls
My
moonshine
came
from
the
Seven
Arts
they
are
indigenous
to
Bohemia
Where
is
Bohemia
Is
it
a
state
not
of
soul
but
of
the
purse
Perhaps
again
I
was
to
discover
it
through
disenchanting
experience
Later
I
knew
that
there
is
only
one
way
to
become
a
perfect
Bohemian
lead
the
existence
of
a
sober
sedentary
bourgeois
with
cobbler
s
wax
on
your
chair
grease
on
your
elbow
sweat
on
your
brow
and
what
the
metaphysicians
call
the
Will-to-Sit
Still
Then
you
may
write
a
book
master
music
or
play
on
your
intellectual
instrument
to
perfection
as
Henry
James
puts
it
But
I
hear
the

All

PART
II
PARIS
FORTY
YEARS
AGO
I
M
AFLOAT
Behold
me
afloat
at
last
on
that
good
old
tub
long
since
sent
to
the
scrap-heap
the
Canada
of
the
Com
pagnie
Generale
Transatlantique
with
my
heart
full
of
hope
my
eyes
turned
eastward
my
wallet
not
too
heavy
and
few
clothes
My
brother
John
took
aside
the
chief
steward
of
the
quatrieme
classe
and
tipped
him
A
swift
survey
had
told
him
that
I
was
in
for
trouble
and
perhaps
he
thought
it
would
open
my
eyes
all
the
sooner
to
realities
That
fourth-class
on
the
outward-bound
steamship
politely
masked
its
true
name
it
was
the
steerage
nothing
more
nothing
less
At
the
age
of
thirty
I
would
have
revolted
at
the
smells
the
dirt
the
promiscuity
but
youth
swallows
trouble
and
I
was
not
disgusted
It
was
life
And
I
meant
to
live
It
soon
proved
to
be
life
of
all
sorts
We
slept
in
bunks
not
beds
with
no
protection
from
the
prying
gaze
of
neigh
bours
Our
steward
rigged
up
a
calico
curtain
for
my
couch
as
if
I
were
a
girl
The
men
made
rude
com
mentaries
We
were
segregated
the
women
were
across
the
corridor
When
I
read
Stevenson
s
Amateur
Emi
grant
I
admired
his
art
though
wondered
at
his
dodging
of
disagreeable
details
His
description
is
rose-coloured
But
a
steerage
even
the
best
and
the
French
Line
was
not
so
bad
as
the
worst
is
horrible
I
confess
when
bed
time
came
that
I
was
rather
blue
about
the
gills
The
smell
a
medley
of
bad
tobacco
alcohol
unwashed
bodies
vile
breaths
phew
I
must
have
been
copper-lined
and
riveted
to
stand
the
combination
Every
port-hole
was
closed
we
had
struck
a
bit
of
rough
water
and
the
wind
was
freshening
The
gabbling
died
away
Lights
were
out
I
clutched
my
pocketbook
and
fell
into
a
doze
It
didn
t
last
noises
awoke
me
The
ship
was
pitching
and
oh
brethren
what
followed
I
shan
t
record
except
one
word
seasickness
I
ve
crossed
forty
odd
times
and
never
have
I
been
in
fair
weather
or
foul
seasick
That
night
tried
my
nerves
I
went
on
deck
to
escape
nausea
and
at
once
felt
better
My
nose
had
nearly
proved
me
coward
Next
morning
I
sought
the
head
steward
and
asked
him
why
I
was
covered
with
little
red
spots
He
at
once
explained
that
the
salt
air
affected
the
blood
that
but
I
interrupted
the
salt
air
doesn
t
run
over
the
bed
with
legs
does
it
My
crudeness
made
him
blush
Ah
Monsieur
he
deprecatingly
replied
some
things
must
be
The
fare
is
cheap
and
if
you
find
certain
other
passengers
well
the
company
doesn
t
charge
extra
for
their
passage
It
was
now
my
turn
to
blush
I
was
drop-ripe
in
my
verdancy
but
the
cynicism
of
this
elderly
person
pained
me
What
a
rascal
he
was
He
plundered
me
of
my
five-franc
pieces
whether
in
making
change
or
charging
for
extras
tobacco
coffee
The
wine
was
free
It
was
also
poisonous
I
ordered
a
better
vintage
a
vin
bleu
that
rasped
my
throat
but
I
could
get
it
down
When
I
saw
the
sea
it
was
as
flat
as
a
temperance
lecture
I
was
disappointed
because
of
its
wet
monotony
I
quoted
Landor
to
help
me
out
Is
this
the
mighty
ocean
is
this
all
Like
the
girl
in
the
Stendhal
novel
who
found
love
insipid
I
felt
like
asking
Is
that
all
I
wished
for
this
same
monotony
a
week
later
when
we
nosed
into
a
gale
that
kept
us
under
cover
for
two
days
swept
a
seaman
into
the
water
and
banged
things
generally
Then
I
saw
my
fellow
travellers
with
out
their
daily
posing
A
ship
is
the
same
all
over
as
far
as
human
nature
is
concerned
The
first
day
I
had
walked
the
decks
and
was
not
held
up
at
the
various
barriers
because
I
may
have
been
better
dressed
than
my
companions
but
the
second
day
out
I
was
asked
for
my
ticket
and
peremptorily
bidden
to
go
to
the
deck
below
I
resented
the
manner
of
the
chap
who
wasn
t
precisely
rough
but
as
I
thought
too
sharp
Did
he
take
me
for
the
cattle
herded
forward
I
soon
learned
that
when
you
travel
fourth-class
you
are
considered
fourth-class
with
all
its
implications
It
was
my
first
contact
with
social
distinctions
I
didn
t
like
it
The
third
and
fourth
class
mingled
on
the
same
deck
though
we
ate
and
slept
apart
second-class
was
almost
aristo
cratic
first-class
in
the
empyrean
After
I
had
been
turned
out
of
first-class
I
sat
down
on
the
second
deck
this
time
I
was
chased
away
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
my
fourth-class
contemporaries
I
was
ignorant
of
rules
but
they
thought
I
was
putting
on
airs
and
therefore
de
served
a
rebuke
but
as
I
didn
t
attempt
to
play
the
dis
guised
nobleman
or
reduced
gentleman
I
was
soon
re
ceived
into
the
guild
of
dirt
and
poverty
as
if
I
belonged
there
I
did
I
was
presently
as
unkempt
as
my
asso
ciates
I
sported
a
Scotch
cap
went
collarless
wore
a
flannel
shirt
and
my
hands
and
face
did
not
shine
from
soap
I
defy
anyone
to
keep
neat
in
such
circumstances
The
crowd
wasn
t
a
bad
one
it
was
poor
and
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
wash
Personal
dirti
ness
is
the
real
and
permanent
dividing
line
of
classes
there
is
no
social
equality
between
the
clean
and
dirty
The
question
of
physical
purity
lies
at
the
root
of
the
real
democratic
problem
wrote
Havelock
Ellis
Clean
liness
is
greater
than
godliness
and
I
have
always
noted
that
the
more
superstitious
a
religion
the
filthier
its
fol
lowers
What
surprises
me
now
is
to
remember
with
what
ease
I
reflected
the
colour
a
black
and
tan
of
the
society
in
which
I
found
myself
There
was
the
usual
mixture
A
dozen
black-sheep
some
members
of
good
families
who
left
home
in
disgrace
because
of
gambling
debts
or
women
scandals
and
were
returning
in
a
still
more
disgraceful
state
Then
there
were
a
half-dozen
families
who
had
saved
enough
to
retire
to
their
own
departments
in
the
provinces
and
live
en
bourgeois
a
dream
realised
Two
theological
students
on
their
way
to
Rome
via
Paris
added
variety
to
the
personnel
I
must
explain
that
they
like
the
families
I
speak
of
were
in
the
third-class
Economy
was
their
shibboleth
As
I
seemed
fairly
decent
I
brushed
my
hair
every
day
I
was
admitted
though
not
without
reservations
into
the
aristocracy
of
the
steerage
Our
voyage
was
not
unpleasant
even
in
Hades
good
company
counts
The
early
rising
was
the
worst
part
of
the
day
the
sleeping
quarters
smelled
to
heaven
but
once
on
deck
life
became
bearable
That
first
breakfast
a
bowl
of
coffee
and
a
stale
roll
how
it
went
down
The
waiting
between
meals
was
trying
to
healthy
young
stomachs
Soup
boiled
beef
beans
a
litre
of
wine
and
bread
at
dis
cretion
I
ate
it
by
the
yard
comprised
the
second
breakfast
better
was
the
dinner
a
function
as
well
as
a
feed
We
had
a
roast
of
some
kind
fresh
vegetables
and
more
wine
without
that
blessed
wine
the
food
would
have
gone
begging
The
promenade
on
deck
was
quite
fashionable
I
have
many
times
since
watched
such
perambulations
from
an
upper
deck
now
I
was
one
of
the
dramatis
personse
We
had
no
smoking-room
hud
dling
in
the
corridors
when
the
weather
was
unfavourable
Have
you
noticed
that
a
war
a
calamity
brings
humanity
to
a
common
level
What
cared
we
if
the
upper-decks
looked
down
at
us
condescendingly
We
were
the
real
passengers
the
others
only
phantoms
The
life
of
the
ship
was
also
with
us
Above
decks
he
is
known
as
the
joy
of
the
smoking-room
sometimes
he
is
a
she
Our
social
hero
was
a
suspicious
scamp
in
rags
a
polylinguist
a
cultivated
man
of
the
world
unshaven
unshorn
with
polished
manners
and
a
tongue
hung
in
the
middle
He
gave
himself
out
as
a
gold
pros
pector
from
the
West
where
he
had
staked
out
a
claim
but
inevitably
had
been
robbed
of
it
by
his
evil
part
ners
while
he
was
sick
with
fever
In
fact
the
old
legend
and
related
with
such
authority
such
a
profusion
of
details
that
he
won
our
respect
and
was
nicknamed
the
millionaire
He
borrowed
our
cigarettes
our
wine
our
loose
cash
Had
he
not
an
uncle
a
wealthy
banker
in
the
Rue
de
Provence
When
our
passage
tickets
were
collected
he
disappeared
I
fancy
he
had
bribed
the
steward
certainly
he
was
a
stowaway
But
he
bore
a
charmed
life
and
only
once
did
I
see
him
discomfited
He
had
made
a
jesting
remark
about
religion
to
the
theological
students
and
found
himself
sprawling
on
the
deck
one
of
the
pair
a
husky
Irish
lad
with
a
fist
of
iron
had
knocked
the
farceur
down
A
sadly
black
eye
kept
him
quiet
for
a
few
hours
and
then
he
sought
our
sympathy
by
pointing
to
the
swollen
pouch
under
his
eye
and
gaily
declaring
that
he
received
it
in
a
worthy
cause
pour
le
bon
Jesus-Christ
but
the
students
were
always
on
the
other
side
of
the
boat
when
he
ven
tured
on
this
sorry
witticism
IN
PARIS
AT
LAST
We
entered
the
roads
of
Havre
October
6
and
the
next
day
we
were
in
Paris
Havre
detained
us
because
the
chief
steward
with
the
favoris
side
whiskers
wished
to
show
us
that
city
It
was
my
first
taste
of
French
life
Everything
seemed
miraculous
Not
only
had
I
the
innocence
of
the
eye
but
an
innocent
palate
the
native
cuisine
opened
my
eyes
as
well
as
my
throat
Cookery
too
is
one
of
the
Seven
Arts
The
French
have
made
it
an
art
We
went
to
a
gingerbread
fair
an
imitation
of
the
fair
at
Vincennes
and
sought
our
beds
in
a
condition
of
inflamed
sobriety
I
remember
lean
ing
from
the
window
of
my
wretched
little
bedroom
and
listening
to
a
woman
singing
in
the
back
alley
She
had
tears
in
her
voice
and
her
voice
was
riddled
by
rum
I
fell
asleep
in
a
fever
of
contentment
which
even
the
awakening
in
a
chilly
drab
dawn
did
not
dispel
After
a
bowl
of
onion
soup
the
regulation
remedy
we
boarded
our
train
third-class
compartments
I
had
gone
up
in
the
social
scale
had
mounted
just
one
rung
on
the
ladder
Drizzling
rain
fell
as
we
entered
the
Gare
St
Lazare
at
five
o
clock
in
the
evening
Paris
after
we
had
passed
the
bridge
of
the
BatignoIIes
was
not
very
attractive
Those
high
tenements
they
seemed
so
in
1878
as
com
pared
with
houses
in
Philadelphia
on
either
side
of
the
railroad
yards
are
still
to
be
seen
each
time
I
return
to
them
I
experience
the
same
sinking
of
the
heart
That
first
night
in
Paris
left
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
perhaps
Havre
had
something
to
do
with
it
I
had
attached
my
self
to
one
of
the
families
and
after
patrolling
the
grand
boulevard
we
found
ourselves
as
far
as
the
Boulevard
de
Sebastopol
We
had
passed
through
the
Rue
St
Lazare
and
naturally
stopped
for
a
consommation
at
some
cafe
with
tables
on
the
street
The
lights
electricity
was
coming
into
use
the
Jablochkoff
lights
on
the
Avenue
dTOpera
set
the
fashion
the
cleanliness
of
the
establishment
the
bustle
of
the
waiters
serving
thirsty
people
who
had
fresh
coloured
faces
much
im
pressed
me
Even
then
I
noted
that
the
nation
had
made
eating
and
drinking
human
Sociability
was
ra
tionalised
The
drunken
man
abounds
on
the
globe
but
less
in
Europe
than
elsewhere
Exhausted
by
the
terrible
noise
the
horns
of
the
big
buses
I
followed
in
the
wake
of
my
comrades
There
were
halts
hesitations
and
tentative
sallies
into
cheap
hotels
We
all
had
an
address
highly
recommended
and
argued
at
corners
while
I
like
one
of
those
dogs
that
follows
a
mob
till
it
falls
sat
on
my
valise
and
patiently
waited
Gendarmes
were
consulted
and
politely
showed
us
various
lodging-houses
This
amiability
on
the
part
of
policemen
set
me
to
wondering
Not
a
trace
of
hos
tility
or
surliness
It
was
Monsieur
par
ici
Mon
sieur
par
la
as
the
men
of
our
party
wrangled
with
their
wives
My
French
I
had
already
discovered
on
shipboard
was
not
the
language
spoken
in
France
I
understood
the
general
meaning
of
a
phrase
which
I
persisted
answering
in
a
loud
voice
Our
business
was
settled
by
the
diplomacy
of
a
hotel
proprietor
who
saw
that
to
a
dozen
souls
he
could
make
concessions
He
diplomatically
invited
us
to
a
drink
claret
in
bottles
this
time
and
the
ladies
said
that
he
was
tres
gentil
He
was
He
was
also
a
common
or
garden
variety
of
swindler
when
we
paid
our
bills
a
day
later
I
in
par
ticular
was
a
Iamb
led
to
the
shearing
My
wool
was
depleted
Confused
raging
I
said
a
few
things
to
him
that
astonished
my
companions
who
understood
Ameri
can
profanity
Come
come
that
s
too
strong
The
game
isn
t
worth
the
candle
Perhaps
we
are
in
the
wrong
Paris
is
much
more
expensive
than
in
1860
Thus
I
was
pacified
by
one
of
my
friends
The
French
stuck
to
their
countrymen
I
had
been
robbed
petty
larceny
of
the
meanest
sort
but
after
all
what
could
I
expect
I
was
only
a
Yankee
Thoroughly
disgusted
with
the
crowd
and
the
surroundings
I
paid
the
bill
hailed
a
fiacre
and
drove
to
Drexel
Harjes
Cie
I
had
definitely
ruptured
with
the
fourth-class
and
had
become
a
bourgeois
overnight
I
found
letters
at
the
bankers
Well-dressed
people
read
newspapers
in
the
waiting-rooms
The
place
wore
a
hospitable
air
I
was
with
my
own
race
once
more
My
letters
filled
me
with
joy
Philadelphia
became
the
pivot
of
the
planet
I
saw
my
family
through
the
senti
mental
haze
of
years
twelve
days
absence
seemed
a
century
Best
of
all
for
I
was
a
pragmatist
was
the
command
of
the
Philadelphia
Drexel
house
to
pay
me
a
certain
sum
not
much
but
a
magot
as
they
say
My
mother
I
knew
had
been
active
in
this
matter
I
ve
forgotten
my
first
evening
spent
in
Paris
with
the
immigrants
but
I
do
know
that
when
alone
I
went
to
the
Jardin
Mabille
on
the
boulevard
I
can
boast
that
I
saw
the
last
of
that
famous
establishment
though
it
was
dull
diversion
During
the
Second
Empire
it
had
entertained
the
world
with
its
wickedness
I
searched
with
the
ardour
and
curiosity
of
a
green
youth
for
that
same
wickedness
I
only
attended
its
obsequies
A
dozen
fat
stale
and
unfair
women
pranced
around
to
the
noisy
music
of
a
band
Offenbach
was
still
in
vogue
but
it
was
like
corked
champagne
this
music
The
men
dancers
looked
like
professionals
The
Latin
quarter
masquerade
wouldn
t
have
deceived
even
a
reader
of
that
bogus
bohemian
romance
Trilby
But
Trilby
was
unwritten
I
was
young
and
presently
I
was
sitting
before
the
buffet
drinking
expensive
vintages
in
company
with
an
accomplished
young
lady
of
at
least
forty-five
wear
ing
a
blonde
wig
and
a
professional
grimace
I
paid
for
the
refreshment
Garcon
deux
bocks
and
my
accent
was
so
outlandish
that
M
lle
Claire
her
real
name
she
solemnly
assured
me
forced
me
to
repeat
phrases
so
that
the
waiter
might
join
in
the
fun
Wicked
Why
the
dear
old
aunt
wasn
t
as
wicked
as
a
village-pump
She
became
maternal
and
confidently
told
me
that
as
a
fool
and
his
money
are
soon
parted
I
had
better
go
home
to
my
mamma
My
vanity
wounded
I
took
her
advice
tipped
the
waiter
ordered
a
fresh
beer
for
Claire
and
bowing
in
my
best
Gallic
manner
I
hastily
went
away
I
looked
back
as
I
turned
the
corner
The
lady
the
waiter
the
lady
cashier
at
the
desk
were
staring
in
my
direction
They
were
not
jeering
I
must
have
impressed
them
as
something
so
indescribably
provincial
that
they
held
their
breath
And
I
who
fancied
myself
rigolo
with
my
Scotch
cap
velveteen
coat
flaring
necktie
low
collar
baggy
breeches
Wasn
t
I
the
picture
of
a
Latin
quarter
student
or
artist
I
had
read
Henri
Murger
s
Vie
de
Boheme
and
believed
myself
the
real
thing
Alas
Claire
and
the
greedy
waiter
didn
t
agree
with
me
and
my
guardian
angel
being
on
the
job
I
went
to
my
hotel
in
an
irritable
humour
But
I
had
seen
the
historical
Jardin
Mabille
had
spoken
to
one
of
its
houris
and
instead
of
dazzling
wickedness
I
had
been
sent
away
with
a
sermon
in
my
ear
In
this
individual
case
Lecky
was
right
when
he
called
the
harlot
the
pro
tector
of
the
home
The
next
morning
not
feeling
in
the
least
like
a
brand
plucked
from
the
burning
I
went
to
the
friends
of
my
parents
They
had
made
a
fortune
in
Philadelphia
first
in
the
sewing-machine
industry
where
Mr
Lefevre
found
himself
an
associate
of
George
W
Childs
He
was
one
of
the
early
fashionable
dressmakers
of
the
town
and
his
imported
Worth
gowns
brought
him
fame
and
money
In
1878
he
returned
with
his
wife
an
adorable
Frenchwoman
and
children
to
Paris
and
lived
up
in
the
Quarter
of
Europe
which
is
at
the
top
of
the
Rue
de
Rome
and
close
to
the
boulevards
BatignoIIes
and
Clichy
I
was
received
with
open
arms
Letters
had
evidently
preceded
me
My
education
was
taken
in
hand
and
I
was
not
allowed
to
speak
English
so
I
spent
the
day
mumbling
my
Broad
Street
Academy
French
Mr
Lefevre
one
of
those
natty
Parisians
white-bearded
and
insouciant
who
are
gay
at
four-score
he
wasn
t
much
over
sixty
first
showed
me
the
town
But
he
was
less
interested
in
the
architecture
statues
the
Louvre
or
Cluny
than
in
the
passing
crowd
He
was
a
seasoned
inhabitant
and
registered
many
nuances
for
me
in
moral
and
physical
Paris
I
learned
not
only
classes
and
masses
but
salient
characteristics
of
the
day
and
night
life
We
went
all
over
the
city
I
became
a
cockney
a
badaud
I
knew
both
sides
of
the
river
the
exterior
boulevards
the
faubourgs
Above
all
I
became
intimately
ac
quainted
with
the
interior
of
churches
The
Lefevres
were
religious
Every
day
I
was
trotted
to
church
and
as
every
other
day
is
Saint
s
day
in
France
I
often
went
to
High
Mass
At
first
it
was
St
Augustin
then
the
Trinity
I
compromised
on
a
chapel
in
the
vicinity
St
Marie
des
BatignoIIes
I
hadn
t
come
to
Paris
for
its
piety
The
enforced
visits
confessions
and
other
com
mendable
practices
were
irksome
in
the
end
and
I
re
belled
The
Lefevre
family
moved
to
the
country
and
I
was
left
to
my
own
devices
though
I
gladly
visited
them
at
Villiers-Ie-Bel
on
the
northern
railroad
Ma
dame
Lefevre
was
solicitous
about
the
state
of
my
soul
she
had
promised
my
mother
to
look
after
me
when
if
the
truth
be
told
my
soul
wasn
t
worth
the
powder
to
blow
it
to
Halifax
I
kicked
over
the
traces
and
deter
mined
to
live
my
own
life
as
they
say
in
Ibsen
plays
And
a
nice
mess
I
made
of
matters
Ill
THE
MAISON
BERNARD
As
I
only
had
a
small
allowance
I
could
not
live
where
I
should
have
lived
It
was
Mr
Lefevre
who
found
me
lodging
in
an
old
barracks
on
the
Rue
Puteaux
No
5
off
the
BatignoIIes
boulevard
It
was
kept
by
a
dwarf
hunchback
with
flaming
eyes
and
tumbled
hair
The
house
was
not
inviting
in
aspect
or
cleanliness
I
was
assigned
a
small
chamber
on
the
top
floor
fifth
story
The
room
barely
accommodated
a
bed
wash-stand
armoire
the
glass
of
which
filled
me
with
pride
my
modest
clothes
and
a
tiny
upright
piano
made
by
an
Alsatian
manufacturer
I
think
Kriegelstein
was
the
name
Later
a
second-hand
stove
was
bought
and
I
was
in
daily
danger
of
burning
the
house
down
when
I
made
a
fire
really
a
big
smoke
and
a
roaring
sound
of
flames
for
ten
minutes
I
ranged
my
few
precious
books
on
the
sill
of
my
solitary
window
I
looked
over
a
gar
den
and
the
usual
array
of
chimney-pots
The
climate
was
then
as
it
always
is
abominable
in
Paris
Gay
Paris
is
a
figment
of
fiction
writers
The
gaiety
is
in
the
hearts
of
the
inhabitants
not
in
the
leaden
skies
The
cold
of
winter
is
more
penetrating
than
ours
because
it
is
damp
because
the
sun
seldom
shines
because
houses
are
not
heated
as
in
America
Rain
is
the
daily
programme
Fall
and
winter
are
always
wet
Spring
is
the
best
period
for
summer
notwithstanding
the
popular
belief
to
the
contrary
is
hot
sticky
and
uncomfortable
all
the
more
so
since
baths
are
for
the
well-to-do
Forty
years
ago
this
was
the
rule
The
old
apartments
had
no
con
veniences
I
paid
the
munificent
sum
of
fifteen
francs
a
week
for
my
room
and
as
my
income
didn
t
go
higher
than
five
francs
a
day
I
hadn
t
much
left
Indeed
a
period
of
hardship
set
in
I
was
to
learn
the
exact
value
of
five
centimes
and
how
to
make
that
amount
go
as
far
as
possible
I
forgot
to
say
that
bed-linen
was
not
included
in
my
weekly
rental
The
landlord
whose
name
was
Ber
nard
was
an
Alsatian
and
lived
in
the
house
He
sup
plied
wine
and
table-board
to
his
lodgers
At
first
I
ate
at
cheap
restaurants
gargottes
places
frequented
by
coachmen
workmen
or
in
wine
houses
where
for
a
fixed
price
you
were
given
a
copious
bouillon
I
don
t
think
the
Duval
establishments
were
then
in
existence
boiled
beef
and
carrots
one
potato
and
a
big
bottle
of
cheap
wine
for
the
sum
of
one
franc
Those
were
not
expensive
times
France
was
rapidly
recovering
from
the
shock
of
the
war
with
Prussia
and
prosperity
filled
hearts
with
hope
In
my
new
home
there
was
an
old
couple
the
Grand
jeans
he
a
retired
functionary
living
on
a
small
pension
she
after
a
half
century
of
petty
economies
and
married
life
a
brave
and
devoted
wife
They
had
one
pleasure
left
On
Sundays
they
dined
en
ville
with
their
son
and
his
family
They
were
very
proud
of
him
He
too
was
a
government
employee
who
bid
fair
to
tread
in
the
snail
trail
of
his
father
One
thing
disquieted
the
worthy
pair
Their
son
had
two
children
the
regulation
num
ber
of
a
French
household
it
was
the
prospect
of
addi
tions
that
made
the
grandmother
unhappy
Ah
Mon
sieur
she
would
say
to
me
on
the
landing
when
we
got
our
water-supply
my
daughter-in-law
is
again
a
troubled
woman
Another
mouth
to
feed
I
was
duly
sympa
thetic
On
Sundays
they
would
mount
the
long
flight
of
stairs
at
nine
o
clock
and
I
could
tell
from
their
up
ward
march
whether
matters
had
gone
awry
Please
don
t
think
I
was
a
Paul
Pry
snooping
about
my
neighbours
affairs
the
truth
is
I
left
my
door
open
to
get
more
liberty
as
I
was
in
narrow
quarters
I
usually
finished
dressing
in
the
hall
When
I
played
more
than
ten
hours
a
day
on
the
tinpan
piano
I
was
reminded
that
other
people
had
their
rights
by
a
volley
of
old
shoes
or
loud
cries
of
get
out
and
such
expressions
of
dis
pleasure
I
was
too
superior
too
absorbed
to
bother
with
these
unmusical
persons
The
Grandjeans
were
politer
Madame
told
me
that
my
practice
made
her
dream
of
the
siege
when
the
Prussians
bombarded
the
city
I
thanked
her
I
went
on
long
walks
with
her
husband
who
escorted
me
to
the
Pantheon
the
Invalides
the
Tuileries
all
the
public
buildings
and
monuments
One
afternoon
after
I
had
seen
the
reparations
of
the
Tuileries
I
asked
how
long
it
had
been
before
the
Prussians
evacuated
Paris
Ah
young
man
and
he
mournfully
shook
his
venera
ble
hand
the
boches
didn
t
do
all
that
mischief
I
re
gret
to
say
it
was
our
own
people
the
communards
Music
was
my
chief
pleasure
Hunger
was
also
a
focal
point
in
my
consciousness
I
was
not
in
actual
want
and
with
the
exercise
of
a
little
prudence
I
had
enough
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
back
door
but
he
gnawed
at
my
vitals
and
not
boasting
Spartan
fortitude
I
was
usually
famished
the
last
week
of
the
month
because
I
spent
my
allowance
too
soon
I
ate
so
much
at
the
little
wine
house
that
the
woman
who
ran
the
place
insinu
atingly
said
Monsieur
perhaps
is
suffering
from
a
tape\vorm
It
was
merely
a
delicate
hint
that
I
must
not
exceed
my
privilege
of
more
than
a
yard
of
bread
at
a
meal
a
thing
difficult
to
do
Paris
bread
in
long
sticks
is
appetising
Those
few
days
of
the
month
how
they
tested
my
stomach
I
could
have
gone
to
the
Lefevres
but
the
railway
fares
cost
too
much
and
then
I
had
a
few
sparks
of
pride
left
in
me
I
repeated
the
words
of
Turenne
but
they
weren
t
very
filling
Thou
tremblest
carcass
Many
afternoons
I
remained
in
bed
with
a
heavy
volume
of
Chopin
s
music
on
my
stomach
It
was
a
lazy
equivalent
for
the
belt
strapped
in
I
had
my
chocolate
I
smoked
and
I
read
An
unsatisfactory
pro
ceeding
this
one
full
meal
a
day
yet
I
worked
walked
was
fairly
content
Youth
The
hunchback
proprietor
was
kind
Occasionally
after
I
had
paid
my
rent
with
approximate
punctuality
he
would
invite
me
to
dejeuner
at
noon
a
royal
feast
I
never
refused
him
At
his
table
I
met
a
queer
crew
chiefly
Alsatians
German
and
French
were
spoken
without
prejudice
barring
the
pro
vincial
accent
There
were
a
half-dozen
couples
young
people
who
not
securing
their
parents
consent
had
left
home
with
their
sweethearts
and
lived
in
Paris
until
they
reached
the
age
of
twenty-five
when
they
could
marry
And
some
of
them
did
No
one
was
scandalised
They
were
all
hard-working
fairly
sober
and
the
men
had
the
courage
of
their
concubines
We
are
too
poor
to
marry
one
of
them
a
house
painter
informed
me
They
were
devoted
to
their
partners
and
the
monotonies
of
married
life
were
much
in
evidence
Even
in
the
atmospheric
adulteries
of
the
Henry
James
novels
one
may
trace
the
platitudes
of
matrimony
To
all
intents
and
purposes
these
peasants
transplanted
in
Paris
were
as
securely
bound
together
as
if
church
and
state
had
been
invoked
in
the
matter
But
after
I
had
lived
a
winter
with
them
I
detected
rifts
in
their
domestic
lutes
Papa
Bernard
was
mar
ried
to
a
midwife
who
conducted
her
establishment
across
the
Seine
She
promptly
appeared
at
dinner
time
seven
o
clock
possibly
to
look
the
boarders
over
She
had
a
ferocious
eye
for
business
Her
husband
was
hen
pecked
there
was
a
reason
Every
afternoon
he
had
a
habit
of
disappearing
I
would
keep
house
enjoying
the
snugness
and
warmth
of
the
dining-room
where
there
was
a
battered
upright
piano
After
the
maid-of-all
work
a
disreputable
young
female
would
clear
the
table
and
go
to
her
cupboard
there
to
wash
the
dishes
and
troll
out
some
obscene
song
she
had
heard
in
company
with
her
little
soldier
while
walking
around
the
fortifica
tions
I
would
play
to
drown
her
voice
Bernard
after
enduring
the
noise
would
take
off
his
wooden
sabots
and
in
his
slippers
would
steal
up-stairs
first
placing
an
index
finger
on
his
nose
in
a
significant
way
as
one
should
say
Watch
wait
tell
my
wife
I
ve
gone
out
Once
the
midwife
came
in
unexpectedly
Luckily
I
was
not
there
The
row
that
ensued
must
have
been
terrific
One
young
couple
left
the
house
the
next
morning
I
feared
to
ask
the
reason
M
Bernard
also
drank
But
I
didn
t
always
dine
luxuriously
I
continued
to
rove
and
forage
and
as
that
noble
American
institution
free-lunch
was
unknown
I
had
little
to
spare
when
rent
day
arrived
One
night
a
fellow-lodger
took
me
to
the
Halles
the
central
markets
and
after
a
tour
through
the
labyrinths
which
Zola
faithfully
describes
in
Le
Ventre
de
Paris
he
showed
me
a
trick
that
I
shall
never
forget
We
found
ourselves
behind
one
of
the
halls
with
a
dozen
vagabonds
one
in
shabby
evening
dress
and
top-boots
but
bare-headed
mostly
human
wrecks
drunkards
and
outlaws
from
society
They
were
in
jolly
mood
evidently
cognac
of
the
worst
sort
was
in
their
veins
They
were
hungry
Like
a
band
of
wolves
we
watched
a
big
cauldron
over
a
fire
in
which
sim
mered
a
mass
of
meat
and
vegetables
the
scourings
of
the
butcher
s
block
and
huckster
s
droppings
Fire
and
water
are
purifying
and
this
indescribable
olla-podrida
fumed
and
bubbled
and
sent
to
our
nostrils
a
most
tempt
ing
odour
A
human
hog
in
rags
stirred
the
pot-au-feu
with
a
baton
fit
for
a
wash
boiler
As
he
stirred
he
hoarsely
chanted
One
cent
a
try
one
cent
only
The
trial
was
this
as
the
whirling
mass
tossed
up
frag
ments
of
flesh
hunks
of
fat
potatoes
or
carrots
you
jabbed
at
them
with
a
long
wooden
fork
and
what
you
prodded
on
the
prongs
was
yours
Only
one
cent
It
would
have
been
amusing
if
it
hadn
t
been
horrible
The
gambling
instinct
as
well
as
hunger
was
appealed
to
and
the
low
price
proved
an
irresistible
combination
I
found
it
so
I
speared
like
my
neighbours
and
had
fair
luck
a
lump
of
veal
which
I
ate
with
good
appetite
No
bread
No
wine
These
we
found
across
the
street
I
never
returned
to
this
slop-bucket
lottery
It
wasn
t
necessary
my
prospects
were
decidedly
brightening
I
sent
a
letter
to
the
Philadelphia
Evening
Bulletin
and
it
was
printed
through
the
intermediacy
of
Ferdinand
Fetherston
It
was
dated
from
Paris
No
vember
14
1878
The
banal
letter
of
a
young
writer
beginning
Paris
beautiful
Paris
with
lots
of
gasps
and
exclamation
points
These
weekly
letters
lasted
till
the
following
summer
They
were
edited
by
my
mother
who
wrote
a
pure
flowing
English
as
her
writings
tell
me
I
was
in
the
torturing
grip
of
Carlyle
then
and
my
contorted
prose
shadowed
his
excesses
My
mother
warned
me
against
this
aping
of
a
great
man
s
style
and
no
doubt
would
have
approved
of
Matthew
Arnold
s
advice
to
Frederic
Harrison
Flee
Carlylese
as
the
very
devil
I
didn
t
and
concocted
tortuous
phrases
to
my
heart
s
content
Newman
was
upheld
as
a
model
of
grace
and
limpidity
but
it
was
too
early
for
the
great
cardinal
and
prose-master
However
there
was
no
great
trace
of
the
fuliginous
Carlyle
in
these
letters
To
be
frank
I
think
I
wrote
with
more
simplicity
than
now
Life
has
intervened
The
same
preoccupation
with
the
arts
may
be
found
also
the
same
speed
vocabulary
and
lack
of
sequence
We
change
less
than
we
think
and
the
child
is
sometimes
more
sincere
than
the
man
The
best
thing
about
this
new
connection
was
the
five
dollars
it
brought
with
each
contribution
Twenty-five
francs
And
remember
that
four
decades
ago
in
Paris
this
amount
almost
equalled
twenty-five
dollars
in
purchasing
power
I
was
a
nabob
when
my
monthly
cheque
arrived
I
would
stroll
into
Drexel
s
after
a
glorious
banquet
con
sisting
of
Chateaubriand
beefsteak
the
French
are
loyal
to
their
poets
and
celebrities
not
to
mention
war
vic
tories
think
of
La
Pompadour
of
Madame
Recamier
Sauce
a
la
Marengo
Mazagran
of
coffee
this
from
a
siege
in
Algiers
and
other
soups
gowns
corsets
and
desserts
washed
down
with
Burgundy
together
with
radishes
and
butter
Brussels
sprouts
cheese
and
Mocha
How
I
swaggered
home
and
boasted
of
my
dejeuner
I
gave
up
the
cheaper
restaurants
and
ate
at
the
liberal
table
of
Papa
Bernard
where
I
was
received
with
the
peculiar
consideration
accorded
newly-acquired
riches
MADAME
BEEFSTEAK
Then
I
fell
in
love
Not
a
novelty
but
each
new
girl
creates
that
illusion
It
was
hardly
a
grande
passion
this
infatuation
only
the
reactions
of
two
young
persons
thrown
together
at
a
common
place
a
Parisian
table
d
hote
Contiguity
breeds
familiarity
I
sat
next
to
a
handsome
girl
of
twenty
a
girl
who
had
been
a
bonne
She
wore
the
white
cap
of
a
servant
and
behaved
with
the
utmost
circumspection
She
lived
in
a
hall-room
on
the
floor
below
me
and
had
as
a
companion
a
nasty
yapping
dog
which
she
petted
and
called
P-pauI
after
Paul
de
Cassagnac
then
in
the
public
eye
as
a
publicist
politician
and
duellist
P-pauI
hated
me
I
loathed
the
brute
which
sat
on
the
lap
of
his
mistress
at
table
Whenever
I
spoke
to
the
young
woman
I
heard
a
growl
Nevertheless
I
talked
and
she
listened
fascinated
by
my
fluent
and
fearful
French
An
intimacy
followed
She
was
the
only
unattached
female
in
the
house
Of
her
antecedents
I
knew
little
She
told
me
that
her
bap
tismal
name
was
Coralie
that
s
all
M
Bernard
would
slyly
smile
at
us
the
boarders
took
our
friendship
as
a
matter
of
course
Yet
we
never
met
except
at
the
mid
day-breakfast
and
at
dinner
Even
Mother
Bernard
with
her
beak
of
a
bird
of
prey
would
regard
us
with
a
shrewd
eye
Heaven
knows
why
She
may
have
been
anticipating
future
events
So
platonic
was
my
inter
course
with
Coralie
that
when
I
innocently
invited
her
to
hear
a
little
music
sitting
in
the
hall
be
it
under
stood
as
my
room
wasn
t
large
enough
for
two
she
re
fused
rather
testily
I
thought
telling
me
that
M
Bernard
was
very
strict
regarding
the
morals
of
his
household
the
infernal
hypocrite
but
couldn
t
we
take
a
little
promenade
some
afternoon
Now
suspicious
reader
you
must
not
imagine
anything
wicked
Those
guilty
asterisks
much
admired
by
novelists
and
suggest
ing
naughtiness
I
shall
not
use
for
the
reason
that
we
never
promenaded
It
wasn
t
necessary
I
disliked
her
animal
and
the
only
time
she
went
out
of
doors
was
to
give
P-paul
necessary
exercise
Her
eyes
Coralie
s
were
large
and
like
hard-boiled
eggs
She
had
a
well
shaped
head
regular
features
scarlet
lips
and
tiny
ears
Small
ears
are
the
shepherd
s
warning
morning
or
even
ing
In
a
woman
they
spell
selfishness
and
a
selfish
man
should
never
marry
a
woman
like
himself
This
I
told
myself
as
I
looked
at
Coralie
Uselessly
for
I
lost
my
head
and
made
love
to
her
My
tactics
were
simple
I
had
observed
her
fondness
for
rare
beefsteak
an
unusual
taste
in
a
Frenchwoman
I
treated
her
every
day
to
beefsteak
It
went
on
my
bill
and
the
bone
belonged
to
the
dog
Soon
I
paid
for
her
dejeuner
but
halted
there
She
hinted
at
hard
luck
at
dinners
not
within
the
compass
of
her
purse
I
was
obdurate
Had
I
not
grazed
star
vation
All
went
well
till
spring
Then
I
experienced
a
surprise
The
family
had
nicknamed
her
Madame
Bifsteck
be
cause
of
her
carnivorous
propensity
and
by
consequence
I
was
called
Monsieur
Beefsteak
The
dog
remained
plain
dog
till
his
next
sausage
karma
With
warmer
weather
my
stove
became
an
impediment
because
of
it
I
was
forced
to
put
on
my
shirt
in
the
hall
A
burst
of
generosity
made
me
offer
it
to
Madame
Bifsteck
Her
eyes
shone
like
glorious
lamps
I
was
assured
that
she
loved
me
I
paid
for
another
rare
steak
We
were
almost
happy
And
then
came
the
disagreeable
surprise
One
evening
after
dinner
as
we
sipped
our
liqueurs
a
burly
coachman
entered
whip
in
hand
and
saluted
the
company
A
swift
exchange
of
glances
It
s
her
hus
band
some
one
whispered
to
me
Le
mari
that
name
consecrated
by
melodrama
My
Coralie
s
husband
Horrible
He
was
nearly
seven
feet
high
weighed
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
at
least
wore
the
capes
and
glazed
high
hat
of
his
profession
and
also
the
professional
red
mug
He
was
drunk
indeed
was
never
sober
and
odd
to
relate
when
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
I
expected
to
hear
a
rich
Irish
brogue
so
much
like
a
Dublin
jaunt
ing-car
driver
did
he
look
But
he
spoke
French
mixed
with
the
argot
of
the
quarter
An
awe-inspiring
creature
I
had
been
sitting
with
my
arm
around
the
waist
of
Coralie
having
lulled
the
jealousy
of
P-paul
with
a
bone
Unostentatiously
I
withdrew
this
incriminating
arm
when
I
learned
the
title
of
the
stranger
What
Had
my
Coralie
Bifsteck
fooled
me
all
along
Oh
grass
where
is
thy
greenness
Oh
beef
where
is
thy
price
I
didn
t
have
an
opportunity
to
ponder
the
situation
The
big
devil
looked
at
me
and
to
my
terror
strode
yes
he
had
plenty
of
stride
towards
me
Ah
Monsieur
Stove
it
s
you
Embrace
your
papa
young
man
He
held
me
in
a
grip
of
steel
Mr
Stove
What
did
he
mean
I
had
been
saluted
as
Beefsteak
never
as
Stove
His
bear-like
hug
nearly
smothered
me
I
was
hopelessly
out
classed
from
the
start
The
audience
tittered
but
soon
became
silent
It
was
to
be
serious
Suddenly
after
a
volley
of
objurgations
I
was
tripped
up
and
found
my
self
across
his
knees
and
next
to
his
wife
She
placidly
stared
like
a
cow
in
a
thunder-shower
Then
I
was
ignominiously
spanked
spanked
as
my
father
never
dreamed
of
spanking
me
The
family
roared
with
laughter
The
Bernards
only
smiled
It
was
a
joke
This
M
Stove
was
such
a
funny
fellow
At
the
word
Stove
la
poele
the
gaiety
redoubled
I
didn
t
feel
much
like
a
hero
when
I
was
set
on
my
feet
my
hair
mussed
my
eye
blinking
But
I
hadn
t
seen
how
could
I
face
down
the
series
of
winks
bestowed
on
the
spectators
M
Bifsteck
to
give
him
a
name
was
as
jovial
a
pirate
as
one
could
meet
cruising
about
that
most
adventurous
of
seas
the
streets
of
Paris
We
became
friends
before
the
evening
ended
I
forgave
his
horse-laugh
also
professional
and
his
coarse
unpleasantry
but
the
attitude
of
his
wife
dis
gusted
me
She
was
no
longer
Madame
Bifsteck
only
the
slave
of
the
man
who
paid
her
lodging
She
nestled
to
him
provocatively
staring
at
me
No
use
The
spell
was
broken
All
s
unfair
in
love
or
war
but
her
unfairness
went
a
step
in
the
wrong
direction
Much
cheap
claret
was
consumed
The
cocher
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
I
preferred
the
spanking
to
the
odour
of
onions
and
bad
brandy
The
next
morning
I
missed
my
wallet
and
one
hundred
francs
I
didn
t
feel
particularly
well
and
this
loss
sent
my
heart
down
into
my
boots
I
raised
the
roof
I
threatened
to
call
in
the
police
Then
it
came
to
me
that
I
had
hidden
with
preposterous
caution
the
money
in
the
closet
where
I
found
it
I
apologised
in
customary
fashion
to
Bernard
and
over
our
cordials
he
told
me
that
the
coachman
had
suspected
his
partner
after
my
gift
of
the
stove
Beefsteaks
didn
t
count
It
was
the
riotous
extravagance
manifested
by
that
cheap
stove
transaction
I
was
advised
quietly
to
change
my
address
This
suited
me
The
city
was
warm
I
was
weary
of
Coralie
suddenly
and
the
next
day
I
was
en
route
for
the
country
Coralie
insisted
on
accompanying
me
to
the
Gare
du
Nord
holding
my
hand
and
at
times
when
P-paul
permitted
tenderly
pat
ting
my
head
She
had
the
limpid
luminous
eyes
of
the
born
liar
yet
she
was
simple
and
confiding
It
wasn
t
her
husband
that
worried
her
as
much
as
her
jealous
dog
Whenever
I
tried
to
kiss
her
he
snapped
at
my
nose
did
this
canine
guardian
of
the
household
honour
A
kill-joy
a
hateful
hound
he
barked
to
the
very
last
when
with
streaming
eyes
and
to
the
evident
appro
bation
of
railroad
porters
and
boys
we
kissed
our
fare
well
Dear
Coralie
Dear
Madame
Bifsteck
We
were
once
young
and
loving
Beefless
days
must
have
overtaken
you
Perhaps
you
married
your
drunken
coachman
Adieu
But
I
hope
that
infernal
P-paul
went
to
his
dogged
reward
THE
WHIRL
OF
THE
TOWN
Paris
is
a
beautiful
book
a
book
of
ivory
gold
and
irony
a
book
that
stirs
the
soul
as
it
stirs
the
senses
Paris
is
a
cloaca
the
lupanar
of
the
world
where
the
vilest
meets
the
vile
Paris
like
Rome
gives
you
pre
cisely
what
you
bring
to
it
I
have
never
had
patience
with
the
people
who
call
Paris
the
City
of
Pleasure
as
if
it
were
not
also
the
City
of
Work
Every
aggregation
of
humans
has
its
so-called
pleasures
painful
pleasures
for
the
most
part
Paris
is
simply
the
capital
of
the
civilised
world
and
must
pay
the
penalty
for
its
pre
eminence
It
is
the
modern
Scarlet
Woman
in
the
eyes
of
ignorant
prudes
and
Montmartre
is
one
of
the
Seven
Hills
of
vice
But
on
Montmartre
is
enthroned
the
Church
of
the
Sacred
Heart
God
s
hired
man
is
work
ing
without
wage
in
Paris
as
in
London
or
Pekin
In
France
were
synonymous
and
to
the
music
cynical
and
voluptuous
of
Offenbach
and
Johann
Strauss
the
world
enjoyed
itself
as
it
enjoyed
applauding
Renan
s
latest
book
or
Theresa
s
vulgarity
amused
by
Ponson
de
TerraiFs
fatuous
indecencies
while
speaking
in
the
same
breath
of
the
philosophical
anarch
Joseph
Proudhon
Bismarck
and
the
Prussians
seemed
far
away
Babel
or
Pompeii
The
tower
of
the
Second
Empire
reached
to
the
clouds
below
the
people
danced
on
the
edge
of
the
crumbling
crater
Jeremiah
walked
in
the
gardens
He
was
a
terrible
man
with
sombre
fatricidal
gaze
eyes
in
which
were
smothered
fires
of
hatred
His
thin
hair
waved
in
the
wind
He
said
to
his
friends
I
come
from
the
Tuileries
Palace
It
is
not
yet
consumed
The
Barbarians
delay
their
coming
What
is
Attila
doing
He
passed
A
madman
exclaimed
a
companion
to
Henri
Lasserre
He
is
Ernest
Hello
It
was
the
im
passioned
polemist
prophet
and
patriot
The
disquiet
ing
figure
is
evoked
of
that
son
of
Hanan
who
prowled
the
streets
of
the
Holy
City
in
the
year
62
A
D
crying
aloud
Woe
Woe
upon
Jerusalem
The
prophecy
of
Hello
was
realised
Attila
came
Attila
went
Seven
years
later
I
saw
his
handiwork
and
the
handiwork
of
the
Parisian
Bolsheviki
of
1871
the
Communists
and
those
hags
of
hell
the
petroleuses
The
Red
Virgin
Louise
Michel
was
still
living
and
in
the
faubourgs
memories
of
the
burning
and
sacking
of
the
city
were
green
and
memories
I
am
sorry
to
say
grateful
to
many
But
in
1878
there
were
compensations
for
the
sadly
afflicted
people
The
Exposition
was
a
rallying-point
It
was
the
first
public
expression
of
liberation
since
the
war
Paris
breathed
Paris
smiled
An
enchanted
city
for
me
Each
street
had
its
history
Fresh
from
the
Centennial
Exposition
I
could
make
comparisons
In
all
that
pertained
to
invention
to
machinery
to
the
arts
industrial
Philadelphia
led
but
in
the
gracious
arts
painting
sculpture
music
and
architecture
Paris
was
as
ever
peerless
I
loathe
this
word
it
sounds
like
a
baking-powder
advertisement
yet
I
can
think
of
none
better
Peerless
Paris
I
discovered
that
my
patri
otism
at
best
a
tender
plant
in
my
native
hothouse
had
suddenly
pushed
strong
sprouts
For
the
first
time
I
really
saw
our
flag
my
heart
beat
as
it
blew
from
the
Trocadero
The
American
Section
filled
me
with
pride
but
I
spent
most
of
my
time
in
the
art
Salons
In
Phila
delphia
we
had
raved
over
the
huge
panoramic
canvas
of
Hans
Markart
The
Triumph
of
Caterina
Cornaro
the
art
of
the
theatrical
scene-painter
In
the
Trocadero
were
assembled
all
that
was
exquisite
in
contemporary
art
And
at
the
Louvre
I
completed
my
education
be
gun
in
Black
and
White
with
colour
hitherto
sadly
neg
lected
Jules
Grevy
was
the
political
idol
of
the
day
His
face
was
to
be
seen
in
every
shop-window
Gambetta
shared
honours
with
him
I
remember
one
cartoon
entitled
The
End
of
a
Bad
Dream
depicting
Grevy
and
Gam
betta
clasping
hands
while
in
the
background
Marshal
MacMahon
and
others
are
seen
flying
away
Gambetta
one-eyed
as
Jewish-looking
as
a
rabbi
he
had
been
called
Jew
though
I
noticed
that
many
men
from
the
South
are
Jewish-looking
Alphonse
Daudet
for
exam
ple
whose
real
name
was
David
a
true
meridional
and
burly
and
bourgeois
I
saw
Victor
Hugo
who
had
ascended
the
final
ladder
of
glory
awaiting
only
the
apotheosis
of
death
which
came
a
few
years
later
I
saw
him
a
half
dozen
times
a
commonplace
old
gentleman
with
a
white
clipped
beard
and
the
inevitable
umbrella
of
the
prudent
Parisian
citizen
He
usually
rode
on
the
top
of
an
omni
bus
and
was
always
saluted
by
bared
heads
It
s
M
Hugo
great
poet
whispered
a
conductor
as
the
great
Frenchman
nimbly
mounted
to
the
imperiale
This
fighter
who
had
helped
with
his
mighty
pen
the
down
fall
of
that
stuffed-dummy
Emperor
and
bastard
Bona
parte
Napoleon
III
was
not
forgotten
by
his
country
men
His
eyes
alone
proclaimed
the
fire
of
genius
They
burnt
in
his
head
like
lamps
I
was
not
so
lucky
as
George
Moore
who
shook
hands
with
Turgenev
or
as
Henry
James
who
knew
the
lovable
Russian
novelist
but
I
once
saw
him
as
I
saw
Guy
de
Maupassant
at
the
Cafe
Sylvain
across
the
street
from
the
new
opera
house
Guy
was
as
burly
then
as
Gambetta
He
was
sipping
a
bock
A
more
uninteresting
young
man
you
couldn
t
encounter
in
a
day
s
walk
My
most
cherished
recol
lection
is
the
glimpse
I
had
of
Gustave
Flaubert
huge
a
veritable
Viking
with
the
long
drooping
mustache
of
a
trooper
and
big
blue
eyes
in
a
large
red
face
A
magnificent
man
He
was
hurrying
through
the
Rue
Saint-Lazare
possibly
on
his
way
to
the
gare
and
Rouen
My
old
friend
M
Grandjean
pointed
him
out
but
while
I
had
read
Madame
Bovary
the
sight
of
Paul
de
Cassag
nac
swaggering
behind
Flaubert
arrested
my
attention
The
duellist
and
notorious
politician
was
surrounded
by
a
flock
of
sycophants
who
owned
the
sidewalk
Soli
tary
his
brain
filled
with
dreams
Flaubert
went
his
way
The
reigning
painters
in
1878
were
Meissonier
Carolus
Duran
Bouguereau
Jules
Lefebvre
Cabanel
whose
Venus
painted
with
a
brush
dipped
in
soft
soap
may
be
seen
smiling
on
a
couch
of
sea-foam
at
the
Philadelphia
Academy
of
the
Fine
Arts
here
Leon
Bonnat
Paul
Baudry
Laurens
Delaunay
Henner
Gerome
and
Henri
Regnault
all
men
of
the
Institute
though
the
unhappy
Regnault
his
life
lost
through
a
spent
bullet
during
the
last
days
of
the
war
at
Buzenval
was
considered
a
violent
rebel
However
his
Moorish
Execution
and
his
Salome
reveal
him
as
a
conventional
Orientalist
But
the
others
they
ruled
artistic
Paris
Edouard
Manet
Claude
Monet
and
a
few
brave
men
had
exhibited
at
the
Salon
des
Refuses
in
1867
an
invention
of
the
Emperor
who
stunned
by
the
clamour
instituted
this
gallery
of
there
had
been
another
show
that
had
scandalised
Paris
Manet
deliberately
defied
criticism
with
an
exhibition
of
his
own
canvases
for
which
he
wrote
a
catalogue
and
a
challenge
Whistler
later
imitated
him
Official
art
frowned
Traces
of
this
frown
I
found
when
I
visited
Julian
s
school
or
the
ateliers
of
Gerome
and
Bonnat
The
way
I
found
myself
in
the
very
thick
of
art
student
life
was
through
the
good
graces
of
Milne
Ramsey
a
young
Philadelphia
painter
in
the
atelier
I
think
of
Bonnat
He
had
married
Miss
Ruff
a
daughter
of
my
father
s
old
friend
General
Ruff
and
it
was
at
his
hos
pitable
studio
that
I
met
some
of
the
young
artistic
Americans
in
Paris
Edwin
Blashfield
W
H
Lippincott
Charles
Sprague
Pearce
Herman
Hynemann
Henry
Thouron
Van
der
Kempf
a
sculptor
Thomas
Healy
who
at
Rome
had
painted
Liszt
Frank
Moss
Loomis
and
Helen
Courson
who
painted
animals
Not
Manet
but
Bonnat
was
my
man
and
with
Gerome
seemed
to
be
the
acme
of
vital
progressive
art
The
portrait
of
Thiers
is
a
solid
work
after
all
beside
which
the
febrile
hasty
abridged
statements
in
the
Manet
portraiture
appeared
thin
and
shallow
Yes
I
confess
it
without
a
mea-culpa
that
the
Impressionists
repulsed
me
by
their
glaring
striped
brush
work
ugly
subjects
I
fancy
that
it
was
there
the
shoe
pinched
my
eye
having
been
fed
with
the
beauties
of
the
Italian
schools
and
their
boastfulness
Manet
in
particular
was
an
object
of
curiosity
His
colour
appealed
but
his
faulty
technique
after
the
neatly
finished
surfaces
of
Meissonier
or
the
creamy
nudities
of
Lefebvre
I
see
it
all
now
The
official
painting
of
that
time
was
not
so
bad
as
the
new
crowd
pretended
it
to
be
Other
days
other
palettes
Bonnat
was
not
a
genius
and
Gerome
should
have
begun
with
model
ling
instead
of
ending
his
career
chisel
in
hand
His
talent
was
more
sculptural
than
pictorial
Nevertheless
there
was
plenty
of
power
felicity
of
ex
pression
and
genuine
craftsmanship
in
this
much
abused
group
After
thirty
years
and
after
revisiting
the
Louvre
or
the
Luxembourg
I
find
the
Impressionists
as
old
fashioned
as
the
Fontainebleau
group
yes
even
the
Pont-Aven
School
headed
by
Gauguin
and
Van
Gogh
is
dating
The
truth
is
that
the
time
factor
is
grossly
overestimated
Good
art
in
1500
or
1830
or
1867
or
particularly
his
much-neglected
figure
pieces
The
natu
ralistic
movement
had
for
its
true
father
Gustave
Cour
bet
a
romantic
canvas
is
his
Funeral
at
Ornans
ro
mantic
and
black
as
a
Muncaczy
Monet
was
the
first
Impressionist
Nietzsche
said
the
first
Christian
and
only
Christian
died
on
the
Cross
Claude
Monet
was
the
original
Impressionist
notwithstanding
his
debt
to
Turner
and
Watteau
the
Watteau
of
the
Embarkment
for
Cythera
in
the
Louvre
The
rest
patterned
after
this
individual
painter
whose
myopia
made
him
see
his
landscapes
blurred
Manet
much
influenced
by
Velas
quez
and
Goya
followed
Monet
while
Edgar
Degas
strictly
speaking
did
not
belong
to
this
group
which
had
been
given
the
unhappy
title
of
the
BatignoIIes
School
Atmosphere
was
the
valuable
contribution
of
the
Im
pressionists
to
art
I
didn
t
know
enough
forty
years
ago
to
feel
the
current
of
fresh
air
that
swept
through
Parisian
ateliers
And
the
gorgeous
hues
of
the
new
painters
What
courage
they
had
and
how
they
were
jeered
at
I
remember
going
to
a
minor
show
by
major
artists
on
the
Boulevard
Clichy
somewhere
in
company
with
William
Lippincott
and
Pearce
What
fun
we
had
with
the
comical
smears
of
Pissarro
Renoir
Mon
Dieu
think
of
it
Renoir
a
painter
of
genius
Sisley
the
most
exquisite
of
them
all
and
Monet
I
blush
as
I
write
this
I
liked
Boudin
one
of
Monet
s
earlier
masters
yet
couldn
t
trace
the
logical
development
of
his
pupil
It
was
not
till
the
spring
of
1885
an
at
tne
exhibition
held
in
the
Durand-Ruel
Galleries
then
on
Fifth
Avenue
at
Thirty
sixth
Street
that
a
great
light
broke
in
upon
me
No
doubt
my
eyes
had
been
unconsciously
trained
by
the
first
pictures
seen
in
Paris
Now
the
Caillebotte
gallery
in
the
Luxembourg
seems
antiquated
The
men
of
1830
too
are
for
the
most
part
stale
Theodore
Rousseau
the
biggest
of
the
group
is
blackening
Jules
Dupre
is
greasy
in
colour
and
sloppy
in
sentiment
Diaz
is
sen
suous
in
colour
Monticelli
in
his
best
estate
is
richer
while
Daubigny
despite
the
high
prices
he
fetches
is
often
obvious
Corot
has
lasted
The
followers
Har
pignies
Breton
Jacque
and
the
rest
need
not
concern
us
Painting
has
its
fashions
and
fluctuations
I
am
chiefly
concerned
with
the
fact
that
Meissonier
seemed
then
a
more
finished
painter
than
Manet
perhaps
he
was
so
finished
that
he
was
lifeless
his
metallic
style
crushing
the
vitality
of
his
figures
Manet
gave
his
generation
a
new
opera-glass
with
which
to
view
the
pass
ing
show
He
was
the
great
colourist
of
his
epoch
though
not
so
big
a
personality
or
temperament
as
either
Dela
croix
or
Courbet
I
fear
that
I
have
always
been
a
re
actionary
witness
my
present
admiration
for
such
dear
old-fashioned
classics
as
Stendhal
Ibsen
Strindberg
Karl
Marx
Nietzsche
Max
Stirner
and
George
Shaw
Archaic
Yes
Noaharchaic
Carolus-Duran
made
a
deep
impression
on
me
with
his
velvet
jacket
lace
collars
and
cuffs
dark
handsome
head
and
eyes
sparkling
with
diabolic
verve
He
looked
as
he
painted
a
much
more
unusual
combination
than
is
believed
brilliant
and
attractive
I
know
now
that
he
plays
second
fiddle
to
Alfred
Stevens
of
Brussels
in
quality
and
design
but
he
did
knock
us
out
with
his
virtuosity
which
his
pupil
John
Singer
Sargent
inherited
Gandara
among
living
painters
has
the
same
clever
knack
the
drawing-room
touch
never
great
art
Gerome
was
a
severe
man
chary
of
speech
interested
in
paint
problems
Bonnat
I
liked
hail
fellow
well
met
yet
always
the
dignified
master
a
rather
difficult
pose
to
maintain
Thomas
Couture
I
saw
in
his
home
at
Villiers
le-Bel
on
the
road
to
Ecouen
The
admired
painter
of
The
Romans
of
the
Decadence
with
its
baccha
nalian
attitudes
its
official
scheme
of
composition
and
hot
colouring
was
then
failing
in
health
He
had
outlived
his
reputation
An
amiable
invalid
happy
with
his
wife
and
daughters
in
his
villa
and
generous
gardens
he
told
me
some
things
of
his
contemporaries
He
despised
Manet
a
painter
without
talent
vain
of
his
missing
tail
like
the
fox
in
the
fable
Couture
painted
some
pretty
pictures
notably
the
boy
blowing
soap
bubbles
hanging
in
the
Metropolitan
Museum
New
York
but
he
was
obsessed
by
the
grand
manner
He
longed
to
be
a
second
J
L
David
And
he
was
not
He
died
shortly
after
in
1879
My
passion
for
the
land
scapes
of
Claude
Lorraine
and
J
B
Poussin
was
justified
by
the
architectural
design
of
Poussin
and
the
tender
ness
of
tone
still
surviving
in
Claude
They
are
masters
despite
the
newcomers
BOHEMIA
S
SEA-COAST
I
went
often
to
the
Cafe
Guerbois
on
the
exterior
boulevard
where
I
saw
Manet
Degas
Desboutins
but
not
Monet
My
acquaintance
with
the
visionary
Villiers
de
Flsle
Adam
began
at
this
cafe
Writer
of
prose
tales
an
improvisor
at
the
keyboard
as
well
as
before
a
table
he
fascinated
me
I
have
written
of
him
at
length
in
the
first
chapter
of
The
Pathos
of
Distance
called
The
Magic
Lantern
and
critically
considered
him
in
Icono
clasts
Villiers
was
a
fabulous
creature
Dream
and
reality
were
so
closely
woven
in
his
consciousness
that
he
never
seemed
quite
awake
or
sleeping
Whether
he
drugged
or
not
I
can
t
say
but
he
was
the
greatest
liar
I
ever
met
and
I
have
met
many
being
a
newspaper
man
Only
Villiers
was
an
artistic
liar
He
told
im
probable
stories
always
figuring
as
the
hero
that
would
have
made
Baron
Miinchausen
blush
His
magic
lan
tern
for
instance
which
I
recorded
is
one
of
his
splendid
inventions
He
was
an
accomplished
monologuist
and
needed
but
a
vinegar-cruet
as
an
audience
his
fellow
man
failing
but
fellow-man
seldom
failed
When
Villiers
had
money
he
paid
for
the
entertainment
and
if
poor
which
was
the
rule
he
still
paid
for
others
food
and
drink
by
improvising
stories
which
were
promptly
gobbled
up
by
his
good
friends
who
lost
no
time
in
pawn
ing
the
stolen
goods
at
the
nearest
newspaper
office
He
was
a
gold-mine
this
marvellous
magician
Villiers
de
I
lsle
Adam
But
Joris-Karel
Huysmans
and
a
few
intimate
friends
had
to
look
after
his
funeral
expenses
Perhaps
there
are
a
few
Americans
who
remember
his
tale
The
Torture
by
Hope
as
Poesque
as
The
Pit
and
the
Pendulum
He
loved
Poe
and
wrote
a
novel
with
Thomas
A
Edison
as
hero
The
Eve
of
the
Future
it
is
called
and
is
the
grotesque
story
of
an
artificial
woman
made
of
steel
springs
who
loves
a
man
Perhaps
if
he
had
heard
an
Edison
phonograph
with
all
its
horrors
he
might
not
have
put
the
inventor
in
a
book
for
he
was
a
fanatical
lover
of
music
and
an
intimate
friend
of
Richard
Wagner
He
it
was
who
told
me
of
Manet
s
famous
witticisms
Manet
before
a
picture
of
Meis
sonier
The
Charge
of
the
Cuirassiers
Good
very
good
exclaimed
the
painter
of
Olympia
not
then
in
the
Louvre
All
is
steel
except
the
breastplates
Meissonier
was
furious
when
a
kind
friend
carried
the
mot
to
him
Alfred
Stevens
had
said
that
Manet
drank
the
beer
of
Haarlem
after
seeing
his
Le
Bon
Bock
which
is
unmistakably
derived
from
Frans
Hals
and
Manet
waited
for
his
revenge
and
got
it
when
he
saw
a
picture
by
Stevens
portraying
a
fashionable
young
woman
in
street
dress
standing
before
a
portiere
which
she
is
about
to
push
aside
to
enter
the
next
room
Manet
noted
an
elaborately
painted
feather
duster
Stevens
was
a
master
of
still-life
which
lies
on
the
floor
at
the
feet
of
the
lady
Ha
he
ejaculated
she
has
a
rendezvous
with
the
valet-de-chambre
Villiers
wrote
a
five-act
play
entitled
The
New
World
for
which
he
won
a
prize
of
ten
thousand
francs
and
a
medal
of
honour
The
prize
was
offered
to
the
French
dramatic
author
who
would
most
powerfully
recall
in
a
work
of
four
or
five
acts
the
episode
of
the
proclamation
of
the
Independence
of
the
United
States
the
hundredth
anniversary
of
which
fell
on
July
4
1876
It
was
hissed
at
its
production
in
1883
There
were
only
six
presenta
tions
at
the
Theatre
des
Nations
It
is
unreadable
a
second
time
The
poet
was
not
a
playwright
He
was
of
noble
family
an
ardent
Roman
Catholic
and
a
Dia
bolist
one
of
those
Catholics
like
his
friends
Barbey
d
Aurevilly
and
Paul
Verlaine
of
whom
their
coreligion
ists
were
not
precisely
proud
despite
the
devotion
ex
pressed
in
their
writings
to
the
church
One
of
the
witty
epigrams
of
Villiers
is
worthy
of
Voltaire
After
a
character
of
his
Bonhomet
goes
to
heaven
the
Almighty
greets
him
Well
Bonhomet
when
do
you
propose
to
drop
the
mask
After
you
Seigneur
responds
the
cynical
Triboulet
slayer
of
swans
at
midnight
and
pro
fessional
idealist
at
large
I
have
spoken
of
Franz
Liszt
and
the
almost
irresistible
influence
his
legend
had
upon
my
youthful
imagination
He
was
like
the
mountain
in
the
Arabian
Nights
all
the
ships
with
their
little
musical
Sinbads
were
dragged
out
of
their
course
and
ended
by
clinging
to
him
as
does
iron
to
a
magnet
I
had
no
plan
only
to
meet
him
hear
him
play
I
have
elsewhere
related
of
pursuing
an
old
man
with
white
hair
groggy
nose
and
warts
in
abundance
it
was
on
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
He
was
sitting
in
a
fiacre
I
chased
it
for
the
length
of
that
very
long
street
Was
it
Liszt
I
couldn
t
take
my
affidavit
that
it
was
There
were
many
old
w
r
hite-haired
men
in
Paris
also
groggy
noses
Liszt
was
a
celebrated
cognac
absorber
and
wearing
warts
all
over
their
faces
I
haunted
the
Exposition
especially
the
Austro-Hungarian
section
I
never
saw
him
but
one
evening
in
the
concert
hall
I
heard
Nicolas
Rubinstein
play
the
first
Tschaikovsky
piano
concerto
the
very
composition
he
had
derided
under
the
nose
of
Peter
Illitsch
a
few
years
previous
at
Moscow
It
was
not
a
novelty
for
me
as
I
had
heard
von
Billow
play
it
in
the
Academy
of
Music
Philadelphia
either
in
the
autumn
of
1875
or
early
in
1876
B
J
Lang
of
Boston
conducted
the
orchestra
and
things
were
soon
at
sixes
and
sevens
the
solo
performer
was
white
with
rage
The
playing
of
Nicolas
the
brother
of
the
mighty
Anton
did
not
stir
me
but
it
was
of
crystal
line
purity
and
impeccable
as
to
technique
His
style
was
more
finished
than
Anton
s
But
the
passion
and
that
nameless
something
we
feel
rather
than
call
genius
he
did
not
possess
Poor
Tschaikovsky
who
had
been
abused
by
both
brothers
for
the
workmanship
of
this
B
flat
minor
concerto
would
have
smiled
if
he
had
heard
the
interpretation
of
Nicolas
Rafael
Joseffy
was
at
this
time
associated
with
Tschaikovsky
in
the
Moscow
conservatory
of
which
Nicolas
Rubinstein
was
director
He
it
was
who
first
told
me
of
the
mysterious
taking-off
of
Nicolas
who
did
not
die
from
too
much
wine-drinking
but
was
murdered
by
a
jealous
husband
and
with
a
sand
club
in
the
same
manner
as
L
M
Gottschalk
in
South
America
The
piano
virtuoso
Emil
Sauer
a
pupil
of
Nicolas
hints
at
the
occurrence
in
his
autobi
ography
My
Life
but
Joseffy
gave
me
the
details
Struck
in
the
milt
by
a
sand
club
which
leaves
hardly
a
perceptible
bruise
the
unlucky
pianist
agonised
for
weeks
he
even
was
transported
to
Paris
but
he
failed
to
get
relief
and
died
stupefied
by
morphine
There
are
many
matters
that
never
get
into
the
newspapers
Tschaikovsky
s
death
was
another
Cholera
or
suicide
I
was
refused
at
the
Paris
Conservatoire
de
la
Musique
then
in
its
old
quarters
Rue
du
Faubourg
Poissoniere
Ambroise
Thomas
was
musical
director
a
soured
man
whose
Mignon
remained
his
one
success
Hamlet
even
with
Lassalle
singing
the
title-role
was
a
joke
Shake
spearean
and
otherwise
My
examination
was
set
down
for
November
13
and
I
had
been
prepared
for
its
rigours
by
going
to
church
daily
for
a
week
Old
man
Lefevre

that
But
if
as
Napoleon
said
God
is
on
the
side
of
the
heaviest
battalions
he
must
have
sided
on
that
par
ticular
day
with
the
greatest
technique
I
didn
t
have
a
show
I
was
too
frightened
to
play
a
scale
evenly
My
entrance
on
the
stage
before
the
jury
was
greeted
by
an
exclamation
from
Madame
Massart
nee
Masson
Quelle
barbe
alluding
to
the
blond
fleece
on
my
sawney
chin
I
had
a
sweet
fluffy
beard

Oh

Once
I
at
tracted
the
attention
of
a
distinguished
visitor
in
Paris
though
no
stranger
there
Albert
Prince
of
Wales
He
stood
in
a
jeweller
s
shop
on
the
grand
boulevard
exam
ining
something
sparkling
It
was
near
the
door
I
stared
in
No
doubt
I
looked
like
a
hungry
person
I
wasn
t
but
the
Prince
didn
t
know
it
and
putting
1
a
spray
of
diamonds
in
a
case
into
his
coat
pocket
he
came
out
of
the
place
broadly
smiling
at
me
and
his
sole
com
panion
a
handsome
young
chap
joined
in
I
did
too
Later
at
Marienbad
in
1903
I
saw
the
same
equerry
of
King
Edward
the
Hon
Captain
Ponsonby
But
the
Conservatoire
To
tell
the
truth
I
am
tired
of
retelling
that
old
tale
Suffice
to
say
that
with
all
my
pull
I
was
turned
down
I
had
asked
Lucy
Hamilton
Hooper
to
get
me
a
letter
from
General
Fairchild
who
was
either
the
American
Minister
or
Consul
General
I
ve
for
gotten
which
Mrs
Hooper
had
been
Paris
correspon
dent
of
the
Philadelphia
Evening
Bulletin
and
was
the
wife
of
Robert
Hooper
of
our
consulate
This
letter
so
graciously
given
me
was
presented
and
did
something
for
it
got
me
admission
to
the
piano
class
of
Georges
Mathias
a
pupil
of
Chopin
not
indeed
to
play
but
to
listen
a
very
important
act
in
the
study
of
music
I
became
auditeur
for
a
short
period
and
also
had
the
advice
in
private
of
M
Mathias
a
charming
old
gentle
man
who
told
me
more
about
the
personality
of
Chopin
than
all
the
books
on
the
subject
Chopin
was
a
human
being
after
all
and
neither
an
angel
of
light
nor
a
demon
of
darkness
Like
many
another
man
of
genius
or
business
he
was
very
irritable
His
tuberculosis
and
neurasthenia
made
him
impatient
poor
suffering
man
The
Sand
affair
was
over
when
Mathias
had
studied
Chopin
did
not
die
from
the
parting
with
Sand
but
from
the
liaison
itself
Sand
never
spared
youth
Yet
she
too
must
have
had
tempestuous
times
Her
invalid
had
his
daily
tantrums
She
loved
her
liberty
He
didn
t
like
the
idea
that
she
entertained
men
even
at
her
home
also
his
during
his
absence
That
was
the
chief
cause
of
the
rupture
with
Liszt
I
hinted
at
it
in
my
book
on
Chopin
The
worst
side
of
the
brief
adventure
was
that
Sand
piloted
Liszt
to
Chopin
s
own
apartment
who
on
his
return
found
the
place
in
dis
order
He
never
forgave
either
Liszt
or
Sand
It
was
an
ignoble
episode
To
my
surprise
I
learned
that
Frederic
was
fickle
He
had
a
new
affair
every
day
His
parting
from
George
was
partly
brought
about
by
indifference
on
her
side
and
wholly
through
the
devilish
intriguing
of
her
sweet
daughter
Solange
who
made
open
love
to
Frederic
so
as
to
give
her
mother
pain
Most
writers
balk
at
this
too
Gallic
situation
to
be
found
in
novels
and
in
Maurice
Donnay
s
play
L
Autre
Danger
But
Madame
Waldemar
Karenine
Sand
s
Russian
biographer
does
not
The
combination
of
con
sumption
and
George
Sand
would
have
killed
Casanova
It
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
seamy
side
of
Paris
interested
me
I
never
worked
under
such
a
forced
emotional
draught
as
in
those
few
years
I
felt
that
my
parents
might
send
for
me
at
any
moment
and
I
didn
t
waste
time
I
had
set
high
standards
for
my
self
It
was
to
be
a
crucifixion
on
the
cross
of
art
Goethe
s
advice
which
I
had
read
in
Carlyle
to
live
in
the
good
the
true
and
the
beautiful
did
not
seem
too
difficult
Walter
Pater
who
owes
more
to
the
sage
of
Weimar
than
is
generally
supposed
had
assured
us
that
success
in
life
was
to
burn
always
with
this
hard
gem
like
flame
to
maintain
this
ecstasy
a
counsel
of
perfec
tion
but
one
that
might
also
lead
to
a
mad-house
Failure
is
to
form
habits
not
the
fruit
of
experi
ence
but
experience
itself
is
the
end
Well
I
failed
to
form
habits
yet
I
am
no
nearer
success
hedonistic
or
worldly
And
William
Blake
with
his
suggestion
that
the
road
to
wisdom
is
through
the
valley
of
excess
did
not
work
wonders
with
me
Havelock
Ellis
points
out
that
spiritual
excess
is
meant
by
the
great
English
poet
mystic
and
designer
Perhaps
In
either
case
head
aches
moral
and
physical
are
bound
to
follow
I
was
aflame
with
enthusiasm
that
like
stubble
burnt
out
in
a
trice
I
never
climbed
so
many
perilous
steeples
as
in
Paris
I
wished
to
be
shown
all
the
splendours
of
earthly
wisdom
I
longed
for
the
glory
that
was
Liszt
s
and
the
grandeur
that
was
Rubinstein
s
After
eating

taurant
fat
as
Robert
Louis
Stevenson
says
and
R
L

was
at
Grez
near
Fontainebleau
in
1879
I
had
rather
have
met
that
uncanny
Scotch
youth
or
George
Moore
than
Flaubert
or
Turgenev
But
fate
willed
otherwise
I
was
a
regular
frequenter
of
the
Pasdeloup
Sunday
afternoon
concerts
in
the
Cirque
d
HJver
also
of
the
Cha
telet
concerts
Jacques
Pasdeloup
conducted
the
Winter
Circus
affairs
His
real
name
was
said
to
be
Jacob
Wolfgang
But
he
was
Parisian
born
he
wore
whisk
ers
and
waved
a
wand
that
is
all
I
recall
of
his
person
ality
Colonne
and
Lamoureux
drove
him
out
of
the
concert
field
a
few
years
after
I
heard
him
As
an
or
chestra
the
Pasdeloup
could
never
compete
with
the
band
at
the
Conservatoire
technically
the
most
polished
in
Paris
I
listened
to
much
new
music
at
the
Sunday
popular
concerts
amongst
the
rest
Rimsky-KorsakofPs
symphonic
legend
Sadko
And
heartily
hissed
it
was
A
minority
in
the
audience
to
be
exact
the
students
in
the
top
gallery
applauded
and
fisticuffs
ensued
I
usually
left
the
Boulevard
des
BatignoIIes
after
my
mid
day
breakfast
traversing
the
Quartier
de
P
Europe
till
I
reached
the
Rue
de
Rome
down
the
slope
of
which
I
swiftly
descended
to
the
Gare
St
Lazare
where
I
switched
through
the
Rue
St
Lazare
to
the
grand
boulevard
via
the
Rue
de
la
Chausee
d
Antin
and
down
the
boulevard
to
the
Cirque
d
Hiver
a
long
walk
there
and
back
even
for
my
young
legs
Invariably
there
was
a
battle
to
reach
the
gallery
fifteen
cents
admission
and
secure
front-row
seats
Once
on
the
Rue
de
Rome
I
saw
the
blond-bearded
Manet
with
Stephane
Mallarme
both
lived
in
the
European
quarter
in
fact
the
Latin
quarter
was
not
so
popular
with
painters
or
writers
then
as
the
more
commodious
better-lighted
studios
along
the
boule
vards
des
BatignoJIes
or
Clichy
really
the
same
broad
street
The
last
time
I
was
in
Paris
1914
I
walked
up
the
steep
Rue
de
Rome
and
visited
my
old
home
on
the
Rue
de
Puteaux
expecting
to
find
another
building
But
there
it
stood
shabby
like
the
entire
block
while
across
the
narrow
street
was
the
yellow
wall
enclosing
the
forlorn
garden
with
the
same
dusty
trees
I
asked
the
lady
of
the
house
the
concierge
if
she
remembered
Papa
Bernard
I
risked
the
question
because
she
was
over
eighty
and
evidently
an
old
inhabitant
of
the
quarter
Miraculously
she
remembered
him
She
had
been
in
his
service
before
my
time
and
later
lived
in
the
same
street
He
had
remained
at
No
5
for
a
few
years
then
he
had
moved
up
the
Boulevard
Clichy
After
that
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
And
his
wife
the
estimable
sage
femme
ah
that
predacious
beak
of
hers
and
her
prowling
ways
Monsieur
responded
the
brave
woman
he
had
so
many
wives
Feeling
as
if
I
had
peeped
into
a
dark
dirty
old
well
I
tipped
her
and
resumed
my
excursion
down
the
boule
vard
Even
that
deformed
dwarf
had
his
compensations
At
the
Comedie
Frangaise
I
saw
a
revival
of
Ruy
Bias
L
Assomoir
was
dramatised
and
produced
early
in
the
drunken
roofer
and
husband
of
Gervaise
actually
died
in
delirium
tremens
He
had
become
abnormally
thirsty
playing
the
role
of
a
drunkard
The
winner
of
the
grand
prize

named
Aubriot
Clotilde
Kleeberg
s
piano
play
ing
charmed
me
She
was
a
cousin
of
the
painter
Her
man
Hynemann
of
Philadelphia
I
met
her
again
at
Baireuth
in
1896
She
remembered
her
debut
at
the
Pasdeloup
concert
I
heard
Miolan-Carvalho
at
the
grand
opera
also
the
tenor
Talazac
Camilla
Sivori
one
of
the
rare
pupils
of
Paganini
played
at
the
Pas
deloup
matinee
He
was
very
old
and
his
tone
was
small
but
he
was
an
artist
He
had
appeared
in
Phila
delphia
as
had
Henri
Vieuxtemps
and
while
the
mem
ory
of
the
Belgian
master
is
vivid
I
can
t
clearly
recall
Sivori
there
The
original
Carmen
Galli-Marie
I
heard
but
not
in
the
Bizet
opera
I
don
t
think
the
work
was
given
at
the
Opera
Comique
while
I
was
in
Paris
It
was
not
the
enormous
failure
generally
supposed
Philip
Hale
has
dispelled
that
myth
nor
did
Georges
Bizet
die
of
a
broken
heart
over
the
supposed
fiasco
Like
Alfred
de
Musset
he
died
from
too
much
absinthe
Zola
I
saw
and
Daudet
There
was
no
thought
of
Paul
Cezanne
in
those
days
but
Barbey
d
Aurevilly
still
promenaded
lace
cuffs
clouded
cane
corseted
and
hair
flowing
like
the
mane
of
a
Barbary
mare
I
never
saw
a
Barbary
mare
but
suppose
the
animal
has
a
mane
Anna
Bock
was
another
debutante
in
1879
She
came
from
New
York
and
had
studied
with
Liszt
I
heard
her
at
the
Salle
Pleyel
where
in
company
with
Leonard
she
played
Beethoven
s
Kreutzer
Sonata
for
piano
and
violin
also
some
Chopin
Frederic
Boscovitz
another
Liszt
pupil
a
Hungarian
and
cousin
of
Joseffy
gave
several
concerts
at
the
Salle
Erard
He
was
familiar
to
me
as
I
had
attended
his
daily
recital
at
the
Centennial
Exposition
where
he
had
charge
of
the
Steinway
section
The
Marie
Tayau
string
quartet
numbered
among
its
members
an
American
girl
from
New
Orleans
Jeanne
Franko
the
sister
of
the
conductors
and
violinists
Nahan
and
Sam
Franko
She
is
still
playing
in
New
York
Marie
Tayau
was
a
violin
talent
Miss
Franko
took
the
second
violin
in
the
quartet
Louis
Diemer
played
the
E
minor
Chopin
piano
concerto
I
didn
t
admire
it
It
was
like
most
French
Chopin
interpreta
tions
precise
and
chilly
Only
Slavs
play
Chopin
to
perfection
Think
of
listening
to
Berlioz
his
Romeo
et
Juliette
at
a
concert
du
Chatelet
Colonne
con
ducted
At
the
opera
the
director
was
Halanzier
During
one
week
I
heard
Der
Freischutz
a
ballet
Yeddo
Faust
and
Robert
le
Diable
Catho
licity
in
taste
Fatiniza
was
also
produced
I
chiefly
remember
it
with
Jeannie
Winston
at
the
old
Chestnut
Street
Theatre
Philadelphia
Honore
Daumier
died
in
1879
at
tne
advanced
age
of
seventy-seven
He
must
have
been
pickled
in
alcohol
but
unlike
Monticelli
that
evoker
of
gorgeous
land
scapes
the
great
caricaturist
still
greater
painter
did
not
touch
absinthe
He
loved
brandy
It
didn
t
hurt
his
art
nor
did
absinthe
hurt
the
art
of
Ziem
who
lived
to
be
ninety
but
the
poison
killed
Monticelli
It
was
sim
ply
a
survival
of
the
fittest
tank
Daumier
s
modesty
was
proverbial
He
was
a
close
friend
of
Corot
and
Daubigny
One
day
Daubigny
introduced
him
to
a
rich
American
picture
dealer
are
there
any
poor
ones
and
warned
him
not
to
ask
less
than
5,000
francs
for
the
first
picture
This
he
did
The
American
paid
the
price
then
begged
for
more
Daumier
showed
him
another
canvas
How
much
The
artist
was
perplexed
Dau
bigny
had
said
nothing
about
a
second
picture
Em
barrassed
he
replied
500
francs
Don
t
want
it
said
the
other
I
don
t
like
it
as
well
as
the
first
be
sides
I
never
sell
any
but
dear
pictures
Daumier
delighted
in
repeating
this
rather
doubtful
story
But
a
witticism
of
his
was
afterwards
appropriated
by
Jemmy
Whistler
Emboldened
by
his
encounter
with
the
Ameri
francs
for
a
beautiful
picture
The
man
looked
around
the
shabby
atelier
and
then
at
the
artist
as
if
he
had
been
an
escaped
lunatic
What
Monsieur
for
that
little
canvas
50,000
francs
My
posthumous
price
Mon
sieur
proudly
responded
Daumier
The
picture
was
one
of
his
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
Panza
compositions
and
its
posthumous
price
was
double
what
the
painter
had
asked
for
it
One
afternoon
as
I
was
leaving
my
palace
in
the
BatignoIIes
an
open
carriage
drove
to
the
door
and
out
jumped
my
old
friend
the
scarecrow
of
the
steerage
on
the
steamship
Canada
He
really
had
a
rich
uncle
living
on
the
Rue
de
Provence
and
had
learned
my
ad
dress
at
Drexel
s
He
carried
a
large
bouquet
which
he
effusively
offered
to
me
as
if
I
were
a
prima
donna
Naturally
I
was
embarrassed
but
the
concierge
was
impressed
The
young
man
was
again
on
Easy
Street
and
no
doubt
had
wheedled
his
banker
relative
into
a
grand
generosity
What
could
I
do
but
accompany
him
breakfast
with
him
at
Les
Trois
Freres
Proven
aux
still
on
the
boulevard
and
take
a
ride
to
Auteuil
There
were
other
items
too
but
I
ve
forgotten
them
suffice
to
add
that
I
never
saw
him
again
my
friend
with
the
rhetorical
rags
He
had
called
merely
to
dazzle
me
and
he
did
At
a
benefit
for
the
yellow
fever
sufferers
in
New
Or
leans
September
1878
I
heard
Camille
Saint-Saens
at
the
piano
for
the
first
time
In
company
with
his
pupil
Madame
Montigny-Remaury
he
played
his
own
arrange
ment
of
the
trio
from
Beethoven
s
E
flat
Sonata
opus
31
No
3
for
two
pianos
He
also
gave
with
finesse
his
G
minor
concerto
for
piano
and
orchestra
Josefiy
alone
outshone
him
in
the
scherzo
In
this
hall
of
the
Troca
dero
and
in
1896
I
heard
Harold
Bauer
play
the
work
And
in
that
same
season
I
went
to
a
concert
in
the
Salle
Erard
which
celebrated
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
first
public
appearance
of
the
composer
who
refuses
to
become
venerable
even
in
1919
He
played
in
public
there
in
1846
I
have
listened
to
much
of
his
or
chestral
music
in
Paris
too
much
for
his
range
is
lim
ited
though
his
resourcefulness
is
remarkable
With
the
years
his
playing
has
become
dry
in
1878
it
was
scintillating
A
piano
touch
like
a
voice
loses
its
fresh
ness
its
tactile
sensibility
Von
Billow
was
always
dry
but
his
intellectual
power
dominated
his
audience
Saint-Saens
a
protege
of
Liszt
wrote
interesting
music
significant
though
not
original
music
He
is
an
eclectic
His
Deluge
at
the
Pasdeloup
proved
a
deluge
of
notes
without
a
Mt
Ararat
of
a
melody
to
perch
upon
His
opera
Etienne
Marcel
produced
at
Lyons
met
with
fair
success
Patti
and
Nicolini
were
at
Nice
Nicolas
her
second
husband
better
known
by
his
stage
name
Nicolini
won
favour
in
America
I
heard
them
in
Ai
da
Aunt
Adelina
wasn
t
Ai
da
for
a
moment
but
how
she
warbled
in
the
Nile
scene
Her
trusty
com
panion
Mile
Bauermeister
not
Mathilde
of
Metro
politan
Opera
House
memory
wasn
t
an
admirer
of
Nicolini
Too
many
husbands
spoiled
the
vocal
broth
she
grumbled
One
night
when
the
tenor
was
on
the
scene
Patti
asked
the
faithful
Bauermeister
his
where
abouts
He
is
out
there
whimpering
before
the
foot
lights
she
grimly
replied
Not
such
an
unfair
criticism
as
Nicolini
did
indulge
in
the
voix
larmoyante
so
beloved
of
Italian
tenors
Fancy
my
hearing
Alfred
Jaell
the
fat
pianist
who
gave
up
playing
because
his
arms
could
no
longer
reach
the
keyboard
when
his
stomach
became
a
balloon
He
played
with
neatness
and
musically
His
wife
Marie
Jaell
composed
Her
piano
playing
was
broader
than
her
husband
s
waist
withal
lacking
in
unction
Colonne
conducted
the
Damnation
of
Berlioz
as
well
as
of
Faust
and
I
wondered
why
people
went
to
hear
Miolan-Carvalho
as
Marguerite
Gabrielle
Krauss
was
more
impressive
There
was
a
composer
in
vogue
named
Leon
Vasseur
La
Timbale
d
Argent
made
Offenbach
sit
up
but
Le
Droit
du
Seigneur
did
not

the

was
naughty
and
mediaeval
setting
forth

certain
immemorial

Theodore
Ritter
then
cher
ami
of
Carlotta
Patti
was
a
popular
favourite
He
boasted
a
technique
that
made
him
king-pin
of
Parisian
pianists
his
real
name
was
Bennet
Only
Frangois
Plante
excelled
him
in
polish
Plante
to-day
is
over
eighty
yet
gives
the
illu
sion
of
youth
His
photograph
was
sent
me
recently
by
Isidor
Phillipp
the
director
of
the
Conservatoire
piano
classes
How
he
could
play
the
Mendelssohn
Concertos
Alkan
was
another
technician
Terrifying
are
his
studies
I
never
heard
anyone
play
them
except
Charles
Jarvis
and
Edward
McDowell
Ritter
at
the
keyboard
playing
the
slow
movement
of
the
Beethoven
Kreutzer
Sonata
with
the
first
violins
of
the
Pasdeloup
orchestra
twenty
in
number
was
more
novel
than
artistically
stimulating
But
the
pianist
was
always
sure
of
a
recall
after
he
had
played
his
own
arrangement
of
the
Bizet
Minuet
from
L
Arlesienne
At
the
Academic
des
Beaux
Arts
Mas
senet
was
nominated
to
fill
the
chair
left
vacant
by
the
death
of
Francois
Bazin
Massenet
won
favour
with
his
Les
Erinnyes
music
for
the
antique
tragedy
He
was
adored
by
the
pretty
ladies
Sybil
Sanderson
was
not
yet
in
Paris
and
his
fashionable
operas
not

Theo

Dubois
and
his
Le

I
might
go
on
for
years
and
not
exhaust
my
reminiscences
of
musical
Paris
But
there
is
a
time
for
all
things
so
let
us
talk
about
Worth
the
emperor
of
dressmakers
M
Lefevre
an
old
customer
of
the
famous
master
of
confections
introduced
me
to
M
Worth
at
his
historical
atelier
in
the
Place
Vendome
He
was
an
Englishman
aged
forty-five
or
fifty
years
His
procedure
when
com
posing
a
toilette
has
been
imitated
by
every
male
dress
maker
in
the
business
I
didn
t
see
him
in
action
that
might
have
made
me
uneasy
as
his
fair
and
fashionable
clients
were
often
forced
to
imitate
the
humble
onion
as
to
peeling
but
he
was
amiable
enough
to
give
a
list
of
the
gowns
composing
the
trousseau
of
her
Imperial
Transparency
the
Grand
Duchess
Anastasia
of
Russia
Where
are
those
virginal
Muscovites
of
yesteryear
In
Siberia
And
I
printed
the
contents
of
this
trousseau
in
my
weekly
letter
to
The
Evening
Bulletin
Imagine
me
writing
A
ball
dress
of
pink
tulle
satin
trimmed
with
garlands
formed
by
a
fringe
of
orange
blossoms
It
was
fair
reporting
and
served
to
train
my
eye
for
the
op
eratic
stage
where
costume
counts
more
than
sing
ing
After
Worth
I
was
ready
to
interview
the
Pope
which
I
actually
did
in
1905
Benjamin
Godard
s
new
Symphony-Drama
Tasso
was
liked
Victorien
Jon
cieres
had
a
not
too
flattering
reception
with
his
grand
opera
La
Reine
Berthe
This
Bertha
though
royal
had
big
feet
which
in
comic
opera
might
have
been
en
joyed
In
April
1879
Emma
Thursby
made
an
unan
nounced
debut
at
the
Pasdeloup
and
achieved
an
Adelina
Patti
triumph
She
had
sung
at
the
Chatelet
between
acts
in
Le
Desert
by
Felicien
David
but
it
was
at
the
Cirque
d
Hiver
that
she
caught
the
ear
of
the
town
She
sang
the
well-known
introduction
and
aria
from
Mozart
s
Escape
from
the
Seraglio
followed
by
the
Proch
Variations
The
critics
called
her
the
American
Nilsson
In
Mozart
and
Bellini
she
was
mistress
Her
voice
was
pure
she
sang
in
tune
and
her
musical
taste
was
admirable
The
American
colony
rallied
around
her
Thursby
was
celebrated
for
a
month
and
then
it
rained
or
snowed
Paris
forgets
as
easily
as
New
York
or
Buxtehude
I
saw
Charles
Gounod
at
a
Clotilde
Kleeberg
concert
An
interesting
romantic
head
A
young
barytone
Jean
Lasalle
appeared
in
Massenet
s
Le
Roi
de
Lahore
and
won
his
audience
His
voice
was
fruity
in
its
rich
ness
his
presence
picturesque
The
next
time
I
met
him
was
twenty
years
after
in
New
York
and
with
the
two
De
Reszkes
He
made
one
of
that
celebrated
trio
of
male
singers
at
the
Metropolitan
Opera
during
the
vocally
splendid
consulship
of
Maurice
Grau
David
s
Ode
Symphony
The
Desert
was
revived
by
Colonne
at
the
Chatelet
in
March
1879
It
was
m
y
fi
rst
hearing
and
the
Orientalism
was
delightful
that
same
colouring
which
has
since
become
cloying
in
so
many
compositions
from
Meyerbeer
to
Bloch
In
painting
it
is
become
an
abomi
nation
Even
Fortuny
that
incomparable
master
of
sunshine
and
jewelled
apparel
palls
because
of
it
Mo
scheles
called
David
s
Desert
Frenchified
but
the
Bohemian
virtuoso
was
not
a
judge
of
the
exotic
I
found
it
fascinating
The
stormy
fugue
in
the
Simoon
episode
the
chant
of
the
Muezzin
from
the
mosque
minaret
and
the
tone-painting
in
the
departure
of
the
caravan
chorus
and
orchestra
was
then
the
last
word
in
musical
realism
What
was
my
surprise
to
learn
that
Le
Desert
had
been
sung
by
the
Musical
Fund
Society
of
Philadelphia
a
quarter
of
a
century
or
more
before
I
heard
the
work
in
Paris
Poor
slow
old
Philadelphia
The
churches
of
Paris
often
saw
me
in
their
interiors
I
scoured
the
left
bank
as
well
as
the
right
of
the
Seine
looking
for
them
Across
the
river
I
first
heard
Plain
Chant
sung
as
it
should
be
better
sung
in
fact
than
at
St
Peter
s
in
Rome
as
I
was
to
find
out
in
1905
St
Marie
des
BatignoIIes
was
my
parish
but
I
went
often
to
the
services
at
St
Augustin
or
the
Trinity
I
at
tended
a
genuine
midnight
Mass
at
St
Augustin
on
a
bitterly
cold
Christmas
Eve
the
compensation
was
the
little
feast
of
wine
rilettes
bread
and
butter
which
fol
lows
in
the
household
of
any
self-respecting
Parisian
he
does
not
have
to
be
pious
Rilettes
minced
pork
I
liked
It
tasted
like
scrapple
that
Pennsylvania
product
so
ancient
that
the
memory
of
man
runneth
not
to
the
contrary
I
was
too
busy
also
too
poor
to
experience
the
Parisian
vice
in
quest
of
which
good
Americans
travel
thousands
of
miles
Of
all
the
deadly
dull
spec
tacles
commend
me
to
the
Moulin
Rouge
or
the
Bal
BuIIier
When
one
is
young
it
s
another
matter
but
one
must
be
very
young
to
enjoy
the
high
kicking
by
a
lot
of
plain
Janes
deficient
alike
in
art
or
underclothing
The
French
girl
on
the
loose
is
not
lovely
though
Paris
orders
that
sort
of
thing
better
than
in
London
where
the
halting
march
of
the
female
mob
in
Piccadilly
Circus
is
the
dreariest
picture
in
the
world
There
was
more
fun
in
the
impromptu
dances
at
the
barriers
in
the
suburbs
Poor
working
girls
clerks
on
a
lark
workmen
in
their
shirt-sleeves
art
students
and
their
Mimi
or
their
Aglae
all
furiously
footing
in
the
abandonment
of
a
dance
the
elementary
music
made
by
a
screeching
cornet
a
rasping
fiddle
with
the
brassy
sonorities
of
a
piano
as
a
background
there
was
a
joy
of
life
not
to
be
found
at
such
mournful
professional
gardens
the
Jardin
de
Paris
the
Folies
Marigny
those
slaughter-houses
of
love
where
as
Huysmans
wrote
love
is
slain
at
a
stroke
Yet
the
American
green
as
grass
whether
he
hails
from
Man
hattan
or
Manitoba
accepts
the
stencilled
humbuggery
of
the
boulevards
and
Montmartre
as
the
real
thing
Life
has
its
terrible
revenges
on
those
who
flout
her
in
youth
One
of
them
is
vice
for
the
middle-aged
in
Paris
I
studied
with
commendable
diligence
My
daily
average
of
piano
practice
was
seldom
less
than
six
hours
and
it
often
ran
up
to
the
ridiculous
number
of
ten
and
more
No
wonder
my
neighbours
complained
No
wonder
they
manifested
their
irritation
by
throwing
solid
objects
against
my
door
Unmoved
I
played
on
What
did
I
find
to
play
during
so
many
hours
Whence
came
all
the
music
I
practised
innumerable
finger
exercises
I
had
Bach
Beethoven
Schumann
Chopin
Brahms
was
to
be
in
the
foreground
years
afterwards
I
need
not
add
to
this
list
It
is
sufficient
to
fill
a
man
s
waking
hours
till
his
last
croak
isn
t
it
I
have
been
warned
about
my
refusal
to
play
cards
I
can
t
play
I
don
t
like
cards
nor
yet
billiards
chess
or
checkers
What
will
you
do
with
yourself
when
you
grow
old
if
you
don
t
play
cards
I
m
old
now
though
hardly
tottering
and
I
never
touch
cards
and
I
have
plenty
to
occupy
my
mind
Nor
do
I
golf
that
last
refuge
for
the
afflicted
on
whom
old
Uncle
Uric
has
left
his
acid
visiting
card
I
play
Bach
in
the
morning
I
read
Brown
ing
before
breakfast
to
cheer
me
up
a
poetic
fillip
and
I
play
other
music
whenever
leisure
allows
Piano
play
ing
modern
not
the
old-fashioned
finger
touch-and-go
method
employs
every
muscle
in
the
body
It
is
also
an
intellectual
exercise
of
the
highest
character
besides
liberating
an
appreciable
quantity
of
emotion
To
play
the
instrument
in
even
a
mediocre
manner
a
medi
ocrity
like
myself
demands
a
lifetime
Hence
if
health
wealth
and
the
neighbours
permit
I
hope
to
keep
at
my
music
for
at
least
a
half
century
more
Horse
flesh
is
dynamic
food
it
was
still
eaten
in
hum
ble
households
but
it
finally
proved
unpalatable
I
knew
it
was
horse
because
of
the
taste
and
colour
and
as
it
was
cheap
though
not
nasty
I
ate
it
glad
that
it
wasn
t
dog
I
became
restless
Spring
was
with
us
a
French
spring
not
the
rainy
blustering
weather
which
invariably
appears
in
America
at
the
beginning
of
the
vernal
solstice
The
sun
flooded
the
boulevards
Birds
sang
in
the
Pare
Monceau
The
little
tables
in
front
of
cafes
overflowed
into
the
street
At
street
corners
violets
made
their
debut
of
the
season
The
caressing
air
the
sparkling
humour
of
Parisian
life
had
never
seemed
so
delectable
Yet
all
beckoned
me
to
the
country
While
my
attendance
at
the
classes
of
the
Conservatoire
had
been
punctual
the
place
was
stuffy
and
the
conglomera
tion
of
noises
that
assailed
the
ears
as
we
entered
the
courtyard
made
my
nerves
revolt
M
Mathias
was
kind
but
my
admission
must
have
been
irregular
I
was
not
an
official
pupil
nor
yet
an
official
auditor
I
called
on
Theodore
Ritter
at
No
13
Rue
Taitbout
but
after
playing
for
him
the
Bizet
Minuet
his
simplified
version
he
sent
me
to
Leopold
Doutreleau
whose
home
was
on
the
Boulevard
Clichy
No
34
as
my
address
book
tells
me
I
studied
with
M
Doutreleau
both
piano
and
harmony
and
as
my
lessons
were
bi-weekly
I
struck
my
tent
shipped
my
piano
and
with
my
inconspicuous
baggage
went
to
Villiers-Ie-Bel
nine
and
a
half
miles
from
town
on
the
Northern
Railway
You
pass
St
Denis
en
route
This
village
of
Villiers
rambles
over
the
countryside
and
was
about
three
hundred
years
old
and
contained
two
thousand
inhabitants
It
is
now
an
important
sub
urb
rich
in
villas
In
the
adjoining
Ecouen
there
is
the
Chateau
of
the
Montmorenci
built
during
the
Renais
sance
given
to
the
Conde
family
by
the
original
owners
and
later
sold
to
the
Prince
de
Joinville
The
Revolution
transformed
the
historic
edifice
into
barracks
A
law
suit
followed
after
the
Restoration
which
resulted
in
the
Joinvilles
getting
the
worst
of
it
They
removed
the
stained-glass
windows
and
the
altar
from
the
private
chapel
to
their
other
residence
at
Chantilly
But
in
the
church
near
the
chateau
there
is
still
to
be
seen
a
beau
tiful
window
which
so
I
was
told
by
the
village
cure
was
whitewashed
during
the
Revolution
to
hide
it
from
the
iconoclasts
of
89
The
Montmorenci
castle
was
in
ex
cellent
repair
when
I
visited
it
in
1879
an
lt
was
a
P
proached
through
a
superb
park
avenue
of
trees
a
half
mile
long
This
chateau
and
the
villa
of
Thomas
Cou
ture
the
painter
on
the
Ecouen
highroad
were
the
chief
attractions
The
station
of
the
Northern
Railroad
is
two
miles
from
the
village
and
like
many
French
stations
bears
two
names
Villiers-Ie-Bel-Gonesse
A
tram
brought
you
to
the
main
street
There
was
a
Mayor
a
little
fat
fellow
probably
the
grocer
and
the
only
place
of
refreshment
for
man
and
beast
was
kept
by
a
peasant
named
Bouty
I
lodged
with
him
one
flight
up
in
a
long
low
building
cool
during
the
hottest
days
as
the
floors
were
flagstone
and
the
walls
whitewashed
A
bar
did
not
exist
beyond
a
sideboard
There
were
a
few
tables
and
the
establishment
literally
shone
with
cleanli
ness
My
piano
was
ensconced
in
my
bedroom
which
was
also
my
living-room
It
was
barn-like
in
dimen
sions
Therein
I
slept
played
read
ate
my
meals
when
I
didn
t
eat
in
the
cafe
on
the
ground
floor
The
cooking
was
good
the
fare
abundant
claret
of
quality
only
cost
eight
sous
a
litre
Remember
this
was
forty
years
ago
Life
was
gay
and
I
was
satisfied
I
recall
the
late
afternoon
I
arrived
as
if
it
were
etched
on
my
brain-cells
There
was
a
careless
sky
with
a
few
large
clouds
rhythmically
clustered
The
sun
possibly
tired
of
staring
at
our
mud-ball
endeavoured
to
evade
the
cosmic
time-table
and
set
before
its
hour
Gentle
veils
of
mist
were
accomplices
in
this
surreptitious
re
treat
yet
on
the
clock
second
our
parent-planet
vanished
Bands
of
birds
flew
nestward
in
palpitating
triangular
patterns
and
oh
the
melancholy
draperies
of
the
willows
You
looked
for
the
harps
of
Babylon
The
air
grew
chilly
I
was
glad
to
reach
the
hospitable
doorsill
of
the
Bouty
auberge
The
immense
presence
of
the
moon
was
like
a
silver
porthole
in
the
sky
My
first
sunrise
was
memorable
In
the
east
it
was
a
fanfare
of
brass
it
fairly
filled
the
heavens
with
its
furious
rever
berations
My
habits
were
exemplary
I
escaped
to
Paris
twice
a
week
The
Lefevre
family
lived
hard
by
in
their
villa
As
I
have
already
related
I
saw
the
master
Couture
and
struck
up
an
acquaintance
with
a
pupil
John
Dunsmore
a
young
painter
from
Cincinnati
There
was
an
artistic
couple
in
the
neighbourhood
the
Shearers
from
Reading
When
I
met
Shearer
we
dis
cussed
Lauer
or
Barbey
and
their
wholesome
home
brews
more
than
we
did
the
Barbizon
School
But
the
name
of
Millet
was
one
to
conjure
with
Couture
who
naturally
would
admire
the
Poussins
had
said
that
Millet
was
a
genius
unschooled
yet
a
genius
Isn
t
it
lamentable
this
unschooled
I
never
heard
from
his
lips
an
opin
ion
on
Corot
The
forest
of
Montmorenci
was
near
but
the
country
was
not
so
interesting
as
Grez-sur-Loing
or
the
Fontainebleau
forest
However
I
was
more
devoted
to
music
than
landscape
I
accompanied
Dunsmore
on
sketching
tours
but
the
events
of
the
week
were
my
weekly
visits
to
Paris
I
had
relinquished
the
lecture
course
at
the
Sorbonne
Outdoors
beckoned
me
and
I
loafed
and
invited
my
soul
to
drink
and
smoke
I
was
a
cigarette-smoker
cigars
came
much
later
and
the
pipe
is
still
to
come
Coffee
too
was
a
dissipation
I
drank
it
in
bowls
black
and
strong
It
never
kept
me
awake
To-day
I
work
on
tea
without
cream
and
it
is
the
most
propulsive
stimulant
to
writing
De
Quincey
called
it
the
beverage
of
the
intellectual
but
that
is
a
vain
saying
so
is
the
much
despised
barley
and
hop
brew
But
beefsteaks
omelettes
chickens
where
do
they
taste
better
than
in
the
French
provinces
Not
forgetting
the
generous
wines
Was
I
homesick
Not
in
the
least
Philadelphia
was
a
penumbra
on
my
conscious
ness
No
doubt
I
should
return
letters
were
hinting
at
the
horrid
probability
but
I
determined
to
put
off
the
tragedy
as
long
as
I
dared
The
professor
who
lectured
in
the
philosophy
classes
at
the
Sorbonne
was
a
mild
hairy
absent-minded
man
who
reminds
one
now
of
Monsieur
Bergeret
in
the
four
novels
of
Anatole
France
s
Histoire
Contemporaine
His
name
I
ve
forgotten
but
his
philosophy
a
rehash
of
Victor
Cousin
an
eclectic
thinker
I
do
remember
It
was
harmless
and
antiquated
the
thought
of
this
school
quite
in
key
with
the
precepts
of
art
inculcated
at
the
Beaux
Arts
or
the
venerable
pedagogic
methods
of
the
Con
servatoire
Official
art
and
literature
in
Paris
are
of
necessity
antipathetic
to
novelty
Yet
Balzac
and
Zola
tried
to
enter
the
French
Academy
Balzac
for
the
glory
Zola
as
he
naively
confessed
because
the
coveted
chair
and
palms
would
increase
the
sale
of
his
books
These
contradictions
puzzle
Certainly
a
central
and
invested
authority
in
matters
artistic
and
literary
is
to
be
com
mended
Matthew
Arnold
believed
in
the
Institute
but
so
many
wild
flowers
of
genius
bloomed
in
the
field
and
never
could
have
been
transplanted
to
the
dry
prim-pots
of
the
Academy
that
one
s
belief
is
confused
when
confronted
by
such
a
cloud
of
witnesses
The
big
men
in
French
literature
and
art
were
not
officially
welcomed
even
there
within
the
walls
they
would
have
prospered
the
same
if
they
had
not
knocked
for
admission
Genius
comes
not
by
compulsion
In
the
Salon
of
1879
were
pictures
worth
visiting
There
were
Degas
and
his
pupil
Mary
Cassatt
one
of
the
distinguished
painters
of
America
a
Philadelphian
and
the
sister
of
A
J
Cassatt
There
were
Raffaelli
and
the
sculptor
Bartholome
whose
monumental
tomb
in
Pere-Lachaise
was
a
starting
point
for
Saint-Gaudens
and
the
tomb
he
executed
near
Washington
I
first
saw
Mesdag
s
marines
that
cordial
old
Dutchman
whose
gallery
at
The
Hague
is
so
rich
in
modern
French
art
Fantin-Latour
was
hung
Whistler
owes
much
to
him
Gustave
Moreau
whose
alembicated
art
so
fascinated
me
at
the
Moreau
Museum
in
1900
showed
several
canvases
Flandrin
I
disliked
Puvis
de
Chavannes
his
Prodigal
Son
and
Jeunes
filles
au
bord
de
la
mer
were
on
view
Gustave
Dore
was
a
disappointment
his
Orpheus
re
vealed
his
incompetency
as
a
painter
original
as
are
his
designs
and
a
word
might
be
said
for
John
Martin
the
English
mezzotinter
whose
apocalyptic
imagination
in
his
biblical
plates
influenced
Dore
Jean
Gigoux
a
painter
who
was
in
intimate
converse
with
the
wife
of
Balzac
when
he
was
dying
in
another
room
you
think
of
George
Sand
with
Alfred
de
Musset
and
her
Pagello
at
Venice
exhibited
several
mediocre
canvases
Read
Choses
Vues
prose
by
Victor
Hugo
as
to
the
Balzac
scan
dal
since
vigorously
denied
by
Gigoux
Cabanel
s
Birth
of
Venus
picture
not
the
easel
at
the
Philadelphia
Academy
of
the
Fine
Arts
an
allegorical
panel
with
nudes
The
Venus
looked
like
an
inflated
balloon
Roll
Lefebvre
Bouguereau
Duez
Van
Beers
his
portrait
of
Sarah
Bernhardt
then
in
the
plenitude
of
her
power
a
golden
voice
at
the
Frangais
and
the
entire
official
list
were
represented
Around
the
corner
figuratively
speaking
were
Monet
Manet
Pissarro
Sisley
Berthe
Morizot
the
greatest
woman
painter
of
France
and
probably
the
greatest
in
history
for
what
were
Judith
Leyster
or
Vigee
Lebrun
in
comparison
and
the
sister-in-law
of
Manet
Guillaumin
Caillebotte
and
Zandomenechi
were
painting
but
not
recognised
which
was
the
luckiest
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
their
art
Degas
was
in
the
official
Salon
because
of
the
rectitude
of
his
design
but
not
because
of
his
original
vision
or
his
disconcerting
subjects
chiefly
race
horses
ballet-girls
and
ugly
women
washing
in
attitudes
both
batrachian
and
serpentine
of
the
operatic
voluptuousness
of
Caba
nel
there
was
no
trace
in
his
work
Like
Flaubert
Edgar
Degas
had
the
eye
of
a
surgeon
he
dissected
did
not
comment
We
look
in
vain
for
a
suggestion
of
the
prurient
or
the
diabolic
lustfulness
of
Felicien
Rops
The
humans
of
Degas
are
vital
charts
created
by
an
analytical
intellect
Cerebral
not
emotional
And
he
was
a
master
painter
a
classic
before
he
died
At
the
Salon
des
Independants
in
1880
the
revolution
ists
had
their
revenge
Impressionism
reigned
and
Paris
sniggered
The
Durand-Ruel
Galleries
were
a
rallying
point
for
the
rebels
Caillebotte
was
a
difficult
dose
to
swallow
but
you
had
to
or
offend
the
others
just
as
to-day
Cezanne
must
be
accepted
else
you
are
an
ob
scurantist
But
there
can
be
no
comparison
made
be
tween
the
patient
genius
of
Aix-en-Provence
and
the
amateur
who
bequeathed
to
the
Luxembourg
that
precious
acorn
of
impressionistic
canvases
which
finally
grew
into
a
towering
tree
now
a
tree
whose
shade
is
become
bale
ful
to
students
as
is
the
poisonous
Manchineel
tree
in
L
Africaine
Forain
and
Raffaelli
in
the
first
flush
of
their
exciting
and
truly
Parisian
art
were
a
treasure
trove
Forain
had
studied
with
Gerome
but
soon
left
him
for
Manet
where
his
satirical
talent
burgeoned
in
a
congenial
atmosphere
Mary
Cassatt
was
a
force
I
saw
the
portrait
of
Edmond
de
Goncourt
brushed
by
Bracquemond
which
had
the
hard
relief
of
a
Holbein
I
was
present
at
the
obsequies
of
the
subtle
French
prosateur
and
amateur
of
exquisite
art
in
Paris
1896
What
prose-master
has
in
a
style
deliberate
and
per
sonal
pinned
to
paper
such
ephemeral
sensations
and
the
most
fugacious
of
nuances
as
the
Goncourts
Degas
is
their
antilogue
in
painting
And
compared
with
Claude
Monet
what
official
painter
of
his
time
could
touch
his
Mozartean
serenity
of
mood
or
his
landscapes
drenched
in
rainbow
mists
His
Gare
des
BatignoIIes
after
wards
hung
in
the
Luxembourg
was
the
first
attempt
to
deal
with
a
certain
joyless
phase
of
life
The
yawning
mouth
of
the
railroad
station
the
rails
slippery
with
wet
shunting
of
many
cars
plumes
of
steam
the
myriad
of
facts
put
before
us
synthetically
abbreviated
and
en
veloped
in
an
atmosphere
that
you
could
see
smell
taste
this
canvas
was
a
contribution
to
modern
art
as
important
in
its
intentions
as
in
its
omissions
I
have
always
envisaged
Claude
Monet
as
the
only
Impressionist
as
I
believe
that
Charles
Baudelaire
was
the
greatest
French
poet
of
the
nineteenth
century
Victor
Hugo
excepted
and
only
Hugo
and
that
the
su
preme
realistic
novel
is
L
Education
Sentimentale
by
Flaubert
But
the
chief
body
of
criticism
rules
other
wise
Baudelaire
is
immoral
what
has
morality
to
do
with
art
don
t
ask
this
question
of
a
literature
professor
The
public
reads
the
vulgarisation
of
Flaubert
and
Manet
in
Zola
Oh
Manet
is
already
old
fashioned
Zola
himself
speaks
of
le
bonapartisme
sentimentale
which
precipitated
the
downfall
of
the
Second
Empire
the
Bonapartism
which
had
proved
the
undoing
of
a
generation
patterned
after
his
lurid
writings
The
daylight
clearness
of
Flaubert
and
the
delicate
arabesques
of
the
De
Goncourts
was
followed
by
the
sooty
extravagances
and
violent
melodrama
of
Zola
and
his
disciples
It
is
all
dead
and
forgotten
in
Europe
The
Russians
Dostoievsky
Tolstoy
Turgenev
Tchekov
Gorky
and
Artzibachev
intervened
The
art
of
fiction
has
become
finer
and
more
spiritual
especially
in
Eng
land
where
the
influence
of
Henry
James
is
more
potent
than
in
his
native
land
But
dear
progressive
America
is
still
in
the
throes
of
a
naturalism
which
died
at
the
birth
of
Zola
s
vilest
offspring
La
Terre
Mr
Howells
set
the
fashion
of
realism
a
tempered
realism
though
he
stemmed
from
Jane
Austen
and
Turgenev
His
is
the
art
of
the
miniature
painter
Frank
Norris
followed
him
and
Stephen
Crane
both
at
a
long
distance
preceded
by
Henry
B
Fuller
in
his
With
the
Procession
and
The
Cliff-Dwellers
Zola
was
not
a
realist
merely
be
cause
he
dealt
with
certain
unpleasant
facts
He
was
a
myopic
romanticist
writing
in
a
style
both
violent
and
tumefied
the
history
of
his
soul
in
the
latrines
of
life
Life
as
a
whole
he
never
saw
steadily
it
was
for
him
more
like
a
succession
of
lurid
lantern-slides
If
in
the
Court
of
Realism
Flaubert
is
king
then
Zola
ranks
only
as
an
excavator
But
I
must
vault
back
to
my
early
Paris
Paris
which
is
now
as
it
always
was
the
reservoir
of
spiritual
and
artistic
certitudes
I
spoke
of
Degas
and
Manet
Monet
Pissarro
Sisley
and
the
other
Impressionists
I
must
not
forget
two
names
each
important
in
his
own
depart
ment
Renoir
and
Toulouse-Lautrec
the
first
a
rare
mas
ter
the
second
an
incomplete
genius
but
one
whose
im
print
on
the
art
of
the
generation
succeeding
him
has
been
marked
Auguste
Renoir
still
lives
old
semi-crippled
an
octogenarian
yet
painting
every
day
pictures
that
are
astonishingly
strong
No
need
to
pardon
their
weaknesses
there
are
none
Vivacious
lyrical
happy
his
work
never
betrayed
a
hint
of
the
bitter
psychology
of
his
friend
Edgar
Degas
His
nudes
are
pagan
child
women
full
of
life
s
joy
sinuous
animal
unreasoning
His
genre
tableaux
are
personal
enough
the
luminous
envelope
the
gorgeous
riot
of
opposed
tones
and
delicious
dissonances
literally
transfigure
commonplace
themes
In
his
second
manner
his
affinities
with
Claude
Monet
and
Impressionism
generally
are
easily
noted
but
his
land
scapes
are
more
atmospheric
division
of
tones
invariably
practised
Everything
swims
in
an
aerial
bath
His
portraits
are
the
personification
of
frankness
The
touch
is
broad
flowing
He
was
the
first
of
the
Impressionistic
portrait-painters
to
apply
unflinchingly
the
methods
of
Manet
and
Monet
to
the
human
face
Manet
while
painting
in
clear
tones
what
magic
there
is
in
his
golden
brush
seldom
employed
the
hatchings
of
colours
except
in
his
landscapes
and
only
after
1870
when
he
came
under
the
influence
of
Monet
In
his
third
manner
Renoir
combines
his
two
earlier
techniques
painting
with
the
palette-knife
and
divided
tones
Flowers
barbaric
designs
for
rugs
fantastic
vibrating
waters
these
appear
in
the
long
and
varied
series
of
canvases
in
which
we
see
Paris
enjoying
itself
at
Bougival
on
the
Isle
Puteaux
dancing
near
the
heights
of
Montmartre
strolling
among
the
trees
at
Armenonville
Paris
quivering
with
holiday
joys
Paris
in
outdoor
humour
and
not
a
vicious
or
dis
cordant
note
in
all
this
lucid
psychology
of
sport
and
love
The
lively
chap
who
in
shirt-sleeves
dances
with
the
jolly
plump
sales
girl
the
sunlight
dripping
through
the
vivid
green
of
the
leaves
dazzling
the
edges
of
profiles
nose-tips
fingers
this
human
pair
are
not
the
sullen
work
people
of
Zola
or
Toulouse-Lautrec
nor
are
the
girls
akin
to
the
Soeurs
Vatard
of
Huysmans
or
the
human
document
of
Degas
Renoir
is
not
abysmally
profound
to
him
life
is
not
a
curse
or
a
kiss
as
we
used
to
say
in
the
days
of
Swinburne
He
is
a
painter
of
joyous
surfaces
and
he
is
an
incorrigible
optimist
He
is
also
a
poet
The
poet
of
air
sunshine
beautiful
women
shall
we
ever
forget
his
protrait
of
Jeanne
Samary
A
pantheist
withal
a
poet
and
a
direct
descendant
in
the
artistic
line
of
Watteau
Boucher
Monticelli
with
an
individual
touch
of
mundane
grace
superadded
In
a
private
collection
near
Overbrook
Pa
there
may
be
seen
the
finest
group
of
Renoirs
in
this
country
To
a
gloomier
tune
goes
the
art
of
Count
de
Toulouse
Lautrec
In
it
is
the
perverse
genius
of
an
unhappy
man
who
owes
allegiance
to
no
one
but
Degas
and
the
Japanese
At
Paris
I
visited
the
first
exhibition
devoted
to
his
work
His
astonishing
qualities
of
invention
draughtsmanship
and
a
diabolic
ingenuity
in
sounding
the
sinister
music
of
decayed
souls
never
before
had
been
assembled
under
one
roof
Power
he
has
and
a
saturnine
hatred
of
his
wretched
models
Toulouse-Lautrec
had
not
the
impersonal
vision
of
Zola
nor
the
disenchant
ing
irony
of
Degas
He
loathed
the
crew
of
repul
sive
nightbirds
which
he
pencilled
and
painted
in
old
Montmartre
before
the
foreign
invasion
diluted
its
native
spontaneous
wickedness
Now
a
resort
for
easily
bam
boozled
English
and
Americans
the
earlier
Montmartre
was
a
rich
mine
for
the
artistic
explorers
Raffaelli
went
there
and
Renoir
but
Raffaelli
was
impartially
Impres
sionistic
and
Renoir
was
ever
ravished
by
a
stray
shaft
of
sunshine
flecking
the
faces
of
the
dancers
and
recorded
in
charming
tints
Not
as
these
men
was
Toulouse
Lautrec
Combined
with
chronic
pessimism
he
possessed
a
divination
of
character
that
if
he
had
lived
longer
and
worked
harder
might
have
placed
him
near
Degas
He
is
savant
His
sensitive
line
proclaims
the
master
Unlike
Aubrey
Beardsley
his
Japanese
predilections
never
seduced
him
into
the
decoratively
abnormal
We
see
the
Moulin
Rouge
with
its
parasites
La
Goulue
and
her
vile
retainers
The
brutality
is
contemptuous
a
blow
struck
full
in
the
face
Vice
is
harshly
arraigned
This
Frenchman
s
art
makes
of
Hogarth
a
pleasing
preacher
so
drastic
is
it
so
deliberately
searching
in
its
insults
And
never
exaggeration
or
burlesque
These
brigands
and
cutthroats
pimps
and
pickpurses
are
set
before
us
without
bravado
without
the
genteel
glaze
of
the
sentimental
painter
without
the
attempt
to
call
a
prostitute
a
cocotte
His
sitters
with
their
cavernous
glare
their
emaciated
figures
and
debauched
expression
are
a
commentary
on
the
life
of
the
region
Toulouse
Lautrec
is
like
a
page
torn
from
Ecclesiastes
With
the
years
the
arts
have
become
too
explicit
all
except
the
art
of
music
even
tonal
dramas
of
Verdi
and
Wagner
tell
their
story
without
the
consoling
veils
of
ambiguity
In
literature
Browning
was
never
obscure
in
intention
he
tried
to
send
a
multiple
message
over
a
single
wire
he
packed
too
many
ideas
in
a
line
but
Stephane
Mallarme
deliberately
wrought
a
poetic
art
hermetic
like
a
flash
seen
in
a
mirror
at
midnight
charged
with
subtle
premonitions
of
music
unheard
the
silent
thunder
afloat
in
the
leaves
faint
adumbrations
of
a
dream-prose
or
verse
for
those
ten
superior
persons
scat
tered
throughout
the
universe
as
Huysmans
said
I
have
yet
to
meet
any
one
of
this
sacred
ten
this
spiritual
legion
of
Thebes
As
Arthur
Symons
has
shown
us
even
Mal
larme
is
not
wholly
cryptic
He
has
more
than
ten
readers
scattered
between
two
or
three
clubs
in
this
city
Whistler
was
once
an
enigma
His
evasive
art
when
finally
cornered
proved
to
lack
substantiality
robust
vision
a
vigorous
brush
But
a
musically
elo
quent
painter
In
orchestral
music
alone
do
the
secrets
of
the
gods
remain
inviolate
almost
for
we
are
become
gods
ourselves
and
we
have
learned
to
interpret
their
tone-language
Claude
Debussy
was
the
newest
com
poser
to
take
refuge
in
a
lovely
symbolism
What
are
the
Cubists
but
searchers
after
an
abstract
that
ordinary
representation
makes
crudely
obvious
Dancing
in
its
highest
estate
is
winged
metaphysics
Sculpture
and
architecture
are
the
most
cruelly
exposed
of
the
arts
yet
in
an
archaic
symbolism
such
as
Epstein
s
or
in
the
cold
polished
logical
ferocity
of
Brancusi
sculpture
evades
the
inexorable
linear
law
Rodin
shivered
the
syn
tax
of
stone
only
to
replace
it
with
his
ow
r
n
sensuous
rhetoric
Acting
has
its
plasticity
in
attitude
and
ges
ture
occasionally
we
see
a
soul
emerge
from
that
prison
house
of
the
theatre
more
ineluctable
than
the
canons
of
the
Medes
and
Persians
We
seldom
encounter
a
Duse
a
Booth
a
Salvini
a
Modjeska
Sada-Yacco
or
a
Sarah
Bernhardt
who
were
supreme
because
they
incarnated
the
poet
s
creations
and
not
because
of
their
professional
technique
When
we
saw
heard
them
the
acceleration
of
our
interior
life
became
almost
intolerable
because
of
its
poignancy
To
comprehend
and
feel
as
in
a
blinding
simultaneous
vision
a
synthesis
of
the
senses
what
French
psychologists
call
multanimity
as
opposed
to
unanimity
is
the
dream
of
a
few
advanced
artists
Nevertheless
mystery
in
art
is
its
chief
virtue
Is
such
an
ideal
to
be
compassed
How
unhappy
people
would
be
if
they
were
really
happy
Supreme
art
always
about
to
be
but
never
is
quite
achieved
Later
when
in
Italy
I
went
to
Bologna
to
see
a
pianist
conductor
composer
Giuseppe
Martucci
the
director
of
the
Conservatory
there
For
this
Neapolitan
musician
I
entertained
much
admiration
after
hearing
him
play
the
piano
part
of
his
own
B
flat
minor
concerto
in
true
vir
tuoso
style
and
also
old
Italian
music
by
Scarlatti
I
determined
to
seek
his
advice
His
concerto
with
his
own
changes
and
special
fingering
I
have
preserved
It
is
very
difficult
Runs
of
double-sixths
abound
As
a
pianist
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
play
double
sixths
like
Rosenthal
A
brilliant
rather
than
an
emo
tional
artist
he
was
a
conductor
of
high
rank
I
pre
ferred
Sgambati
of
Rome
in
chamber
music
but
I
have
pleasant
souvenirs
of
Martucci
Returning
to
Paris
by
a
roundabout
route
I
crossed
the
lovely
Lake
Con
stance
on
a
cool
clear
September
morning
This
lake
is
as
green
as
fabled
Erin
so
green
that
the
bellies
of
birds
hovering
about
its
bosom
are
tinged
with
emerald
tints
The
distant
prospect
of
the
Alps
is
enlivening
but
it
is
the
colour
of
the
water
its
soothing
smoothness
and
the
pink
mist
garbing
the
base
of
the
mountains
that
woo
the
eye
The
transition
to
Geneva
is
easy
Three
days
in
this
city
by
the
lake
bred
dreams
of
Italy
The
weather
was
warm
the
sky
soft
and
the
River
Rhone
a
celestial
blue
I
went
to
Ferney
saw
the
house
of
Voltaire
to
the
Saleve
and
wondered
if
Mount
Blanc
touched
the
tall
stars
to
the
villas
of
Byron
Josephine
and
Lola
Montez
to
Rousseau
s
birthplace
to
the
island
with
his
statue
to
the
cathedral
where
Calvin
preached
and
finally
to
Montreux
passing
Noyon
Merges
where
Paderewski
lived
afterwards
Evian
Ouchy
Vevay
Clarens
then
I
found
myself
again
in
Paris
I
proceeded
to
Auteuil
dear
old
delightful
restful
Auteuil
There
said
I
to
my
soul
I
shall
find
the
rest
which
passeth
all
understanding
Vance
I
wrote
to
the
poet
Thompson
find
me
a
poetic
spot
near
the
house
of
Goncourt
where
I
may
sit
on
the
balcony
and
hear
the
frogs
parse
the
more
irregular
verbs
in
their
sweet
mother-tongue
He
found
it
did
Vance
Thompson
Never
shall
I
forget
my
first
night
in
historic
Auteuil
From
my
window
I
heard
and
saw
the
trains
of
the
Chemin
de
Per
of
the
Ceinture
which
girdles
Paris
They
run
every
five
minutes
and
make
more
noise
than
may
be
heard
at
Thirty-fourth
Street
and
Broadway
If
I
tried
to
sleep
I
was
awakened
by
rude
petulant
voices
which
desperately
wrangled
choice
phrases
Cochon
Cornichon
Homard
and
again
Cornichon
as
if
one
should
say
pig
pickle
lobster
were
wafted
to
my
en
raptured
ears
I
was
in
the
pickle
the
other
blind
drunk
Then
the
climax
most
telling
an
excerpt
from
municipal
orchestration
A
brutal
machine
a
steam
roller
marched
to
and
fro
for
six
hours
horridly
crunch
ing
the
stones
and
gravel
prepared
for
its
midnight
luncheon
It
settled
my
hash
I
dressed
descended
went
across
the
street
to
the
police
station
on
Boulevard
Exelmans
and
talked
cigarette
French
to
the
amiable
officers
on
duty
The
next
day
I
told
Vance
that
his
frogs
were
railroad
frogs
and
he
retorted
by
taking
me
over
the
district
and
filling
me
to
the
eyes
with
local
anecdotes
He
lived
there
in
the
Hameau
Boileau
a
retired
hamlet
heavily
wooded
containing
a
half-dozen
villas
His
own
was
the
original
Boileau
house
bought
by
the
poet
for
8,000
livres
in
1685
On
the
Rue
Singer
Benjamin
Franklin
lived
further
down
there
is
a
street
named
after
him
Madame
Helvetius
lived
there
Franklin
as
well
as
Turgot
wanted
to
marry
her
A
perfect
nest
of
artistic
memories
is
Auteuil
Lamar

Victor

philosopher-economist
he
only
died
in
1861
at
No
10
Rue
de
Passy
Balzac
Jules
Janin
Spontini
and
Rossini
who
founded
a
home
for
old
musicians
Maison
Rossini
lived
in
the
neighbour
hood
Sandeau
and
George
Sand
once
kept
house
at
Passy
De
Musset
lived
in
Auteuil
Gavarni
Halevy
the
famous
actress
Sophie
Arnould
were
there
and
the
Goncourts
lived
at
67
Boulevard
Montmorenci
in
the
same
park
where
Vance
Thompson
was
There
too
is
the
Pool
of
Auteuil
a
most
poetic
spot
with
willows
weeping
over
its
green
waters
Hugo
Turgenev
Flau
bert
Maupassant
George
Sand
Zola
and
Goncourt
sat
at
its
triste
borders
and
no
doubt
wondered
when
dinner
would
be
ready
Poets
and
artists
are
dreamers
but
not
on
empty
stomachs
It
was
Mrs
Ralph
Waldo
Emerson
who
said
of
Henry
Thoreau
that
he
loved
and
led
a
lonely
life
but
he
never
went
beyond
hearing
of
the
dinner-bell
Rossini
s
ashes
are
not
in
Pere
Lachaise
or
in
Florence
a
joker
to
the
last
he
had
requested
that
they
should
not
bury
him
in
a
Jewish
cemetery
Naturally
I
often
went
to
Pere
Lachaise
There
lies
my
beloved
Chopin
his
heart
is
in
the
Church
of
the
Holy
Cross
Warsaw
and
his
statue
and
house
that
stood
in
his
birthplace
Zelazowa
Wola
Poland
were
destroyed
during
the
great
war
by
Russian
Cossacks
The
Paris
cemetery
is
a
most
inter
esting
place
for
one
with
a
historic
imagination
I
was
never
carried
away
by
the
graceless
Clesinger
memorial
to
Chopin
The
tombs
of
Abelard
and
Heloise
do
not
mean
much
to
the
present
generation
but
the
composer
of
Carmen
is
there
and
the
Countess
D
AgouIt
the
mother
of
Liszt
s
three
children
and
Bellini
and
Moliere
but
let
us
go
to
Montmartre
where
Heine
sleeps
and
the
Goncourts
Henry
Beyle
better
known
as
Stendhal
Ernest
Renan
Theophile
Gautier
prince
of
marmoreal
prose
Carlotta
Patti
and

The
grave
of
Ada
Isaacs
Menken
poet
actress
bareback
rider
the
greatest
of
Mazeppas
is
there
Among
her
various
marriages
was
a
brief
alliance
with
John
C
Heenan
the
prize
fighter
I
think
Ada
hailed
from
New
Orleans
and
was
not
a
Jewess
despite
her
Jewish
name
Her
letters
to
the
American
writer
Hattie
Tyng-Griswold
published
after
the
death
of
the
notorious
and
unhappy
woman
revealed
another
side
of
her
temperament
Extracts
were
printed
in
the
newspapers
She
was
a
Mazeppa
doubled
by
a
Sappho
Her
slender
volume
of
verse
entitled
Infelice
was
credited
in
part
to
Swinburne
but
that
is
nonsense
The
poet
of
Anactoria
while
he
sympathised
with
Les
bian
ladies
never
wrote
bad
poetry
But
he
knew
her
well
enough
to
be
photographed
on
the
same
plate
I
have
a
copy
I
have
also
a
photograph
of
Ada
sitting
on
the
luxurious
lap
of
the
elder
Dumas
She
was
as
versatile
in
her
affections
as
in
her
talents
A
strikingly
handsome
woman
according
to
the
report
of
her
day
her
figure
being
the
envy
of
sculptors
I
confess
it
is
difficult
to
see
the
beauty
in
her
photographs
A
tor
mented
morbid
soul
a
virile
soul
in
a
feminine
body
she
led
a
stormy
passionate
life
and
like
Lola
Montez
died
neglected
by
the
world
On
her
tomb
are
the
words
Thou
Knowest
The
real
Paris
is
not
the
city
of
junketing
visitors
the
Paris
that
clusters
or
once
clustered
about
the
grand
boulevards
Maxim
s
the
hill
of
Montmartre
all
mem
ories
for
Paris
was
spiritually
reborn
in
1914
and
other
absurd
places
No
the
real
Paris
is
the
Louvre
with
its
glorious
marbles
and
canvases
the
Luxembourg
its
palaces
and
cemeteries
above
all
its
noble
churches
If
ever
I
became
religious
to
Paris
I
should
flee
It
is
a
city
where
they
worship
artistically
Religion
is
poetic
in
Europe
AT
MAXIM
S
I
spoke
of
Maxim
s
on
the
Rue
Royale
It
wasn
t
in
existence
when
I
first
went
to
Paris
Much
later
I
spent
one
of
the
jolliest
nights
of
my
life
there
and
notwith
standing
Constable
the
English
landscapist
who
declared
that
a
good
thing
can
never
be
done
twice
I
propose
now
to
retell
the
story
which
is
in
The
Pathos
of
Distance
but
this
time
I
shall
give
the
true
names
of
the
dramatis
personae
some
are
reverend
grave
and
bearded
signers
perhaps
married
and
one
at
least
is
dead
and
his
death
was
a
loss
to
American
literature
for
he
had
the
voice
and
vision
of
an
authentic
poet
I
mean
George
Cabot
Lodge
the
son
of
Henry
Cabot
Lodge
United
States
Senator
It
would
be
hardly
fitting
to
prelude
a
rake-helly
anec
dote
by
dwelling
upon
the
virtues
of
this
lamented
young
man
s
poetic
art
That
I
shall
attempt
later
on
His
friend
Joseph
TrumbuII
Stickney
another
gifted
youth
also
at
the
Sorbonne
and
a
prize
winner
He
was
with
us
The
affair
came
about
in
this
fashion
in
company
with
a
friend
from
Boston
who
was
studying
organ
con
ducting
and
composition
Wallace
Goodrich
by
name
we
heard
a
fair
performance
of
The
Valkyre
at
the
opera
where
I
had
earlier
discovered
the
barytone
Maurice
Renaud
a
vocally
gorgeous
Wolfram
in
Tann
hauser
and
naturally
we
were
thirsty
Behind
the
opera
house
at
the
junction
of
the
streets
called
Gluck
and
Halevy
was
the
Cafe
Monferino
It
was
directed
by
an
Italian
and
a
Frenchman
who
had
been
a
head
waiter
at
Delmonico
s
New
York
The
cuisine
was
Italian
and
French
and
you
could
get
Viennese
pastry
Pilsner
beer
of
the
purest
made
the
Monferino
a
paradise
for
artists
and
writers
The
Figaro
s
office
was
around
the
corner
and
I
often
saw
the
editorial
staff
for
the
most
part
bearded
and
wearing
silk
hats
during
the
dog-days
sitting
for
hours
sipping
the
blond
brew
ges
ticulating
and
violently
thinking
aloud
Here
it
was
I
interviewed
an
ex-King
of
Servia
more
of
him
anon
I
asked
Goodrich
if
he
too
was
athirst
Yes
he
was
Soon
the
tempo
became
swifter
We
drank
from
huge
mugs
for
several
hours
while
discussing
Wagnerian
lead
ing-motives
It
was
midnight
long
past
when
Goodrich
exclaimed
Let
s
go
to
Maxim
s
To
any
spot
in
Paris
I
answered
where
recollections
of
a
French
opera
can
be
drowned
in
amber
as
is
the
fly
of
the
fable
We
drove
to
Maxim
s
which
as
any
church
going
American
knows
is
not
far
from
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
As
we
forced
our
powerful
personalities
through
a
mob
of
men
women
waiters
and
crashing
furious
music
I
said
Lo
art
thou
in
Arcadia
Goodrich
soon
spied
a
table
surrounded
by
a
gang
of
young
fellows
howling
Constant
Constant
I
wasn
t
foolish
enough
to
interpret
this
combination
of
imprecation
and
cajolement
as
an
adjective
yet
I
couldn
t
at
first
see
Constant
I
was
speedily
introduced
to
six
of
my
countrymen
mostly
hailing
from
New
York
and
after
solemnly
bowing
and
suspiciously
staring
at
their
friend
Goodrich
they
quite
as
solemnly
shook
hands
one
with
the
other
then
yelled
in
unison
Constant
I
rejoiced
My
heart
told
me
that
I
was
with
the
right
crowd
Constant
appeared
and
as
he
bowed
his
round
sleek
head
for
the
commande
I
tried
to
untangle
the
fritilant
delirium
encompassing
me
A
red-haired
woman
who
looked
like
a
big
salacious
Cheret
poster
furiously
waltzed
and
sprawled
and
slid
as
the
gypsy
band
vertig
inously
played
She
had
in
tow
a
little
chap
whose
eyes
bulged
with
joy
and
realised
ambition
He
possessed
the
largest
lady
in
the
building
what
more
could
he
ex
pect
The
band
was
wonderful
It
ripped
and
buzzed
with
rhythmic
rubato
rage
and
tore
Czardas
passion
to
ragtime
tatters
It
leered
sang
swooned
sighed
snarled
sobbed
and
leaped
Its
leader
a
dark
gypsy
with
a
wide
bold
glance
swayed
as
he
smote
the
strings
with
his
bow
and
I
was
shocked
when
he
collected
coin
plate
in
hand
At
the
tables
sat
women
and
men
The
moral
weather
was
scarlet
the
toilettes
admirable
Occasionally
there
strayed
in
British
tourists
but
if
they
had
their
women
folk
with
them
they
fled
if
not
they
remained
I
saw
nothing
objectionable
the
establishment
simply
overflowed
with
good-humoured
deviltry
The
tone
was
unmistakably
scarlet
and
as
the
night
wore
apace
it
became
a
rich
carmilion
a
colour
said
to
be
a
com
pound
of
carmine
and
vermilion
also
lobster
cham
pagne
and
rouge
Wallace
suddenly
cried
Constant
Constant
The
singing
ceased
at
our
table
Let
s
get
a
room
with
a
piano
Constant
Constant
we
screamed
and
soon
the
active
Constant
conducted
us
up-stairs
into
an
apartment
with
a
shabby
upright
piano
Beer
had
become
a
watery
nuisance
champagne
was
or
dered
and
my
voice
trembled
as
I
gave
the
order
for
I
knew
the
ways
of
young
America
when
in
Paris
We
had
already
absorbed
enough
to
float
a
three-masted
schooner
Constant
left
us
after
making
a
piteous
appeal
not
to
awaken
Napoleon
in
his
stony
lodgment
across
the
Seine
Then
Master
Goodrich
sat
down
before
the
shaky
in
strument
and
without
preluding
began
playing
what
do
you
suppose
Old-time
negro
melodies
and
those
boys
started
to
sing
and
dance
with
frantic
and
national
emotion
It
s
a
curious
thing
but
syncopation
must
be
in
our
blood
Joe
Hunt
the
architect
and
son
of
his
famous
father
Richard
Hunt
he
wore
his
hair
and
whisk
ers
a
la
Victor
Capoul
sang
Irish
songs
with
an
enviable
accent
He
was
a
pupil
of
the
Beaux-Arts
but
it
was
his
Saturday
off
and
he
proposed
to
spend
it
in
a
reason
able
fashion
Two
young
men
studying
at
the
Sorbonne
said
some
cold
classic
words
from
Racine
but
broke
into
a
wild
jig
when
were
sounded
the
stirring
measures
of
that
sweet
old
darky
lyric
My
gal
My
gal
I
m
goin
for
to
see
We
fought
double-handed
We
impro
vised
tugs
of
war
with
a
richly
brocaded
table-cloth
We
pranced
we
galloped
we
upset
furniture
and
every
time
a
blue-eyed
lad
exclaimed
in
a
fragile
voice
Oh
I
want
to
dance
with
a
nice
girl
we
smothered
him
in
the
richly
brocaded
table-cloth
It
was
not
the
hour
for
girlish
blandishments
but
for
stern
masculine
rioting
Accordingly
we
rioted
Since
I
have
marvelled
at
the
endurance
of
Wallace
who
braved
the
ivory
teeth
and
cacophonous
bark
of
a
peculiarly
vicious
piano
When
I
asked
him
to
resign
his
post
and
give
my
aching
fingers
a
chance
he
refused
but
he
was
pulled
from
the
stool
and
a
magnum
poured
down
his
neck
Then
I
sat
down
and
started
in
with
the
Revolutionary
study
of
Chopin
Darkness
supervened
as
I
was
lassoed
by
that
revenge
ful
table-cloth
and
dragged
over
the
floor
by
the
strong
arms
of
a
half-dozen
Yankee
boys
I
long
nursed
three
violet-coloured
bruises
a
triple
testimony
to
the
Chopin
hating
phalanx
from
the
Beaux-Arts
and
the
Sorbonne
We
relaxed
not
for
a
second
our
endeavours
to
chase
merriment
around
the
clock
After
more
big
cold
bottles
a
new
psychical
phase
manifested
itself
for
raging
and
war
s
alarums
was
substituted
a
warm
tender
senti
mentalism
We
cried
to
the
very
heavens
that
we
were
all
jolly
good
fellows
and
that
no
one
dared
deny
Con
stant
came
up
to
deny
it
but
corks
crackers
napkins
and
vocal
enthusiasm
drove
him
below
stairs
Only
when
the
two
young
men
from
the
Sorbonne
went
out
upon
the
balcony
and
in
stentorian
tones
informed
the
budding
dawn
and
a
lot
of
sleepy
coachmen
that
it
was
the
Fourth
of
July
and
that
America
was
God
s
own
country
did
the
counsels
of
the
trusty
Constant
prevail
and
order
was
temporarily
restored
But
the
glimpse
of
awkward
daylight
began
to
tell
on
our
nocturnal
nerves
Our
inspiration
flagged
as
a
beer
thirst
set
in
and
beer
meant
dissolution
among
us
were
some
who
were
no
lovers
of
the
barley
fruit
that
grows
in
breweries
besides
the
pace
had
been
killing
Maestro
Goodrich
came
to
the
rescue
Tossing
off
a
celery
glass
of
bubbles
he
re
sumed
his
seat
at
the
dog-house
meaning
the
piano
and
began
those
mystically
intense
measures
of
the
Prelude
to
Tristan
and
Isolde
Another
psychical
tempest
set
in
The
romping
justing
hullabalooing
ceased
and
a
melancholy
madness
prevailed
For
some
temperaments
the
music
of
Tristan
is
emotional
catnip
We
wriggled
and
we
chanted
and
submitted
to
the
spell
of
the
opium-charged
harmonies
Wagner
proved
our
Waterloo
Maxim
s
will
stand
anything
but
Wagner
in
the
cruel
early
morn
Good
rich
was
a
musical
trance-medium
and
as
six
o
clock
sounded
from
adjacent
belfries
we
tumbled
down-stairs
into
the
crude
daylight
Six
or
was
it
eight
American
citizens
blinked
like
owls
as
a
small
mob
of
coachmen
hovered
around
them
A
lovely
Sunday
morning
Huge
blocks
of
sunlight
fanned
by
the
soft
breezes
slanted
up
the
Rue
Royale
from
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
A
solitary
woman
stood
in
the
modulated
shadow
of
a
doorway
The
fantastic
dream-flowers
on
her
wide
brimmed
hat
clouded
her
features
Her
costume
was
rich
her
style
Parisian
She
waited
in
the
cool
shade
Her
sullen
crimson
mouth
affrighted
us
Her
jaw
was
animal
and
I
detected
in
her
countenance
a
blending
of
two
races
Ah
how
sinister
she
seemed
It
is
the
Morocco
Woman
whispered
one
of
the
boys
It
is
the
Woman
from
Morocco
we
shudderingly
acquiesced
as
we
moved
across
the
way
I
never
discovered
the
identity
of
this
mysterious
Morocco
Woman
Probably
some
nurse-girl
going
to
early
Mass
But
we
saw
things
melodramatically
at
that
hour
and
a
vampire
she
surely
was
After
two
of
the
crowd
escaped
arrest
while
trying
to
steal
a
sentry-box
we
rented
carriages
and
told
the
drivers
to
seek
beer-land
The
Madeleine
looked
grey
and
classically
disdainful
as
we
turned
into
the
grand
boule
vard
where
in
the
gleaming
current
of
sunshine
we
lifted
up
our
voices
and
told
Paris
how
happy
we
were
At
Julian
s
we
stopped
Up
two
heavily
carpeted
stairways
we
mounted
only
to
find
banality
There
were
a
few
belated
nighthawks
who
preened
as
we
entered
but
we
were
Sons
of
Morning
and
sought
not
the
Avaries
of
the
Night
No
beer
but
lots
of
coffee
We
promptly
scorned
such
chicory
capitulation
and
once
more
touched
the
sidewalk
Our
coachmen
who
had
been
with
us
since
we
left
the
Cafe
Monferino
began
to
show
signs
of
wear
and
tear
They
had
celebrated
our
national
holi
day
with
a
drink
every
fifteen
minutes
Yet
they
did
not
weaken
only
swore
that
every
place
except
the
churches
was
bolted
We
had
melted
in
number
Two
traitors
fled
Cowards
we
jeered
for
we
hated
to
give
in
to
sleep
After
meditation
the
drivers
uttered
strange
calls
to
their
rusty
horses
and
then
I
lost
my
bearings
We
drove
up
side
streets
into
back-alleys
leading
into
other
alleys
through
tortuous
defiles
and
into
open
clattering
squares
At
last
we
reached
a
cafe
a
rendez
vous
for
coachmen
Alas
it
was
too
late
to
pick
our
company
our
withers
were
still
unwrung
and
the
general
sentiment
was
that
the
devil
could
catch
the
hindmost
Oh
we
were
lucid
enough
it
was
our
parched
gullets
that
spurred
us
on
to
new
conquests
We
pell-melled
into
the
building
and
found
a
choice
gathering
Coachmen
cocottes
broken
down
foreigners
the
rag-tag
and
bob-tail
the
veriest
refuse
of
Parisian
humanity
Our
entrance
was
received
with
a
shout
They
knew
a
good
thing
They
were
disappointed
We
were
exclusive
Of
course
we
treated
every
lost
soul
in
the
place
that
was
only
our
chivalry
But
the
beer
sobered
us
One
scion
of
American
industrial
wealth
casually
remarked
I
never
knew
Paris
held
so
many
thirsty
people
It
sounded
like
an
echo
from
the
Tenderloin
We
squared
financial
matters
and
after
fighting
off
the
manoeuvring
of
some
shady
persons
we
escaped
Our
coachmen
who
had
almost
succumbed
managed
to
introduce
to
us
an
aged
bootblack
from
Corsica
who
had
fought
and
bled
with
the
First
Consul
We
believed
all
he
said
for
ten
cen
times
and
with
a
last
View
Hallo
we
drove
down
anony
mous
lanes
cheered
by
the
most
awful
crew
of
blackguards
outside
a
Balzac
novel
The
hot
sun
set
us
to
thinking
of
life
and
its
respon
sibilities
One
man
spoke
of
his
mother
way
back
in
Kansas
and
as
his
voice
broke
the
landscape
was
blurred
by
our
unshed
tears
Another
blurted
out
that
he
had
a
dejeuner
promised
to
an
impossible
cousin
Him
we
rallied
But
we
were
all
positive
that
we
must
appear
midday
at
the
American
Embassy
there
to
hear
the
Declaration
of
Independence
read
by
our
Minister
Was
it
not
the
glorious
Fourth
Were
we
not
brethren
and
citizens
It
was
only
eight
o
clock
an
easy
engagement
to
keep
Wallace
Goodrich
left
us
and
his
departure
made
a
profound
cavity
in
our
united
consciousness
The
party
was
thinning
The
Lord
knows
what
might
happen
in
an
hour
Perhaps
solitary
confinement
in
my
bed
I
was
foolish
enough
to
confess
that
I
had
with
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
a
young
architect
living
in
the
Latin
quarter
Name
name
was
cried
AI
drich
He
is
the
brother
of
my
friend
Richard
Aldrich
the
music-critic
of
New
York
A
chorus
of
roars
was
the
response
Why
didn
t
you
say
so
before
He
lives
in
our
house
We
ll
drive
you
there
We
were
now
four
the
others
had
melted
into
the
middle-distance
We
forgot
their
names
But
never
shall
I
forget
the
introduction
when
we
reached
that
house
On
the
fifth
floor
there
lived
sixteen
architects
students
all
at
the
Beaux
Arts
that
is
they
seemed
that
number
I
swear
that
two
young
men
bearing
the
name
of
Aldrich
arose
from
his
bed
to
salute
me
I
laughed
I
didn
t
know
Dick
Aldrich
had
twin
brothers
in
Paris
I
expostulated
He
was
perfectly
angelic
considering
that
he
had
been
aroused
from
an
enviable
Sunday
morning
slumber
Perhaps
my
obliquity
of
vision
was
the
result
of
atmos
pheric
refraction
a
liquid
Parisian
mirage
It
never
happened
to
me
but
once
before
and
then
may
the
gods
give
me
joy
the
victim
of
my
optical
illusion
was
a
girl
Can
you
conceive
anything
more
delightful
than
finding
two
girls
you
love
where
there
was
one
before
I
say
that
you
love
otherwise
the
experience
must
be
blood-curdling
But
the
young
devils
in
whose
com
pany
I
found
myself
were
not
satisfied
with
this
tame
climax
They
went
from
room
to
room
bed
to
bed
shouting
Hello
old
son
here
is
a
man
from
New
York
with
a
letter
from
your
brother
and
many
pairs
of
pyjamas
drugged
with
dreams
politely
arose
bowed
shook
hands
and
cursing
us
heartily
because
not
one
boasted
a
brother
they
would
fall
into
bed
again
All
perfect
things
must
end
and
without
remembering
the
modulation
to
the
street
I
found
myself
alone
in
front
of
the
Care
Montparnasse
I
was
cold
sober
I
knew
this
because
of
the
way
the
passing
citizens
gazed
at
me
Presently
I
engaged
in
a
discussion
with
a
rail
road
employee
about
the
comparative
wage-earning
of
Paris
and
Philadelphia
An
hour
later
I
enjoyed
the
hallucination
of
sitting
at
a
little
table
in
the
Cafe
Mon
ferino
drinking
white
wine
said
to
be
superior
to
the
hair
of
the
dog
that
bit
you
with
a
bearded
and
friendly
stranger
who
spoke
fluently
about
the
psychic
life
of
micro-organisms
The
proprietor
told
me
afterwards
that
it
was
the
illustrious
scientist
Alfred
Binet
How
I
deplored
my
lost
chance
to
ask
him
a
lot
of
questions
I
was
a
member
of
the
Academy
of
Natural
Sciences
on
Logan
Square
and
had
regularly
attended
the
Tuesday
night
meetings
and
heard
lecture
such
giants
as
Leidy
and
Cope
the
paleontologist
not
to
mention
the
Rev
erend
McCook
on
bee-hives
At
eleven
o
clock
I
knew
the
game
was
up
and
in
a
dignified
though
not
chas
tened
mood
I
rode
over
to
the
Impasse
du
Maine
where
I
lived
in
a
studio
once
occupied
by
Bastien
Lepage
when
he
painted
the
portrait
of
Sarah
Bernhardt
and
where
he
coughed
in
company
with
that
brilliant
consump
tive
Russian
girl
Marie
Bashkirtseff
I
threw
myself
on
the
bed
for
a
brief
snooze
I
awoke
feeling
refreshed
and
as
the
blinds
were
down
I
scratched
a
match
and
looked
at
my
watch
Just
twelve
o
clock
I
had
no
time
to
lose
Brushing
my
hair
changing
linen
I
went
into
the
corridor
It
was
black
as
pitch
No
wonder
Midnight
and
my
nap
had
consumed
a
dozen
hours
I
unfortunately
missed
the
celebration
at
the
American
Embassy
but
I
had
dispensed
much
patriotism
during
the
night
before
I
learned
that
all
of
the
boys
were
at
the
Embassy
Other
things
equal
I
didn
t
regret
our
evening
at
Maxim
s
on
the
Rue
Royale
I
INTERVIEW
THE
POPE
Perhaps
Rome
at
a
superficial
glance
affects
the
Ameri
can
visitor
as
a
provincial
city
sprawled
to
unnecessary
lengths
over
its
seven
hills
as
it
did
Taine
more
than
a
half
century
ago
and
despite
the
smartness
of
its
new
quarters
it
is
far
from
suggesting
a
World-City
as
do
mundane
Paris
and
London
But
not
for
Rome
and
her
superb
and
imperial
indifference
are
the
seductive
spells
of
operatic
Venice
or
the
romantic
glamour
of
Florence
She
can
proudly
say
La
Ville
c
est
moi
She
is
not
only
a
city
but
the
city
of
cities
and
twenty
four
hours
submergence
in
her
atmosphere
makes
you
a
slave
at
her
eternal
chariot
wheels
The
New
York
cockney
devoted
to
his
cult
of
the
modern
hotels
baths
cafes
luxurious
theatres
soon
wearies
of
Rome
He
prefers
Paris
or
Naples
See
Naples
and
die
of
its
odours
I
know
of
no
city
where
you
formulate
an
ex
pression
of
like
or
dislike
so
quickly
as
in
Rome
You
are
its
friend
or
foe
within
five
minutes
after
you
leave
its
dingy
railway
station
It
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
the
newer
city
pretentious
hard
and
showy
is
quite
negligible
One
does
not
go
to
Rome
to
seek
the
glazed
comforts
of
Brooklyn
I
went
there
in
1905
to
interview
Pope
Pius
X
I
am
ahead
of
my
story
but
as
we
are
in
Europe
we
had
better
remain
there
till
I
tell
it
Philadelphia
is
looming
again
with
increasing
distinctness
on
the
skyline
and
soon
we
shall
be
back
again
The
usual
manner
of
approaching
the
Holy
Father
is
to
visit
the
American
Embassy
and
harry
the
good-tempered
secretary
into
promising
an
invitation
card
if
you
are
not
acquainted
in
clerical
circles
I
was
not
long
in
the
city
before
I
discovered
that
both
Monsignor
Merry
del
Val
and
Monsignor
Kennedy
were
at
Frascati
enjoying
a
hard-earned
vacation
So
I
dismissed
the
ghost
of
the
idea
and
pursued
my
studies
in
pagan
sculpture
at
the
Museo
Vaticano
The
pictures
at
Florence
are
more
varied
but
at
Rome
there
are
only
masterpieces
If
I
admired
the
Raphael
of
the
Stanze
how
much
more
did
I
admire
his
portraiture
Not
in
the
Madonnas
but
in
the
portraits
of
his
contemporaries
is
to
be
found
the
true
artist
of
Urbino
Michelangelo
is
so
massive
in
his
grandeur
that
at
first
he
stuns
In
the
end
I
forget
the
Last
Judgment
for
his
sculpture
I
recalled
what
Boucher
said
to
Fragonard
who
was
going
to
Rome
If
you
take
those
people
over
there
seriously
you
are
done
for
Luckily
for
us
Fragonard
did
not
take
the
Italian
school
seriously
and
remained
his
own
charming
Gallic
self
Velasquez
did
not
like
Raphael
His
opinion
is
recorded
How
could
he
and
be
Velasquezy
the
great
est
painter
of
them
all
with
the
possible
exception
of
Jan
Vermeer
of
Delft
Michelangelo
Da
Vinci
Rem
brandt
were
great
visionaries
yet
the
Spaniard
was
their
master
in
brushwork
and
he
too
possessed
supreme
vision
not
nocturnal
but
daylight
vision
not
a
poet
seer
philosopher
nevertheless
he
recreated
every-day
life
with
the
intensity
born
of
veritable
hallucination
Go
to
the
Museum
on
the
Prado
in
Madrid
and
see
Las
Meninas
Las
Hilanderas
and
the
noblest
bat
tle
picture
in
the
world
The
Surrender
at
Breda
and
if
the
Dresden
Madonna
and
The
Transfiguration
still
win
your
suffrage
then
your
taste
is
to
be
commended
for
its
childlike
piety
but
not
for
artistic
reasons
After
the
electric
vitality
of
Velasquez
s
line
after
his
tonal
magic
versatile
characterisation
and
atmospheric
veri
similitude
few
other
painters
there
are
who
in
compari
son
do
not
seem
flabby
insipid
incomplete
Yet
I
love
Raphael
s
portraits
of
Pope
Julius
II
Pope
Leo
X
and
his
two
cardinals
These
portraits
are
in
the
Pitti
Pal
ace
Florence
The
heavy
hoofs
of
three
hundred
pilgrims
invaded
the
peace
of
the
Hotel
Fischer
up
the
Via
Sallustiana
where
I
lived
They
had
come
bearing
Peter
s
Pence
and
wearing
queer
clothes
The
third
day
after
their
arrival
I
got
wind
of
a
projected
audience
at
the
Vatican
Big
boned
Monsignor
Pick
daily
visited
the
hotel
and
when
I
saw
him
in
conference
with
Signor
Fischer
I
asked
the
proprietor
if
it
were
possible
Anything
is
possible
in
Rome
responded
the
wily
Fischer
Wear
evening
dress
Nonsense
That
was
a
custom
in
the
more
exacting
days
of
Leo
XIII
Pope
Pius
X
is
a
democrat
He
hates
vain
show
Possibly
he
has
absorbed
the
English
antipathy
to
seeing
evening
dress
on
a
male
dur
ing
daylight
But
the
ladies
must
wear
lace
veils
in
lieu
of
hats
I
was
in
high
spirits
I
was
to
see
the
Pope
The
morning
of
October
5
1905
the
hotel
was
crowded
with
Italians
selling
veils
to
the
female
pilgrims
Car
riages
blocked
the
streets
and
stretched
around
the
Palazzo
Margherita
from
my
windows
I
often
saw
the
Dowager
Queen
with
her
ladies
of
honour
slowly
walking
under
the
palm
and
cypress
trees
on
melancholy
autumn
evenings
There
was
much
noise
There
were
explosive
sounds
as
bargains
were
made
Then
after
the
vendors
of
saints
pictures
crosses
rosaries
chiefly
gentlemen
of
Jewish
persuasion
comical
as
it
may
appear
we
drove
away
in
high
feather
nearly
four
hundred
strong
Through
the
offices
of
my
amiable
host
I
had
secured
from
Monsignor
Pick
a
parti-coloured
badge
with
a
cross
and
the
motto
Cologne
Rome
1905
It
was
as
exciting
as
a
first
night
at
the
opera
The
rendezvous
was
at
the
Campo
Santo
dei
Tedeschi
which
with
its
adjoining
church
of
Santa
Maria
delta
Pieta
had
been
donated
by
Pius
VI
to
German
residents
as
a
burying-ground
There
I
met
my
companions
of
the
hotel
and
after
an
interrogation
regarding
my
religion
by
a
priest
I
was
permitted
to
join
the
procession
In
Rome
any
road
may
lead
to
the
Pope
It
was
for
me
a
matter
of
life
or
death
After
standing
above
the
dust
and
buried
bones
of
the
forgot
ten
dead
we
went
into
the
church
and
were
chilled
by
a
worthy
cleric
who
in
a
long
address
told
us
that
we
were
to
meet
the
Vicar
of
Christ
a
human
being
like
ourselves
He
emphasised
the
humanity
of
the
mighty
Prelate
before
whom
we
were
bidden
that
gloomy
after
noon
We
intoned
the
Te
Deum
and
filed
out
in
pairs
first
the
women
then
the
men
over
the
naked
stones
till
we
reached
the
end
of
the
Via
della
Fonda
menta
The
pilgrims
wore
their
every-day
clothes
Short
cloaks
and
Swiss
hunters
hats
prevailed
We
left
our
sticks
and
umbrellas
in
the
garderobe
which
did
a
thriv
ing
business
We
mounted
innumerable
staircases
We
reached
the
Sala
Regia
I
had
hoped
it
would
be
the
more
spacious
Sala
Ducale
Three
o
clock
was
the
hour
set
for
the
audience
but
His
Holiness
was
closeted
with
a
French
Eminence
and
there
was
delay
We
spent
it
in
staring
at
the
sacred
and
profane
frescoes
of
Daniele
da
Volterra
Vasari
Sal
viato
and
Zucchero
and
then
in
staring
at
one
another
The
women
despite
their
Italian
veils
looked
hopelessly
plain
the
men
clumsy
and
ill
at
ease
They
made
un
couth
and
guttural
noises
Pious
folk
but
without
man
ners
Conversation
proceeded
amain
Some
pilgrims
were
heavily
laden
with
crucifixes
and
rosaries
for
which
they
desired
the
blessing
of
the
Holy
Father
One
young
priest
from
America
was
bedecked
with
pious
emblems
It
is
against
the
rule
to
bring
such
things
into
the
Pope
s
presence
consequently
every
one
breaks
the
rule
A
pia
fraus
as
we
said
at
the
law
school
The
guilty
feeling
which
had
assailed
me
as
I
passed
the
watchful
gaze
of
the
Swiss
Guard
was
dissipated
The
Sala
Regia
wore
an
unfamiliar
aspect
though
I
had
been
haunting
it
and
the
Sistine
Chapel
for
a
month
past
At
last
a
murmur
His
Holiness
The
nervous
tension
was
be
come
unpleasant
We
had
been
waiting
over
an
hour
We
were
ranged
on
either
side
of
the
Sala
the
women
to
the
right
the
men
to
the
left
of
the
throne
which
was
an
ordinary
tribune
It
must
be
confessed
that
the
noisy
sex
were
vigorously
elbowed
to
the
rear
In
America
these
women
would
have
been
well
to
the
front
but
the
polite
male
pilgrims
evidently
indulge
in
no
such
ideas
of
sex
equality
They
usurped
the
good
places
by
sheer
strength
A
tall
man
in
evening
clothes
solitary
in
this
respect
with
the
exception
of
the
Pope
s
personal
suite
patrolled
the
floor
followed
by
the
Suisse
a
murrain
on
Michelangelo
s
taste
if
he
designed
such
hideous
uni
forms
I
fancied
this
major-domo
was
no
less
than
a
prince
of
the
royal
blood
so
haughty
his
bearing
When
I
heard
that
he
was
a
Roman
correspondent
on
some
foreign
newspaper
my
respect
for
the
power
of
the
press
increases
He
comes
This
time
it
was
not
a
false
alarm
From
a
gallery
facing
the
Sistine
Chapel
entered
the
inevitable
Swiss
Guard
followed
by
the
officers
of
the
Papal
household
a
knot
of
ecclesiastics
wearing
purple
Monsignor
Pick
the
Papal
prothonotary
and
a
man
of
importance
then
a
few
stragglers
anonymous
persons
stout
bald
officials
finally
Pope
Pius
X
He
was
attired
in
purest
white
even
to
the
sash
that
encompassed
his
plump
little
per
son
A
gold
cross
depended
from
his
neck
He
held
out
his
hand
to
be
kissed
in
the
most
matter-of-fact
way
I
noted
the
whiteness
of
the
nervously
energetic
hand
tendered
me
which
bore
the
ring
of
Peter
a
large
square
emerald
surrounded
by
diamonds
Though
seventy
he
looked
ten
years
younger
He
was
slightly
under
medium
height
His
hair
was
white
his
face
dark
red
veined
and
not
healthy
He
needed
more
air
and
exercise
The
great
gardens
of
the
Vatican
Palace
were
no
com
pensation
for
this
man
homesick
for
the
sultry
lagoons
and
stretches
of
gleaming
waters
in
his
old
diocese
at
Venice
If
the
human
in
him
could
have
called
out
it
would
have
voiced
Venice
not
the
Vatican
The
flesh
of
his
face
was
what
painters
call
ecclesiastical
that
is
coarse
in
grain
his
nose
broad
unaristocratic
his
brows
strong
and
harmonious
His
eyes
may
have
been
brown
but
they
seemed
black
brilliant
piercing
He
moved
with
silent
alertness
I
saw
with
satisfaction
the
shapely
ears
musical
ears
their
lobes
freely
detached
A
certain
resemblance
to
Pius
IX
there
was
but
not
so
amiable
looking
I
found
another
than
the
Pope
I
had
expected
This
then
was
the
man
of
sor
rows
the
exile
though
in
his
native
land
a
prisoner
within
sight
of
the
city
over
which
he
was
the
spiritual
ruler
a
prince
of
all
principalities
and
dominions
Withal
a
feeble
old
man
whose
life
would
have
been
imperilled
if
he
had
ventured
into
the
streets
of
Rome
The
Pope
finished
the
circle
of
pilgrims
and
stood
at
the
other
end
of
the
Sala
With
him
were
his
chamber
lains
and
ecclesiastics
Suddenly
from
a
balcony
came
a
voice
which
bade
us
come
nearer
I
was
amazed
This
was
going
back
to
the
prose
of
life
with
a
vengeance
However
we
obeyed
instructions
A
narrow
vista
was
made
with
the
Pope
in
the
middle
perspective
The
voice
which
issued
from
the
mouth
of
a
bearded
parson
behind
a
glittering
camera
cried
in
peremptory
and
true
photographer
accents
One
two
three
Thanks
Your
Holiness
And
so
we
were
photographed
In
the
Vat
ican
and
photographed
on
the
same
plate
with
the
Pope
of
Rome
It
seemed
incredible
Old
Rome
sometimes
has
surprises
for
patronising
visitors
from
the
New
World
Then
His
Holiness
mounted
the
throne
and
received
the
director
of
the
pilgrims
I
had
my
turn
being
introduced
by
Monsignor
Pick
who
informed
him
that
I
was
an
American
music-critic
in
search
of
Plain-Chant
The
Pope
at
once
was
interested
as
he
had
recently
inaug
urated
reforms
in
the
church
choirs
of
the
world
He
asked
me
how
I
liked
the
music
in
Rome
and
then
and
there
I
expected
excommunication
for
I
told
the
whole
truth
The
previous
Sunday
I
heard
a
Mass
which
was
sung
with
much
satisfaction
by
the
Sistine
choir
of
male
soprani
and
contralti
in
St
Peter
s
I
had
been
informed
that
the
eunuch
singer
no
longer
existed
nevertheless
I
heard
a
male
soprano
deliver
with
art
and
elegance
the
roulades
trills
scales
and
flourishes
generally
which
no
masculine
throat
could
have
achieved
The
timbre
of
the
artificial
soprano
is
agreeable
boyish
yet
with
an
ambigu
ous
quality
In
a
word
sexless
His
Holiness
didn
t
rel
ish
my
news
He
said
something
in
Italian
to
a
secretary
who
immediately
jotted
down
the
instruction
on
his
tab
lets
We
conversed
in
French
The
accent
of
the
Pope
was
Italian
I
stood
after
the
preliminary
kneeling
But
when
I
answered
his
question
concerning
the
recep
tion
in
the
United
States
of
the
new
law
affecting
church
music
I
was
poked
in
the
ribs
by
Monsignor
Pick
who
didn
t
think
my
answer
sufficiently
diplomatic
Perhaps
it
wasn
t
but
again
my
naivete
compelled
me
to
say
that
Gregorian
chant
was
hardly
popular
in
my
native
land
Feeling
that
I
was
lost
I
fell
on
my
knees
and
kissed
the
magic
ring
and
the
interview
was
at
an
end
The
Pope
addressed
his
audience
in
a
ringing
bary
tone
He
blessed
us
and
his
singing
voice
proved
rich
resonant
and
pure
for
an
old
man
The
pilgrims
thun
dered
the
Te
Deum
a
second
time
with
such
fervour
that
the
historical
walls
of
the
Sala
Regia
shook
with
the
vibrations
of
their
lungs
Then
the
Papal
suite
trailed
after
the
Pontiff
and
the
buzzing
began
among
the
pil
grims
The
women
wished
to
know
and
indignant
were
their
inflections
why
a
certain
lady
dressed
in
scarlet
hats
and
gloves
the
same
worldly
colour
was
permitted
within
the
sacred
precincts
No
one
knew
The
men
hurried
to
the
garderobe
and
jostled
the
keepers
for
their
umbrellas
Laden
with
their
holy
objects
unconsciously
blessed
by
the
Pope
the
owners
of
rosary-beads
pictures
medals
and
scapulars
were
envied
We
broke
ranks
and
outside
we
found
sunlight
A
happy
omen
I
waited
for
Monsignor
Pick
a
man
and
a
brother
I
took
him
in
my
carriage
and
on
the
wings
of
thirst
we
flew
to
the
Piazza
Santi
Apostoli
which
spot
notwithstanding
its
venerated
name
has
amber
medicine
for
sore
throats
The
worthy
Monsignor
hailed
from
the
land
of
the
Czech
a
giant
in
size
with
the
heart
of
a
child
He
related
anecdotes
of
the
Pope
who
was
a
democrat
and
easy
of
access
He
was
musical
proud
of
his
singing
and
played
the
piano
I
asked
Monsignor
if
he
had
ever
heard
Pius
IX
nicknamed
Pia
Nina
by
Cardinal
Antonelli
because
of
his
love
of
music
and
friendship
for
Liszt
Pius
X
did
not
care
for
Liszt
s
religious
music
always
referring
to
the
Hungarian
composer
as
il
compositore
Tedesco
which
would
have
pained
the
Abbe
for
he
was
proud
of
his
nationality
The
Graner
Mass
has
never
been
sung
at
St
Peter
s
although
Liszt
was
so
friendly
with
Pius
IX
I
made
Monsignor
laugh
when
I
retailed
that
venerable
tale
about
Liszt
s
repentance
and
withdrawal
from
the
world
to
the
Oratory
of
the
Madonna
del
Rosario
on
Monte
Mario
an
hour
from
Rome
Pope
Pio
Nono
conferred
upon
the
Magyar
pianist
the
singular
honour
of
personally
hearing
his
con
fession
and
receiving
the
celebrated
sinner
into
the
arms
of
Mother
Church
Perhaps
the
delightful
old
Pope
was
curious
After
the
first
day
and
night
Liszt
was
still
on
his
knees
muttering
into
the
exhausted
ears
of
the
unhappy
Pontiff
the
awful
history
of
his
life
and
loves
Then
extenuated
Pio
Nono
begged
his
penitent
Basta
Caro
Liszt
Your
memory
is
marvellous
Now
go
to
the
piano
and
play
there
the
remainder
of
your
sins
Liszt
did
so
and
for
another
day
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
Vatican
echoed
with
the
most
extraordi
nary
carnal
and
enchanting
music
The
wailing
of
damned
souls
the
blasts
of
hell
and
the
choral
singing
of
cloistered
cats
were
overheard
Liszt
had
never
played
so
intimately
so
epically
Not
only
was
the
spellbound
Pope
shaken
by
the
thunder
of
the
Apoca
lypse
by
the
great
white
throne
and
Lucifer
in
chains
but
he
had
visions
of
the
Mohammedan
Paradise
with
fountains
gazelles
and
quite
worn-out
he
fell
asleep
and
when
he
awoke
the
following
week
Franz
Liszt
was
made
an
Abbe
and
a
deacon
in
third
orders
It
is
said
I
told
Monsignor
Pick
that
he
never
touched
a
key
board
after
that
in
the
Vatican
Se
non
e
vero
e
ben
Trovatore
hummed
the
cleric
And
it
was
my
turn
to
laugh
I
must
not
forget
that
next
day
the
Syrian
ped
dler
descended
upon
our
hotel
with
photographs
for
sale
I
bought
three
copies
one
I
still
possess
Why
not
A
man
doesn
t
often
get
a
chance
to
appear
in
the
same
picture
with
a
Pope
And
I
still
hear
the
summons
Uno
due
tre
of
that
too
familiar
Roman
photog
rapher
ON
THE
TRAIL
OF
THE
EARTHQUAKE
Several
weeks
previous
to
the
interview
with
the
Pope
I
was
living
at
Sorrento
on
the
Bay
of
Naples
Marion
Crawford
the
novelist
in
whose
company
I
crossed
from
New
York
lived
not
far
away
at
Cocuemella
There
I
visited
the
celebrated
author
of
Mr
Isaacs
and
A
Roman
Singer
and
saw
the
tower
in
which
he
wrote
it
stood
on
a
hill
some
distance
from
his
villa
which
overlooked
the
Mediterranean
His
yacht
was
usually
anchored
off
the
Hotel
Vittoria
and
daily
I
swam
out
and
around
it
Not
till
later
did
I
dis
cover
that
it
had
served
as
a
New
York
harbour
pilot
boat
owned
by
Pilot
Brown
the
father
of
the
young
pastor
Father
George
Brown
of
Morristown
N
Y
But
the
craft
had
an
Italian
crew
it
was
no
wonder
I
didn
t
recognise
its
American
origin
The
summer
of
1905
was
a
hot
sultry
one
in
Southern
Italy
Mount
Vesuvius
in
eruption
through
August
and
September
was
a
magnif
icent
spectacle
from
the
esplanade
of
the
Vittoria
at
Sorrento
In
the
daytime
the
crater
lost
its
infernal
lustre
yet
it
glistened
at
night
lava
streamed
down
the
mountainside
No
one
seemed
nervous
in
Naples
Nor
for
that
matter
at
Torre
del
Greco
in
the
direct
path
of
the
molten
river
But
the
most
enchanting
spectacle
was
after
sunset
when
the
black
column
of
smoke
ex
panded
at
the
top
like
the
palm-tree
the
classic
shape
de
scribed
by
Pliny
became
a
tremendous
pillar
of
fire
showering
sparks
and
huge
incandescent
masses
over
the
landscape
The
booming
as
of
distant
artillery
was
incessant
and
it
became
so
alarming
that
I
asked
the
porter
of
the
hotel
if
danger
was
to
be
expected
Being
an
expert
liar
he
answered
that
every
summer
Mount
Vesuvius
shot
its
fireworks
for
the
benefit
of
foreign
visitors
and
that
the
principal
noise
I
heard
was
merely
the
gun
practice
of
an
Italian
navy
fleet
anchored
off
Castellamare
Now
as
several
oldest
inhabitants
in
Naples
had
informed
me
that
such
an
eruption
was
a
novelty
they
carried
open
umbrellas
in
the
streets
when
pulverised
dust
or
ashes
became
too
thick
I
knew
I
was
enjoying
a
rare
and
operatic
performance
conducted
by
impresario
nature
Auber
s
Masaniello
and
its
erup
tion
scene
was
childish
in
comparison
but
Bulwer
s
de
scription
in
The
Last
Days
of
Pompeii
struck
the
right
keynote
The
grand
finale
was
to
follow
I
had
been
in
Naples
all
day
and
a
muggy
day
it
was
I
had
taken
luncheon
at
the
Gambrinus
a
pleasant
cafe
on
the
water
s
edge
kept
by
a
fat
Italian
He
had
smiled
when
I
expressed
my
astonishment
at
the
unconcern
of
the
Neapolitans
They
were
used
to
the
caprices
of
their
beloved
mountain
Even
the
inhabitants
at
its
base
returned
to
their
devastated
farms
and
calmly
re
sumed
work
after
an
outburst
I
took
the
afternoon
boat
to
Capri
which
stops
at
Sorrento
and
as
I
saw
the
gorgeous
pyrotechnics
from
the
upper
deck
I
congratu
lated
myself
on
my
luck
People
have
gone
to
Naples
for
years
yet
missed
a
real
Vesuvian
blow-up
The
next
morning
I
saw
with
some
surprise
that
plaster
had
fallen
from
my
ceiling
A
storm
during
the
night
no
doubt
But
when
I
went
to
the
portier
s
lodge
for
my
mail
I
found
a
mob
surrounding
the
poor
man
whose
wits
had
deserted
him
He
could
only
ejaculate
very
bad
very
bad
and
it
took
me
ten
minutes
to
pluck
out
the
heart
of
his
mystery
and
then
he
pointed
in
the
direction
of
Naples
I
eagerly
looked
To
my
aston
ishment
Vesuvius
was
normal
A
hazy
cloud
of
vapour
issued
from
its
centre
the
metallic
booming
had
ceased
I
was
mystified
I
had
seen
Mount
Etna
in
Sicily
and
Mount
Stromboli
on
the
Lipari
Islands
and
it
was
thus
they
had
appeared
although
the
lighthouse
of
the
Medi
terranean
was
luminous
after
dark
Very
bad
re
peated
the
portier
Batuishka
I
said
firmly
grasp
ing
him
by
the
neck
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
he
was
a
Russian
Beloved
brother
speak
make
yourself
clear
or
by
the
holy
name
of
Rurik
PII
choke
the
beloved
son
of
your
venerated
mother
He
spoke
It
was
very
bad
indeed
At
about
three
A
M
a
shock
had
started
from
the
fiery
mountain
traversed
the
country
and
de
veloped
into
a
frightful
earthquake
in
Calabria
near
Reggio
the
eruption
stopped
as
the
quake
began
Vesuvius
had
shot
its
bolt
In
the
cataclysm
which
oc
curred
several
years
afterwards
Reggio
was
destroyed
catastrophe
was
severe
enough
It
had
lightly
shaken
Sorrento
and
the
household
climbed
down
the
steep
in
cline
or
went
on
the
lift
to
the
strand
where
they
prayed
and
screamed
till
daylight
My
neighbour
in
the
next
room
had
been
thrown
violently
from
his
bed
I
had
peacefully
slept
The
portier
regarded
me
with
suspicious
cynical
eyes
What
A
man
could
sleep
through
such
a
shock
Oh
those
Americans
Then
he
winked
at
me
with
the
sly
wink
of
a
little
Russian
Ah
yes
the
foreign-born
Barin
had
been
over
the
gulf
at
Naples
No
wonder
he
slept
soundly
But
I
was
too
busy
getting
my
kit
ready
and
scouring
Sorrento
for
a
conveyance
to
take
me
to
Calabria
There
was
a
fat
newspaper
story
down
there
and
I
didn
t
propose
to
miss
it
The
King
and
Queen
of
Italy
had
motored
from
Rome
that
morning
at
last
I
hired
a
miserable
old
machine
and
a
gay
young
chauffeur
To
the
Evvivas
of
the
hotel
guests
led
by
the
portier
now
quite
overseas
from
excitement
and
a
subtly
dangerous
liqueur
called
Strega
I
went
off
on
the
job
though
with
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
we
should
smash
up
before
we
reached
Amalfi
We
did
Worst
of
all
was
the
be
haviour
of
the
driver
He
was
a
thirsty
soul
and
insisted
on
pointing
out
every
trattoria
on
the
route
He
drank
but
kept
sober
What
I
particularly
disliked
was
his
hospitable
way
of
inviting
a
friend
at
each
wine
house
to
ride
and
keep
him
company
Those
friends
of
his
sat
on
the
front
of
the
car
and
to
have
some
dirty
rascal
blot
out
the
view
and
let
me
enjoy
his
evil
odour
no
it
was
too
much
Halt
I
finally
cried
after
we
had
dropped
a
woman
with
a
dirty
brat
at
a
wayside
inn
halt
Antonio
I
hired
this
motor
I
continued
and
you
are
renting
the
front
seats
to
every
newcomer
It
must
stop
subito
I
explained
and
added
caramba
and
then
remembered
that
it
was
not
Italian
I
ll
get
out
if
you
take
on
another
passenger
He
smiled
showing
ivory
that
an
elephant
might
have
envied
My
threat
didn
t
disturb
this
ingenuous
youth
He
knew
So
did
I
The
road
was
hilly
dusty
and
perhaps
dangerous
But
when
I
told
him
that
he
would
not
receive
a
tip
he
weakened
and
promised
to
be
good
We
proceeded
on
our
winding
way
Nevertheless
we
reached
our
desti
nation
two
days
late
but
I
saw
the
desolated
villages
saw
the
misery
which
those
truly
charitable
souls
the
royal
pair
did
so
much
to
relieve
and
saw
the
little
girl
with
her
nanny-goat
who
was
rescued
after
being
penned
up
in
the
ruins
of
her
house
The
continuous
bleating
of
the
kid
and
her
feeble
wails
led
to
their
discovery
When
covered
with
dirt
she
came
blinking
into
the
daylight
her
arm
about
that
blessed
goat
she
cooed
Babbo
Babbo
Her
mother
had
died
before
she
was
old
enough
to
remember
the
loss
so
there
was
no
one
but
Babbo
left
and
he
was
buried
under
the
debris
in
his
cellar
The
child
was
pacified
with
candy
and
the
last
I
saw
of
her
and
the
goat
was
as
she
stood
talking
to
the
Queen
who
was
alternately
weeping
and
laughing
She
is
a
stranger
born
the
Queen
but
the
Italians
adore
her
because
of
such
pity
for
the
afflicted
I
had
seen
the
havoc
wrought
by
the
earthquake
after
sleeping
through
its
primal
shock
I
TREAT
A
KING
I
have
mentioned
the
name
of
Milan
of
Servia
In
unworthy
descendant
of
the
Obrenovitches
originally
O
Brians
of
Antrim
I
could
take
an
oath
Swineherds
and
Servian
Kings
One
torrid
August
afternoon
I
was
writing
at
the
Cafe
Monferino
Paris
where
I
did
much
of
my
work
I
tried
to
be
very
Parisian
then
A
furious
gabbling
at
the
table
next
to
me
caused
me
to
curse
the
interruption
A
dark
wiry
chap
was
quarrelling
with
a
fat
swarthy
whiskered
personage
in
an
unfamiliar
speech
They
became
so
noisy
that
I
protested
using
I
am
sorry
to
say
violent
language
But
they
paid
no
attention
It
was
evidently
a
dispute
over
money
for
they
held
up
fingers
counted
in
the
air
and
took
out
wallets
I
summoned
the
proprietor
He
whispered
Cher
ami
it
is
the
Milan
King
of
Servia
and
with
him
is
his
ex-Prime-Minister
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Chamberlain
First
Lord
of
the
Bedchamber
and
Bot
tle
holder
This
fact
altered
matters
Ten
minutes
elapsed
and
I
found
myself
sitting
with
the
royal
house
hold
and
interviewing
the
King
He
was
a
charming
blackguard
His
first
question
was
Do
you
already
know
the
families
Vanderbilt
Astor
and
Rockefeller
My
son
would
like
to
make
a
rich
alliance
He
is
King
of
Servia
His
mother
Queen
Natalie
Milan
had
the
impudence
to
mention
the
name
of
that
sainted
and
cruelly
abused
woman
will
be
happy
if
he
marries
an
American
I
thanked
him
for
the
honour
and
confessed
that
while
I
was
not
precisely
hand
in
glove
with
the
people
he
mentioned
But
I
will
make
it
worth
your
while
young
man
he
importuned
I
am
not
a
business
man
much
less
a
Shatchen
a
marriage-broker
as
they
say
in
Yiddish
yet
I
found
something
so
comic
about
this
diplomatic
offer
that
I
burst
out
laughing
The
royal
household
took
umbrage
I
apologised
In
the
mean
time
the
sun
had
vanished
behind
the
opera-house
and
we
went
out
on
the
terrace
The
household
could
boast
a
thirst
They
swallowed
vast
doubles
of
Pilsner
and
soon
the
porcelain
stands
which
also
serve
as
tallies
began
to
pile
up
At
midnight
we
were
still
discussing
the
tremendous
question
Would
a
female
member
of
the
prominent
American
families
aforesaid
be
induced
to
wed
the
scion
of
the
Obrenovitches
If
so
how
much
By
this
time
I
could
only
see
their
faces
so
high
were
piled
the
tallies
Parisian
waiters
easily
forget
and
this
is
a
safe
method
for
keeping
the
account
before
your
eyes
I
went
indoors
to
select
some
cigars
When
I
came
out
no
royal
household
was
to
be
seen
I
made
in
quiries
in
a
sad
voice
Arcades
ambo
I
said
and
con
soled
myself
with
the
thought
that
the
story
I
had
ex
tracted
from
them
would
amply
repay
me
for
the
out
lay
I
asked
the
garcon
for
his
addition
At
fourteen
cents
a
double
and
with
about
one
hundred
doubles
to
be
reckoned
up
in
less
excited
condition
I
volun
tarily
knocked
off
one-half
of
this
number
I
saw
that
there
would
be
no
excess
profits
left
from
the
article
And
so
it
came
to
pass
I
paid
the
bill
and
when
I
met
the
same
scamps
a
few
evenings
later
I
told
them
what
we
do
to
such
pikers
in
the
land
of
the
free
They
shrugged
indifferent
shoulders
explaining
that
I
had
in
vited
them
besides
I
was
only
a
correspondent
an
American
and
because
of
the
honour
conferred
by
their
company
I
moved
away
The
poor
son
of
a
poor
father
married
Draga
and
made
her
his
queen
and
with
her
was
foully
murdered
in
1903
Peter
Karageorgovich
the
legitimate
King
did
not
know
of
the
conspiring
that
put
him
back
on
the
throne
yet
he
was
clairvoyant
enough
to
reach
Belgrade
from
Paris
in
surprisingly
short
time
HOME
AGAIN
I
returned
to
Philadelphia
I
loved
Paris
but
my
parents
loved
me
more
There
was
no
fatted
calf
killed
on
my
arrival
I
came
over
on
the
Red
Star
line
and
my
last
bright
memory
was
Antwerp
and
a
September
Ker
messe
I
was
despondent
when
I
went
aboard
the
steamer
and
didn
t
dream
that
Bruges
Antwerp
Brussels
would
see
me
years
afterwards
as
a
regular
summer
in
habitant
My
home
city
was
shrunken
Paris
is
a
dangerous
criterion
It
was
the
only
criterion
I
had
at
the
time
If
I
had
come
via
Brooklyn
the
modulation
would
have
been
less
painful
If
I
had
landed
at
New
York
instead
of
on
the
Delaware
I
should
never
have
gone
further
Of
that
I
am
sure
Why
the
sudden
dis
taste
for
Philadelphia
The
only
answer
is
Paris
That
magic
vocable
filled
my
horizon
I
was
more
hope
lessly
homesick
for
the
city
than
before
I
saw
it
But
why
explain
I
came
to
consciousness
as
painfully
as
the
moment
when
the
balsam
apple
liniment
burned
into
my
flesh
after
my
accident
at
the
Baldwin
locomotive
shop
My
family
behaved
beautifully
Not
a
reproach
but
my
friends
were
uncomfortable
when
they
met
me
I
was
like
a
man
who
is
reported
missing
in
an
accident
and
is
mentally
disposed
of
by
his
acquaintances
and
then
embarrasses
them
by
appearing
safe
and
sound
I
should
have
stayed
away
longer
The
prodigal
son
is
always
a
bore
I
went
about
my
business
as
usual
but
teaching
no
longer
appealed
to
me
A
foreign
corre
spondent
and
a
piano
teacher
I
moped
I
studied
in
fact
for
several
years
read
enormously
A
few
cultured
families
opened
their
doors
to
me
I
saw
that
one
could
live
in
Philadelphia
and
yet
enjoy
art
and
literature
With
Franz
Schubert
I
resumed
the
old-music-making
Max
Heinrich
and
his
brood
had
gone
South
I
met
Theodore
Presser
and
we
persuaded
ourselves
that
we
must
have
the
superciliary
tendon
of
the
ring-finger
on
the
left
hand
liberated
by
cutting
Pianists
are
ham
pered
by
this
tendon
one
of
those
survivals
in
the
human
anatomy
like
the
appendix
the
pineal
gland
and
moral
scruples
Bravely
we
went
arm
in
arm
to
Dr
Forbes
a
well-known
surgeon
then
on
Locust
Street
west
of
Broad
We
took
our
punishment
without
complaint
or
cocaine
The
little
snip
of
the
steel
hurt
but
that
night
I
played
as
usual
at
an
exposition
in
West
Philadelphia
where
my
old
employer
William
Dalliba
Dutton
had
an
exhibition
of
pianos
I
think
I
should
have
accepted
an
invitation
to
a
lunar
voyage
so
weary
was
I
of
my
life
I
suffered
from
the
ordinary
hypersesthesia
familiar
to
neurologists
Paris
I
believed
was
my
patrie
phy
sique
and
I
said
so
much
to
the
disgust
of
sensible
people
In
my
revolt
against
my
environment
I
even
went
so
far
as
to
plan
a
society
for
the
aesthetic
and
moral
regeneration
of
society
It
was
to
be
called
The
Chil
dren
of
Adam
after
the
chastest
and
most
odouriferous
section
of
Wicked
Walt
s
Leaves
of
Grass
I
drafted
the
formula
of
the
scheme
It
was
comprehensive
and
pagan
enough
to
have
aroused
even
the
interest
of
the
police
if
known
I
found
some
disciples
intellectual
artistic
girls
who
saw
the
ideal
through
a
hole
in
the
millstone
There
were
plenty
of
windmills
in
the
vicinity
but
this
particular
group
didn
t
wear
bonnets
so
nothing
came
of
the
enterprise
It
languished
and
died
of
inani
tion
The
chief
trouble
lay
in
the
fact
that
I
was
to
be
grand
Panjandrum
Pooh-Pah
and
Brigham
Young
com
bined
No
other
males
but
I
were
admitted
to
member
ship
In
such
circumstances
The
Children
of
Adam
could
not
have
long
endured
Nor
I
It
was
the
ideal
of
a
happy
chicken-coop
The
consolation
I
had
after
a
week
of
study
was
the
long
walk
on
Saturday
afternoon
in
company
with
Professor
Roth
Dr
E
J
Nolan
and
Frank
Cunningham
The
professor
as
my
friend
and
only
schoolmaster
felt
called
upon
to
exercise
from
time
to
time
his
classic
prerogative
of
putting
me
through
my
paces
He
knew
of
my
passion
for
music
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
promenade
he
held
me
up
on
the
river
just
where
the
boathouses
stand
James
he
asked
snapping
his
thumbs
and
forefingers
an
ominous
sign
that
made
me
shiver
emancipated
as
I
was
from
the
schoolroom
James
man
what
is
rhythm
The
finger
snapping
increased
sure
sign
of
repressed
impa
tience
Bravely
I
stuck
to
my
definition
Professor
Roth
the
simplest
formula
is
measured
flow
Rhythm
derives
from
the
Greek
He
interrupted
Greek
or
no
Greek
Thunder
and
mud
For
the
last
time
what
is
rhythm
James
Dr
Nolan
and
Frank
showed
anxious
interest
But
I
was
not
to
be
shaken
Mea
sured
flow
that
s
what
rhythm
is
when
we
get
to
Straw
berry
Mansion
Professor
I
ll
prove
to
you
that
rhythm
can
also
become
measured
flow
I
winked
The
professor
cordially
shook
my
hand
The
others
laughed
and
I
felt
relieved
I
knew
his
puzzling
tactics
At
the
most
inopportune
moments
he
would
pop
out
questions
to
rattle
his
old
pupils
not
even
the
presence
of
a
bishop
could
prevent
from
asking
What
is
the
origin
of
the
mitre
or
If
there
are
four
synoptic
gospels
how
many
rejected
gospels
were
there
Which
was
embarrassing
Edward
Roth
withal
crochety
had
a
very
human
disposition
and
his
old
pupils
are
faithful
to
his
memory
When
they
meet
he
is
the
first
person
they
discuss
Our
walks
seldom
varied
We
would
meet
at
the
Academy
of
Natural
Sciences
proceed
up
Twentieth
Street
occasionally
cut
into
Pennsylvania
Avenue
but
usually
followed
Fairmount
Avenue
to
the
park
entrance
thence
along
the
west
drive
and
sauntering
chatting
smoking
we
enjoyed
the
loveliest
natural
park
of
them
all
Strawberry
Mansion
achieved
we
halted
Levy
would
play
on
his
golden
cornet
he
had
a
French
horn
tone
this
plump
little
Jew
born
in
Dublin
and
we
sat
at
table
and
didn
t
eat
strawberries
I
think
that
Rob
ert
Tagg
of
Maennerchor
Garden
was
the
manager
of
the
cafe
The
park
then
was
not
under
dusty
puritanical
rule
and
I
can
t
for
the
life
of
me
see
any
improvement
in
our
civic
virtues
or
human
thought
and
activities
Roth
was
a
well-read
man
a
linguist
and
a
classical
scholar
Dr
Nolan
strong
on
the
natural
sciences
with
a
bias
towards
modern
literature
possessed
the
wittiest
tongue
in
the
town
He
could
scarify
an
opponent
as
quickly
as
a
farmer
s
wife
can
wring
the
neck
of
a
fowl
Battles
royal
were
fought
between
Nolan
and
Roth
Frank
Cunningham
and
I
anticipated
blood
flowing
but
the
only
thing
that
flowed
was
beer
At
nightfall
we
returned
tired
and
pleased
with
our
outing
There
weren
t
as
many
clubs
as
there
are
nowadays
The
park
was
our
summer
club
The
old-fashioned
hospitality
of
New
Year
s
Day
was
beginning
to
disappear
How
well
I
remembered
the
closed
windows
lights
burning
at
midday
the
punch
bowl
and
the
appearance
of
sundry
young
men
more
or
less
speechless
though
fervently
polite
It
had
its
draw
backs
this
immemorial
custom
but
the
girls
liked
it
The
punch
bowl
has
gone
into
the
limbo
of
discarded
things
and
the
world
wags
on
The
same
good
old
Dr
Landis
lectured
to
men
only
Don
t
be
a
clam
was
an
advertising
slogan
The
Chestnut
Street
Opera
House
was
for
me
the
wickedest
place
on
the
globe
Startling
posters
revealing
stoutly
built
British
Blondes
with
grand-piano
legs
stirred
my
curiosity
whatever
they
were
called
the
Lydia
Thompson
or
the
Emily
Soldene
burlesques
With
the
exception
of
Alice
Dun
ning
Lingard
I
thought
Lisa
Weber
the
most
attractive
woman
on
the
boards
Years
after
I
had
seen
Lydia
I
went
to
Her
Majesty
s
theatre
in
the
Haymarket
Lon
don
then
under
the
direction
of
Beerbohm
Tree
Francis
Neilson
was
stage
manager
and
Twelfth
Night
was
truly
a
gorgeous
revival
Tree
played
Malvolio
one
of
his
most
convincing
assumptions
for
despite
his
much
praised
versatility
his
range
was
extremely
limited
I
sat
in
the
front
row
a
guest
of
the
management
and
next
to
a
very
old
but
active
lady
who
took
the
greatest
in
terest
in
the
performance
The
Maria
was
Miss
Til
bury
Zeffie
and
she
was
so
arch
and
charming
that
we
applauded
her
Simply
beaming
with
joy
my
neigh
bour
asked
She
is
very
good
is
she
not
sir
I
praised
the
girl
She
is
my
daughter
she
proudly
informed
me
The
entr
acte
found
me
behind
with
Neilson
He
smiled
Do
you
know
the
lady
next
to
you
Yes
Miss
Tilbury
s
mother
she
told
me
so
True
replied
Frank
but
do
you
realise
that
she
is
Lydia
Thompson
Good
Lord
The
years
at
once
telescoped
and
I
saw
the
handsome
blonde
Lydia
of
my
boyhood
now
a
little
old
lady
still
interested
in
the
stage
and
in
her
daughter
s
career
At
a
little
midnight
supper
I
related
to
my
host
Beerbohm
not
then
Sir
Herbert
Tree
the
story
and
he
told
me
a
dozen
better
ones
To
Neilson
and
myself
he
said
They
say
the
Beerbohms
have
Jewish
blood
True
I
was
born
in
Berlin
and
my
father
Julius
Birn
baum
was
a
Russian
but
if
I
had
a
few
drops
of
what
George
du
Maurier
called
the
precious
essence
I
should
be
a
richer
man
Tree
made
money
but
spent
it
in
costly
production
He
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
Henry
Irving
His
Darling
of
the
Gods
was
almost
as
elaborate
as
David
Belasco
s
I
thought
of
a
possible
Jewish
strain
in
the
family
when
I
was
with
George
Moore
on
the
esplanade
of
the
Baireuth
Opera
House
in
1901
We
had
been
speaking
of
humour
and
I
spoke
of
Jewish
humour
What
do
you
call
Jewish
humour
said
Mr
Moore
in
his
most
disinterested
manner
I
re
plied
Heine
Saphir
Beaconsfield
Zangwill
Max
Beerbohm
I
didn
t
know
that
Max
was
a
Jew
exclaimed
the
novelist
Max
is
a
half-brother
of
Her
bert
He
may
not
be
Jewish
but
he
has
that
deli
cate
ironic
touch
which
is
Hebraic
It
abounds
in
Hebraic
literature
Then
the
trumpets
from
their
bal
cony
sounded
the
fate-motive
and
we
all
trooped
in
to
the
last
act
of
The
Valkyries
You
can
t
always
tell
from
physiognomy
Sitting
one
afternoon
on
the
beautiful
Marina
at
Naples
after
visit
ing
the
devil-fish
and
other
extraordinary
sea-monsters
in
the
Aquarium
perhaps
the
choicest
collection
in
exist
ence
I
was
surrounded
by
a
lot
of
little
beggar
boys
Half
dressed
dirty
impudent
and
several
of
them
as
beautiful
as
the
Infant
Jesus
I
saw
that
it
was
a
hopeless
hold-up
I
shook
my
stick
at
them
Some
ran
away
I
looked
about
me
for
the
police
not
one
in
view
it
was
the
hour
of
the
siesta
Clear
out
you
scamps
I
threatened
The
leader
of
the
gang
must
have
been
twelve
years
old
He
never
budged
though
he
kept
beyond
the
reach
of
my
stout
cherrywood
stick
He
remonstrated
and
did
my
ears
play
a
trick
New
York
East
Side
English
What
for
you
rich
Yankee
come
to
Napoli
and
no
give
money
to
poor
Italian
boy
That
settled
it
Here
I
cried
giving
him
a
handful
of
copper
Where
did
you
learn
English
I
came
from
New
York
I
was
born
there
Born
where
Mulberry
Street
he
answered
and
with
his
band
scooted
towards
the
Santa
Lucia
quarter
He
looked
like
the
future
chief
of
a
black-hand
blackmailing
organisa
tion
Then
Naples
was
in
the
temporary
clutches
of
the
notorious
Camorra
who
made
themselves
very
un
popular
with
visitors
Rich
man
the
boy
had
said
and
at
the
very
moment
I
was
counting
my
wealth
to
see
if
I
had
enough
to
get
as
far
as
Genoa
if
not
I
should
be
compelled
to
ship
at
Naples
on
my
return-trip
ticketo
ETERNITY
AND
THE
TOWN
PUMP
Let
us
rest
now
for
a
little
gossip
about
Eternity
and
the
Town
Pump
I
pause
to
recover
my
second
wind
I
ve
told
you
some
things
I
remember
about
Old
Phila
delphia
and
the
Paris
of
the
seventies
and
eighties
there
fore
it
might
be
a
holy
and
wholesome
thought
to
catch
my
breath
and
incidentally
examine
my
conscience
I
warned
you
at
the
beginning
of
these
papers
that
I
pro
posed
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
everything
of
course
I
wouldn
t
dare
all
for
fear
the
police
would
intervene
else
how
can
you
judge
my
estimates
of
music
painting
acting
literature
Out
of
the
hodge-podge
which
I
call
my
life
I
had
to
distill
some
sort
of
philosophy
I
was
never
an
agnostic
I
always
believed
in
something
somewhere
somewhen
as
Emerson
has
it
In
fact
I
believe
and
still
believe
in
everything
I
am
a
Yes
Say
er
to
life
Any
extravagance
but
the
denial
of
reality
The
vicar
of
hell
is
he
who
teaches
the
nega
tion
of
things
Man
is
a
vertical
animal
True
But
he
is
also
mobile
an
animal
that
adapts
Because
of
his
numerous
aptitudes
he
is
differentiated
from
his
fellow
animals
His
fall
was
when
he
went
on
all-fours
and
worshipped
ignoble
sticks
and
stones
as
gods
The
ges
ture
was
well-meant
but
the
attitude
undignified
It
was
a
throwback
to
the
anthropoids
It
savoured
of
a
return
to
animalism
Yet
it
is
better
to
be
a
polytheist
than
an
atheist
The
gods
are
ever
moving
through
the
heavens
to
remoter
constellations
Nothing
endures
but
mobility
changeless
change
Nevertheless
we
speak
of
stability
permanence
immortality
the
absolute
when
nature
abhors
an
absolute
The
Eternal
Return
is
now
it
is
the
eternal
recommencement
Hope
of
a
future
life
is
the
aura
thrown
off
by
young
healthy
cellular
tissue
The
sap
is
mounting
Youth
alone
is
immortal
With
advancing
decay
the
fires
of
the
future
pale
and
burn
out
But
we
must
believe
the
very
affirmation
of
belief
say
in
free-will
puts
courage
into
actions
Words
worth
in
his
famous
sonnet
after
deploring
that
the
world
is
too
much
with
us
late
and
soon
getting
and
spending
we
lay
waste
our
powers
exclaims
with
noble
indignation
Great
God
I
d
rather
be
a
pagan
suckled
in
a
creed
outworn
Then
he
could
believe
in
old
Triton
and
all
the
gods
of
the
waters
Plato
called
Time
a
moving
image
of
eternity
be
lieving
that
God
was
unable
to
make
the
earth
eternal
To
each
man
his
mysticism
Everything
that
is
to
be
has
already
happened
the
tiny
segment
of
the
curve
of
events
we
call
the
Present
is
not
the
best
vantage
point
from
which
to
grasp
the
mighty
wheel
of
life
Even
the
norm
of
our
existence
may
not
have
been
the
norm
of
remotest
ages
past
As
Ibsen
said
perhaps
two
and
two
make
five
on
the
planet
Jupiter
Our
reason
is
the
crystallisation
of
ancient
experiences
The
constancy
of
the
human
intellect
proclaimed
by
Remy
de
Gourmont
may
be
one
more
metaphysical
illusion
Historical
per
spective
is
too
limited
to
permit
any
but
vague
general
isations
As
for
fatalism
what
else
are
those
who
write
and
speak
of
Free-Will
Immanence
of
the
Deity
but
fatalists
If
the
exterior
world
is
a
mirage
of
our
inner
self
then
the
lack
of
continuity
the
fragmentary
attempts
the
disjoined
thinking
without
sequence
or
import
are
not
all
these
things
natural
for
the
reason
that
they
are
The
queer
being
that
peers
at
us
over
the
back
wall
of
our
consciousness
our
phantom
twin
our
true
self
the
wanderer
and
his
shadow
the
old
man
of
the
sea
Sinbad
s
unwelcome
burden
our
sublimal
consciousness
as
the
psychoanalysts
call
it
what
is
this
mocking
devil
doing
there
sneering
at
our
pretenses
and
laughing
when
we
fall
and
skin
our
mean
little

Is
he
Brother
Death
We
carry
this
companion
from
the
cradle
to
the
coffin
We
appease
him
with
our
heart
s
blood
and
with
our
flimsy
lies
and
sometimes
succeed
in
stifling
his
importu
nate
and
accusing
voice
What
if
the
neighbours
should
hear
him
scolding
in
the
reaches
of
the
night
What
a
scandal
that
would
be
Most
men
and
women
die
disappointed
with
life
which
they
think
has
played
them
a
scurvy
trick
And
it
has
Its
chief
function
is
to
illude
and
then
dis
appoint
our
false
hopes
The
majority
of
humans
die
of
spiritual
arterio-sclerosis
the
result
of
a
too
high
blood
pressure
caused
by
vain
imaginings
Your
doctor
detects
the
danger
with
his
sphygmograph
your
spiritual
director
also
employs
his
sphygmograph
examination
of
the
conscience
It
is
often
efficacious
The
chief
thing
it
shows
you
is
that
life
at
first
a
feast
planned
by
the
almighty
Barmecide
host
proves
to
be
a
succession
of
appearances
his
guests
never
taste
essences
only
yearn
for
them
from
afar
Our
five
senses
play
the
immortal
game
to
perfection
The
efferent
nerves
carry
from
our
centre
a
filament
message
to
the
exterior
our
afferent
nerves
return
to
us
the
message
of
the
world
without
Literally
we
are
imprisoned
for
life
with
the
privilege
of
telephoning
our
cerebral
central
to
ask
it
to
phone
us
the
news
of
outer
existence
It
s
the
greatest
fairy-tale
imaginable
our
life
But
it
is
not
free
oh
no
In
a
physical
sense
we
are
the
grandchildren
of
vegetables
which
live
by
solar
heat
and
of
the
so-called
lower
ani
mals
query
why
lower
Like
them
we
too
are
au
tomatons
ruled
by
the
same
rigid
laws
we
borrow
vitality
from
the
vegetable
kingdom
and
we
are
nourished
by
this
triple-distilled
solar
energy
Nature
is
not
always
coherent
and
De
Vries
the
Dutch
scientist
showed
me
when
I
visited
his
garden
at
Amsterdam
in
1912
that
nature
can
create
by
leaps
as
well
as
by
orderly
prog
ress
This
philosopher-physicist
actually
produced
new
species
of
flowers
overnight
Our
nervous
system
is
the
whole
animal
And
these
nerves
may
be
so
finely
spun
that
they
receive

from
the
Fourth

of

Life
asserts
Bergson
is
a
division
a
dissocia
tion
not
association
not
an
addition
of
elements
And
at
the
end
the
philosopher
knows
as
much
as
the
peas
ant
But
the
philosopher
doesn
t
believe
this
Personal
liberty
is
another
chimera
To
be
sure
man
is
born
with
a
skin
not
with
a
carapace
like
a
tortoise
nor
is
he
unwieldy
like
the
elephant
He
is
the
lord
of
the
soil
only
for
a
certain
period
Napoleon
the
super
man
of
modern
times
remarked
Liberty
is
the
neces
sity
of
a
small
and
privileged
class
endowed
by
nature
with
faculties
higher
than
those
of
the
mass
of
mankind
it
may
therefore
be
abridged
with
impunity
Equality
on
the
contrary
pleases
the
multitude
He
practised
what
he
preached
Of
fraternity
he
said
nothing
prob
ably
because
there
is
nothing
to
say
even
if
you
call
it
by
such
a
high-sounding
name
as
altruism
It
is
like
one
of
those
ornamental
banners
that
hang
out
in
fine
weather
but
when
it
rains
it
is
quickly
folded
and
brought
indoors
And
it
usually
rains
in
the
land
of
fraternity
I
began
my
dark
saying
on
the
harp
and
I
fear
it
is
ending
in
obscurity
What
am
I
trying
to
prove
Nothing
In
life
nothing
can
be
proved
except
dis
illusion
and
that
may
be
escaped
by
self-study
as
does
an
entomologist
a
formidable
bug
and
by
the
same
token
anything
may
be
proved
even
the
victory
of
Zeno
s
tortoise
over
the
swifter-paced
Achilles
The
sea
lives
without
the
approval
of
man
collaborating
only
with
the
winds
But
we
live
by
a
parallel
of
our
sensa
tions
so
we
worry
if
the
tide
and
weather
are
not
pro
pitious
Hence
the
priest
hence
the
ruler
in
the
scheme
of
civilisation
Voltaire
was
short-sighted
when
he
said
that
mankind
would
not
be
free
until
the
last
king
was
strangled
by
the
bowels
of
the
last
priest
Religion
and
government
were
not
invented
by
priests
and
kings
to
enslave
us
Our
organic
needs
evolved
them
What
a
cosmical
joke
it
would
be
if
after
the
inhabitants
of
this
planet
had
forsaken
all
gods
one
really
existed
a
god
of
irony
smiling
within
the
walls
of
some
unknown
dimen
sion
the
Nth
of
mystic
mathematicians
a
Moloch
of
the
ether
spying
his
hour
to
drop
as
drops
a
boa-constrictor
from
a
tree
upon
deluded
mankind
Perhaps
suspect
ing
some
such
celestial
denouement
Pascal
made
his
wager
with
himself
the
celebrated
pari
de
Pascal
in
which
he
demonstrated
himself
a
more
subtle
Jesuit
than
the
Order
of
Jesus
he
so
denounced
in
his
cruel
brilliant
Provincial
Letters
His
bet
was
a
bit
of
theological
sophistication
If
he
said
you
make
your
peace
with
God
before
you
die
you
are
on
the
safe
side
whether
there
is
a
paradise
or
not
Pascal
a
master
of
the
iron
certitudes
of
geometry
and
the
higher
spatial
dimen
sions
has
always
been
to
me
a
giant
intellect
that
could
believe
and
disbelieve
with
equal
ease
There
are
such
anomalies
in
the
fauna
and
flora
of
the
human
soul
PART
III
NEW
YORK
1877-1917
I
CAPTURE
THE
CITY
I
was
forced
to
drain
my
dree
My
sudden
little
enthusiasms
were
beginning
to
pall
Stung
by
the
gad
fly
of
necessity
I
had
to
follow
my
market
all
news
paper
men
must
I
was
to
learn
that
versatility
is
not
heaven
sent
but
is
largely
a
matter
of
elbow-grease
Some
one
has
written
that
genius
is
mainly
an
affair
of
energy
which
puts
the
blacksmith
Theodore
Roosevelt
and
the
baseball
player
in
the
same
category
If
it
were
only
so
then
the
man
of
genius
would
rub
elbows
with
mediocrity
I
have
always
had
the
courage
of
my
friendships
Not
to
envy
some
particular
person
for
his
accomplishments
is
to
proclaim
yourself
hopelessly
self-satisfied
nevertheless
I
ve
never
met
anyone
with
whom
I
would
change
places
except
a
dead
man
You
may
have
the
desire
of
the
moth
for
the
star
and
remain
a
happy
insect
It
demands
something
more
than
tech
nical
heroism
to
write
your
autobiography
The
life
of
Samuel
Johnson
that
ranks
its
author
among
the
greatest
of
the
world
s
biographers
canny
James
Boswell
a
por
trait-painter
without
parallel
has
also
presented
us
with
a
self-portrait
that
matches
his
masterly
delineation
of
the
great
Cham
Who
reads
Rasselas
nowadays
or
consults
the
once
celebrated
dictionary
I
confess
to
liking
the
Tour
to
the
Hebrides
by
this
most
perfect
of
John
Bulls
But
BoswelPs
Johnson
After
all
auto
biography
is
superior
fiction
Nietzsche
has
warned
us
against
accepting
the
confessions
of
great
men
meaning
Wagner
Writing
one
s
history
is
a
transposition
of
the
embalmer
s
art
to
the
printed
page
Like
the
Egyp
tians
we
seek
to
preserve
our
personality
The
Egyptian
way
has
lasted
longer
We
think
of
the
mighty
Milton
when
he
modestly
confessed
For
although
a
poet
soar
ing
in
the
high
reason
of
his
fancies
with
his
garland
and
singing
robes
about
him
might
without
apology
speak
more
of
himself
than
I
mean
to
do
yet
for
me
sitting
here
below
in
the
cool
element
of
prose
a
mortal
among
many
readers
of
no
empyreal
conceit
to
venture
and
divulge
unusual
things
of
myself
I
shall
petition
to
the
gentler
sort
it
may
not
be
envy
to
me
And
leaning
heavily
on
the
illustrious
John
as
must
all
soul
spillers
I
shall
proceed
with
these
avowals
of
a
personal
pronoun
Did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
the
man
who
proposed
remarriage
to
his
divorced
wife
She
was
one
of
the
old
guard
who
sighs
but
never
surrenders
A
skinny
girl
with
guilty
eyes
her
soul
had
become
a
slumbering
forest
But
she
was
faithful
to
her
alimony
There
fore
when
her
husband
became
imprudent
she
calmly
answered
You
always
were
so
impetuous
He
was
one
of
those
men
to
whom
God
has
given
a
forehead
as
Russian
peasants
say
of
the
bald
Her
pent-up
cas
cades
of
tenderness
not
freely
flowing
he
went
away
in
a
huff
and
remarried
his
other
divorced
wife
But
the
first
lady
s
bank-account
knew
no
husband
She
re
mained
single
and
an
alimonist
in
perpetuity
It
was
certainly
the
end
of
an
imperfect
day
The
moral
is
not
afar
to
seek
I
had
been
unfaithful
to
my
birth
place
I
had
hankered
after
the
flesh-pots
of
Paris
These
failing
I
had
returned
to
my
lawful
first
love
I
CAPTURE
THE
CITY
and
discovered
that
she
was
indifferent
to
me
I
deter
mined
on
another
alliance
A
third
attack
of
that
brief
epilepsy
called
love
had
begun
I
was
in
the
doldrums
of
despair
I
might
have
reproached
Philadelphia
as
De
Quincey
did
stony-hearted
step-mother
Oxford
Street
Anywhere
anywhere
out
of
the
town
I
had
not
even
the
consolation
of
those
new
cults
unscientific
unchristian
and
absurd
that
elevate
religion
to
the
dig
nity
of
a
sport
I
dreamed
of
becoming
a
writer
but
I
realised
that
splendour
of
style
without
spiritual
elevation
is
like
a
gewgaw
in
a
pawnbroker
s
window
And
the
sacrifices
one
must
make
are
enormous
A
leading
motive
in
Faust
Renounce
thou
shalt
shalt
renounce
sounded
for
the
first
time
in
the
symphony
of
my
ego
Suddenly
one
night
I
sat
up
in
bed
and
thought
To
morrow
New
York
In
the
morning
I
packed
my
bag
and
slipped
away
on
an
afternoon
train
without
a
godspeed
save
from
one
faithful
soul
I
was
to
take
another
bath
of
multitude
The
month
was
February
the
year
1886
It
was
nearing
dusk
when
from
the
ferry-boat
I
saw
my
new
home
but
unlike
Rastignac
in
Balzac
s
fiction
I
did
not
shake
my
fist
at
the
imposing
city
nor
mutter
A
nous
deux
maintenant
I
never
even
thought
of
that
duel
with
Paris
in
which
no
man
was
ever
victor
I
only
wondered
where
I
should
sleep
I
soon
decided
I
landed
at
Twenty-third
Street
ferry
caught
a
crosstown
car
alighted
at
Broadway
and
walked
down
to
Four
teenth
Street
there
to
get
a
lodging
for
the
night
in
the
old
Morton
House
The
room
cost
one
dollar
the
win
dow
was
on
the
square
and
from
it
I
could
see
the
Ever
ett
House
the
Union
Square
Hotel
and
the
statue
of
Lincoln
That
section
of
the
town
was
to
become
my
happy
hunting-ground
for
over
twenty-five
years
and
New
York
my
home
for
three
decades
with
the
excep
tion
of
excursions
to
Europe
A
new
Avatar
My
brother
Paul
had
warned
that
if
I
became
a
resident
of
Gotham
then
I
should
have
no
place
to
go
to
an
epigram
that
has
since
been
appropriated
without
due
credit
J
y
suis
j
y
reste
said
I
in
the
immortal
phrase
of
Marechal
MacMahon
Besides
after
Paris
the
modu
lation
to
New
York
was
simple
and
no
city
not
even
Philadelphia
is
so
unlike
Paris
as
New
York
I
didn
t
feel
in
the
least
provincial
Paris
had
lent
me
aplomb
had
rubbed
off
my
salad
greenness
Thirty
years
ago
the
sky-line
from
Jersey
City
was
not
so
inspiring
as
it
is
to-day
but
from
the
heights
of
the
Hudson
the
view
was
then
as
now
magnificent
Above
Wall
Street
on
Broadway
and
east
of
it
was
a
congested
business
district
A
few
spires
Trinity
Church
the
Tribune
Building
the
Times
Building
were
conspicuous
objects
from
the
bay
Now
you
search
for
Trinity
between
cliffs
of
marble
while
in
New
Jersey
you
catch
the
golden
gleam
of
the
World
s
dome
The
Wool
worth
Building
among
many
has
distanced
it
in
the
race
skyward
What
a
difference
too
there
was
lower
down
The
Battery
a
clot
of
green
was
surrounded
by
a
few
imposing
buildings
to-day
mere
impediments
for
their
loftier
neighbours
Walt
Whitman
s
Mast
hemmed
Manhatta
had
an
actual
meaning
then
now
Manhattan
is
funnel-encircled
and
in
a
few
years
it
may
be
the
nesting
spot
of
bird-men
You
could
see
churches
then
Here
and
there
a
spire
like
a
sharpened
lead-pencil
protruded
from
the
background
To-day
one
makes
pilgrimages
to
them
through
stony
canyons
The
city
was
torn
up
as
it
had
been
fifty
years
earlier
when
I
CAPTURE
THE
CITY
Dickens
visited
it
as
it
is
in
1919
New
York
thrives
best
amidst
excavations
That
first
night
is
still
vivid
A
February
thaw
had
set
in
The
evening
was
mild
I
sauntered
from
my
hotel
if
not
captain
of
my
soul
anyhow
of
my
slender
purse
Leaving
so
unexpectedly
I
had
not
prepared
for
the
inevitable
I
had
a
few
friends
but
I
preferred
not
troubling
them
It
was
to
be
bareback
riding
for
the
future
But
I
had
to
eat
my
supper
I
had
dined
at
the
unfashionable
hour
of
i
p
M
I
went
straight
to
a
cafe
I
had
been
there
the
previous
summer
It
stood
on
Fourteenth
Street
east
of
Fourth
Avenue
and
faced
Steinway
Hall
a
prime
magnet
for
me
The
cafe
was
kept
by
an
old
couple
the
Lienaus
and
was
the
head
quarters
of
the
musical
aristocracy
The
men
sat
below
stairs
in
the
cafe
and
watched
Mother
Lienau
count
the
cash
or
scold
George
the
fat
bartender
She
called
him
Schorch
and
he
was
simply
a
treasure
an
adipose
angel
of
amiability
To
hear
him
address
the
irritable
old
woman
as
Mamma
was
touching
especially
as
he
al
ways
winked
at
us
when
she
asked
for
a
drink
Up
stairs
was
the
drawing-room
of
the
establishment
and
there
Papa
Lienau
reigned
He
was
as
tall
and
massive
as
his
wife
was
short
and
pudgy
His
rule
was
clement
Not
to
raise
a
row
over
anything
that
was
the
one
law
And
no
one
ever
did
A
room
in
the
rear
held
a
piano
and
from
it
I
have
heard
music
made
by
Joseffy
Friedheim
Mills
Neupert
Sternberg
who
can
do
more
amusing
stunts
on
the
keyboard
than
any
pianist
Ansorge
and
the
herculean
Rosenthal
But
no
one
was
present
when
I
entered
the
cafe
that
evening
and
ordered
a
humble
meal
Later
in
the
evening
I
met
nearly
every
man
that
later
was
to
have
a
finger
in
my
personal
pie
I
took
a
walk
and
got
as
far
as
Liichow
s
a
few
doors
below
There
I
was
introduced
to
Otto
Floersheim
the
editor
of
The
Musical
Courier
Hugh
Craig
introduced
me
Hugh
was
a
cultivated
Englishman
I
had
met
at
the
Keg
on
Broad
Street
I
had
sold
my
first
story
for
five
dollars
to
the
editor
of
the
West
Philadelphia
Telephone
and
I
promptly
spent
the
money
with
that
jolly
chap
whose
name
I
have
forgotten
While
doing
this
in
strolled
Hugh
Craig
and
a
friendship
began
that
ceased
with
his
death
twenty
years
afterwards
Craig
was
that
ideal
person
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
A
university
man
he
was
also
a
man
of
the
world
of
gentle
breeding
and
he
was
never
in
a
hurry
No
newspaper
in
which
he
worked
needed
an
encyclopaedia
He
seemed
to
know
everything
and
could
write
without
preparation
on
any
topic
A
linguist
he
could
speak
no
language
fluently
but
his
own
though
he
could
translate
from
a
dozen
He
always
had
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
and
there
was
a
slight
burr
on
his
speech
which
may
have
argued
a
Scotch
strain
He
was
a
good
friend
and
like
Sam
Johnson
he
was
ever
ready
for
a
frisk
He
was
of
a
dusty
in
definite
age
about
twenty
years
my
senior
Otto
Floer
sheim
made
no
impression
on
me
except
that
he
was
fat
rather
pompous
good-humoured
and
perspiring
We
went
back
to
Lienau
s
there
to
meet
the
senior
editor
of
The
Musical
Courier
chunky
shrewd
and
with
the
most
piercing
and
brilliant
eyes
I
ever
saw
in
a
human
s
head
They
were
jewelled
gleaming
and
as
hard
as
agate
I
had
met
Marc
Blumenberg
the
summer
of
1885
at
the
Academy
of
Music
New
York
where
a
meeting
of
the
Music
Teachers
National
Association
was
in
session
Theodore
Presser
of
the
Etude
intro
I
CAPTURE
THE
CITY
duced
me
I
had
liked
the
plump
little
Hebrew
and
I
continued
to
like
him
till
the
day
of
his
death
He
it
was
who
gave
me
my
first
leg
up
over
the
fence
in
New
York
and
I
shall
never
forget
his
kindness
We
chatted
I
can
see
him
napkin
tucked
under
his
chin
preparing
to
eat
he
was
a
solid
trencherman
He
took
me
in
with
his
cool
measuring
glance
and
when
I
told
him
that
I
wrote
about
music
he
bade
me
drop
into
the
office
of
The
Musical
Courier
then
at
25
East
Fourteenth
Street
It
was
a
year
or
so
before
I
accepted
that
invitation
What
Craig
and
I
did
that
night
has
slipped
me
The
next
morning
I
was
up
and
doing
for
I
had
slept
well
thanks
to
my
bad
conscience
I
went
in
search
of
a
more
suitable
residence
and
a
cheaper
Jacques
Reich
the
engraver
had
an
atelier
at
Fifth
Avenue
and
Four
teenth
Street
and
to
him
I
explained
my
wants
He
had
lived
in
Philadelphia
and
I
think
did
my
father
s
head
in
crayon
He
proved
obliging
Soon
I
found
a
comfortable
room
top
floor
at
the
corner
of
Thirteenth
Street
and
Seventh
Avenue
In
the
row
of
houses
with
porches
standing
well
away
from
the
sidewalk
on
Seventh
Avenue
is
No
40
The
row
may
be
still
seen
looking
as
it
did
thirty-two
years
ago
Across
the
street
was
the
Fanwood
S
B
Mills
a
famous
pianist
lived
in
the
block
composed
for
the
most
of
boarding-houses
Mrs
Genevieve
Ferris
was
my
landlady
and
the
most
motherly
of
women
She
was
handsome
and
had
a
masterful
way
which
came
natural
as
she
was
a
custom-house
in
spector
and
on
the
steamship
docks
every
day
The
boarders
were
only
five
or
six
young
men
We
paid
eight
dollars
a
week
and
complained
if
we
didn
t
get
beefsteak
at
breakfast
O
the
blessed
time
No
wheat
less
meatless
heatless
sinless
thirstless
days
then
I
io
STEEPLEJACK
shook
down
at
once
in
a
tub
of
butter
But
how
to
put
in
my
time
was
the
problem
At
noon
after
my
belongings
had
been
transferred
and
I
could
look
a
policeman
in
the
eye
feeling
a
home
less
vagabond
no
longer
I
crossed
Fourteenth
Street
to
University
Place
then
to
the
right
and
found
myself
at
the
hospitable
cafe
of
Billy
Moulds
It
should
not
be
forgotten
that
in
New
York
as
in
Paris
the
cafe
is
the
poor
man
s
club
It
is
also
a
rendezvous
for
newspaper
men
musicians
artists
Bohemians
generally
It
is
the
best
stamping-ground
for
men
of
talent
Ideas
circulate
Brain
tilts
with
brain
Eccentricity
must
show
cause
or
be
jostled
If
there
is
too
much
drinking
there
is
the
compensation
of
contiguity
with
interesting
personalities
In
those
abodes
of
prim
dulness
so-called
religious
clubs
for
young
men
without
a
thirst
I
never
saw
any
signs
of
life
except
the
daily
newspapers
I
am
not
concerned
with
the
salvation
of
my
brother
s
soul
having
my
hands
full
of
my
own
but
if
hedging
a
growing
youth
about
with
moral
wire
fences
will
keep
him
straight
then
his
intellectual
growth
is
not
worth
a
copper
At
the
first
puff
of
reality
of
the
world
as
it
actually
is
he
will
collapse
Until
mankind
changes
which
it
hasn
t
since
the
tertiary
geological
epoch
or
something
better
is
de
vised
than
the
cafe
that
institution
will
continue
to
form
and
develop
the
adolescent
male
Clubs
are
too
expen
sive
for
the
majority
of
us
The
present
interlude
of
hypocrisy
and
bigotry
from
which
our
nation
is
now
suffering
will
surely
be
followed
by
a
violent
reaction
and
like
such
reactions
the
pendulum
will
swing
too
far
in
the
opposite
direction
Mankind
can
stand
just
so
much
and
no
more
Recall
the
Restoration
after
the
reign
of
dreary
Puritanism
in
England
and
what
were
the
Puritans
of
those
days
compared
with
our
oppressive
breed
Heaven
bless
their
bones
those
roundheads
consumed
tankards
of
ale
and
plenty
of
beef
Their
worst
offence
was
their
chronic
howling
of
hymns
and
their
forbidding
a
man
to
covet
his
neighbour
s
wife
on
Sundays
also
forbidding
a
man
to
embrace
his
proper
spouse
on
the
Sabbath
an
edict
that
may
have
found
favour
with
overworked
husbands
But
those
Puritans
with
their
scarecrow
sins
were
also
pious
politicians
Beware
a
pious
politician
He
is
more
dangerous
than
one
in
petticoats
sometimes
he
is
in
petticoats
As
to
their
droning
heaven
like
hell
is
paved
with
pious
vocal
intentions
otherwise
how
can
the
choir
angelic
not
to
mention
the
Great
White
Throne
endure
the
ear-splitting
bawling
wafted
upward
from
here
below
Their
deity
must
be
very
patient
or
else
as
tone-deaf
as
his
unmusical
worshippers
Their
sincerity
is
no
excuse
for
sounds
like
a
dog
s
cough
or
the
cackling
of
a
hoarse
parrot
God
can
t
be
worshipped
beautifully
enough
Little
cause
to
wonder
if
a
man
with
sensitive
ears
prefers
the
cafe
to
the
church
The
first
man
I
met
at
the
Moulds
Cafe
was
Francis
Saltus
poet
wit
raconteur
and
as
brilliant
as
his
brother
Edgar
Saltus
With
the
solitary
exception
of
Oscar
Wilde
I
never
heard
a
human
discourse
so
eloquently
as
Frank
nor
have
I
ever
known
such
a
perfect
Bohemian
William
Dean
Howells
has
told
us
of
the
group
that
gathered
at
Pfaff
s
several
decades
before
Fitz
James
O
Brien
who
wrote
the
most
horror-breeding
short
story
since
Poe
What
Was
It
or
some
such
title
a
story
that
is
as
vivid
as
de
Maupassant
s
Horla
and
one
that
furnished
Ambrose
Bierce
with
the
motive
for
his
best
tale
Walt
Whitman
who
probably
drank
buttermilk
as
he
neither
smoked
nor
touched
alcoholic
beverages
and
a
lot
of
chaps
Arnold
among
the
rest
whose
names
are
writ
in
water
The
Moulds
contingent
was
not
so
celebrated
but
the
actors
singers
painters
poets
news
paper
men
and
politicians
were
so
numerous
that
a
li
brary
might
be
filled
with
the
recital
of
their
accomplish
ments
Frank
Saltus
had
lived
the
major
part
of
his
life
in
Paris
He
was
a
member
of
the
Theophile
Gautier
circle
and
a
protege
of
le
bon
Theo
whose
polished
technique
and
impassible
attitude
towards
life
and
art
he
had
assimilated
When
I
hear
the
frantic
clamourings
made
by
uncritical
critics
over
some
newly-arrived
free
verse
bard
whose
poetry
is
a
jumble
of
Whitman
and
falling
bricks
I
wonder
if
they
ever
have
read
Francis
Saltus
He
was
a
poet
a
pagan
therefore
immoral
Now
the
immorality
is
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
by
the
young
poetasters
but
the
poetry
is
left
out
We
have
in
this
year
of
grace
many
poets
but
no
Poet
I
must
resort
to
obvious
capitalisation
Frank
Saltus
carved
sonnets
from
the
solid
block
He
wrote
epigrams
at
fifty
cents
apiece
for
Town
Topics
he
composed
feu
illetons
that
would
have
made
the
fortune
of
a
Paris
boulevardier
His
habits
were
irregular
though
he
got
up
earlier
than
Willie
Wilde
Oscar
s
brother
who
had
married
Mrs
Frank
Leslie
for
a
bedroom
so
he
said
And
Frank
Saltus
was
fond
of
absinthe
another
imported
habit
and
a
deadly
one
But
I
never
saw
him
drunk
and
I
never
saw
him
without
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
He
usually
arrived
about
noon
and
wrote
and
talked
till
the
last
trump
which
was
at
two
A
M
sometimes
later
The
classic
type
of
Bohemianism
that
has
quite
vanished
He
was
a
ruin
and
a
gentleman
who
had
evidently
been
very
handsome
The
photographs
taken
in
Paris
re
vealed
him
as
a
Greek
god
but
when
I
knew
him
his
good
looks
were
historical
Edgar
Saltus
was
handsome
in
a
different
style
dark
Italian
petit-maitre
a
prose
master
and
a
philosopher
There
was
a
sufficing
cause
for
the
punctuality
of
Frank
and
the
rest
of
us
at
Moulds
Free-lunch
Up
at
the
Hoffman
House
you
could
eat
a
regular
course
dinner
on
one
drink
but
you
had
to
tip
the
waiter
a
quarter
at
Moulds
there
were
no
tips
nor
was
there
an
assortment
of
dishes
The
glory
of
the
establishment
was
its
bean
soup
hot
savoury
plentiful
Oh
that
bean
soup
How
many
famished
stomachs
it
soothed
and
nourished
in
the
days
that
are
no
more
Pardon
me
if
I
shed
a
lyric
tear
over
its
memory
Billy
Moulds
retired
years
ago
to
darkest
Brooklyn
and
when
I
meet
him
I
speak
of
the
fabulous
soup
His
invariable
an
swer
is
It
saved
some
of
you
fellows
lives
didn
t
it
But
do
you
remember
Otto
and
his
razzle-dazzle
I
did
He
meant
Otto
Floersheim
who
had
devised
a
mixture
of
brandy
ginger
ale
and
absinthe
that
was
warranted
to
knock
a
horse
down
It
never
fazed
Floer
sheim
who
introduced
the
concoction
to
Albert
Niemann
the
Wagnerian
tenor
a
drinker
that
would
have
pleased
Pantagruel
To
see
this
pair
of
monsters
guzzle
the
poison
made
shudder
a
sensitive
and
beer-absorbing
soul
Niemann
could
booze
all
night
till
next
midday
and
then
sing
Siegmund
that
evening
in
a
marvellous
manner
But
not
marvellous
vocally
speaking
His
acting
the
assumption
of
the
character
was
the
chief
interest
His
voice
had
gone
before
he
visited
us
In
fact
it
was
be
ginning
to
go
at
the
first
Baireuth
Festival
in
1876
That
bean
soup
was
a
mainstay
for
us
when
the
weather
was
unfavourable
to
our
pocketbooks
And
there
were
plenty
of
rainy
days
The
critical
business
is
a
precarious
one
Writing
of
any
sort
still
is
unless
you
manufacture
a
best-seller
and
that
is
what
we
all
try
for
The
cashier
at
Moulds
was
a
brother
of
the
boss
and
had
been
a
keeper
at
the
Trenton
State
prison
Need
I
add
that
Tom
Moulds
was
judge
of
human
nature
Smiling
sympathetic
he
would
take
my
proffered
check
not
a
bank
cheque
and
hang
it
up
on
my
always
growing
account
I
see
it
s
not
Delmonico
s
to-day
bean
soup
eh
Well
it
s
healthier
and
more
filling
and
it
s
on
the
house
like
a
tin-roof
He
jested
but
he
had
a
warm
heart
and
an
open
purse
I
could
fill
pages
with
the
names
of
illustrious
actors
who
patronised
Moulds
Visiting
English
actors
went
there
instinctively
it
was
homelike
quiet
few
quarrels
before
midnight
and
good-fellowship
was
never
absent
The
old-timers
I
met
were
Frank
Mordaunt
Frank
Evans
J
B
Studley
Walter
Turner
and
an
Englishman
named
Liston
I
ve
seen
Booth
Barrett
McCuIIough
and
once
only
Lester
Wallack
there
The
musical
crowd
were
unfail
ing
visitors
I
met
every
evening
Augustus
Brentano
the
senior
brother
of
the
well-known
book-sellers
whose
big
store
was
on
Union
Square
next
to
Tiffany
s
Joseffy
and
Franz
Rummel
who
married
Leila
Morse
the
daughter
of
S
F
B
Morse
Sauret
Ovide
Musin
Ysaye
Gerardy
Max
Heinrich
Who
didn
t
go
to
Moulds
Many
the
commission
to
write
I
got
in
its
shadowy
back
room
The
music
trade-journalists
congregated
there
In
those
days
trade
journalism
had
not
been
standardised
the
same
with
the
weekly
sheets
devoted
to
theatricals
Each
editor
was
a
sharp-shooter
and
often
a
free
booter
on
his
own
account
Their
pens
knew
no
brother
Dickens
would
have
been
delighted
with
the
pages
of
personal
vituperation
that
were
published
and
without
bloodshed
ensuing
The
vilest
abuse
was
bandied
If
the
bug-juice
editor
who
was
found
by
the
police-patrol
wagon
early
last
Sunday
morning
as
he
sat
on
the
curb
stone
with
his
watch
dangling
in
the
gutter
near
the
M
ds
Cafe
a
subtle
difference
indeed
does
not
abandon
his
worship
of
Bacchus
this
would
be
fol
lowed
by
a
column
devoted
to
the
general
habits
of
the
aforesaid
bug-juice
editor
who
never
turned
a
hair
but
would
report
the
following
week
as
follows
Our
readers
should
not
listen
to
the
piteous
appeals
of
a
poor
decrepit
barnstormer
bad
actor
fugitive
bankrupt
who
is
after
the
money
of
gullible
piano
manufacturers
to
keep
his
rotten
little
sheet
from
perishing
As
the
original
pirate
in
the
trade
we
have
a
portrait
of
him
in
top
boots
big
hat
waving
the
piratical
black
flag
which
we
would
only
be
too
happy
to
show
our
readers
in
case
they
drop
in
and
pay
their
new
subscriptions
which
accurately
places
him
on
the
map
The
pot
calling
the
kettle
black
MUSICAL
JOURNALISM
Theatrical
journalism
was
even
more
personal
fisti
cuffs
being
the
last
resort
To-day
musical
journalism
is
greatly
improved
It
must
always
encourage
medi
ocrity
else
perish
And
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
daily
press
The
music-critics
when
I
came
to
New
York
were
Henry
T
Finck
of
The
Evening
Post
H
E
Krehbiel
of
The
Tribune
William
J
Henderson
of
The
Times
this
was
1887
later
Mr
Henderson
followed
me
as
music
editor
of
The
Sun
a
position
he
still
holds
John
T
Jackson
of
The
World
Bowman
of
The
Sun
his
wife
Mrs
Bowman
succeeded
him
Albert
Stein
berg
of
The
Herald
then
a
real
force
in
the
musical
world
and
other
men
on
the
afternoon
newspapers
such
as
Willy
von
Sachs
Edgar
J
Levey
both
dead
Jack
son
is
dead
so
is
Steinberg
but
the
rest
are
alive
vigor
ous
and
still
kicking
It
is
the
function
of
a
critic
to
kick
otherwise
he
is
considered
moribund
Add
Richard
Aldrich
to
the
list
for
when
I
became
dramatic
editor
of
The
Sun
in
1902
there
was
quite
a
displacement
in
our
frog-pond
Henderson
left
The
Times
for
The
Sun
Aldrich
the
assistant
music-critic
of
The
Tribune
went
to
The
Times
Edward
Ziegler
my
colleague
took
over
my
job
on
Town
Topics
where
for
years
I
had
more
fun
than
in
a
circus
and
also
assumed
the
musical
editorship
of
The
American
and
afterwards
The
Herald
And
Leonard
Liebling
followed
me
on
The
Musical
Courier
To-day
Ziegler
is
a
young
chap
who
dyes
his
hair
iron-grey
in
order
to
appear
older
At
the
Metro
politan
Opera
House
he
is
closely
allied
to
Director
Gatti
Casazza
All
these
men
Ziegler
excepted
I
worked
with
from
the
beginning
and
they
are
still
my
friends
Something
to
boast
about
if
you
realise
that
the
artistic
temperament
pervades
the
soul
of
the
music-critic
that
a
more
touchier
set
of
humans
would
be
difficult
to
find
except
actors
a
critic
is
thinner-skinned
than
his
victims
and
hates
to
be
criticised
We
had
our
little
tiffs
but
no
serious
embroilments
Albert
Steinberg
was
the
disruptive
force
With
a
wit
that
was
posi
tively
malignant
he
would
place
his
surgical
steel
on
your
sorest
place
and
your
vanity
bled
He
had
a
musical
ear
much
experience
sound
taste
and
his
guesses
were
often
as
telling
as
riper
knowledge
But
he
was
lazy
a
race-course
gambler
though
not
a
drink
ing
man
When
he
was
cremated
at
Fresh
Pond
a
telegram
from
the
De
Reszke
brothers
then
on
tour
was
the
only
intimation
that
the
dead
man
had
once
occupied
a
commanding
position
in
the
metropolis
Musicians
like
actors
have
a
short
memory
Steinberg
was
a
powerful
aid
to
Lillian
Nordica
at
a
time
when
she
needed
friends
Maurice
Grau
told
me
this
I
knew
it
already
nor
was
Madame
Nordica
ungrateful
She
possessed
a
big
heart
Yet
there
was
Steinberg
dead
with
no
one
to
tender
his
remains
a
last
salute
except
Theodore
Stein
who
like
Madame
Frida
Ashforth
took
care
of
him
through
a
long
illness
and
a
few
faithful
friends
for
the
most
part
strangers
to
me
However
Steinway
and
Sons
sent
a
representative
As
for
his
absent
colleagues
it
must
be
said
that
Steinberg
had
estranged
them
by
his
savage
tongue
But
it
was
all
desperately
sad
this
ending
of
a
brilliant
cultivated
if
wayward
critic
Music-criticism
as
a
profession
c
est
du
cimetiere
Or
the
crematory
An
ill-omen
for
me
this
funeral
I
had
attended
one
of
the
Music
Teachers
National
Association
meetings
at
Indianapolis
in
the
summer
of
vincial
professionals
and
no
doubt
useful
for
New
Yorkers
they
smacked
much
of
the
local
festival
that
blooms
in
the
spring
But
I
was
too
young
to
be
hypercritical
and
enjoyed
myself
with
the
rest
Frank
Van
Stucken
of
Belgian
stock
born
in
Texas
conducted
the
orchestra
and
I
again
met
Marc
Blumenberg
We
became
more
intimate
When
I
returned
to
New
York
I
visited
his
office
and
saw
much
of
him
and
his
partner
and
presently
I
was
writing
for
The
Musical
Courier
only
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
I
didn
t
get
salary
till
working
for
other
people
at
reduced
rates
But
I
had
nothing
to
complain
of
in
regard
to
Blumenberg
s
gen
erosity
nor
Floersheim
s
either
Otto
was
improvident
an
enraged
gambler
plundered
by
the
bookmakers
with
a
childlike
credulity
in
tips
he
was
also
the
sort
of
friend
who
would
take
off
his
coat
to
help
you
I
judge
these
two
men
as
I
found
them
I
was
a
stranger
to
them
and
they
took
me
in
No
doubt
I
was
useful
Blumenberg
was
a
pragmatic
Jew
yet
no
more
prag
matic
than
the
average
Gentile
business
man
Both
had
a
certain
reputation
like
most
trade-journalists
yet
during
my
fifteen
years
connection
with
The
Musical
Courier
I
was
never
asked
to
do
anything
that
smelled
queer
nor
write
anything
but
what
I
saw
fit
Once
only
Blumenberg
attempted
to
coerce
me
and
oddly
enough
it
concerned
The
Sun
and
not
his
own
journal
I
have
saved
the
letter
in
which
he
told
Driggs
the
manager
that
if
I
didn
t
cease
praising
Gadski
in
The
Sun
he
would
get
Krehbiel
of
The
Tribune
to
write
my
depart
ment
entitled
The
Raconteur
This
was
such
a
joy
ous
crack
that
the
little
editor
had
to
laugh
himself
when
I
shrieked
at
the
suggestion
Krehbiel
smiled
too
for
The
Raconteur
was
a
rag-bag
an
olla-podrida
page
which
I
wrote
from
1887
to
1902
Not
only
would
Krehbiel
have
indignantly
rejected
the
offer
but
try
as
he
might
have
he
couldn
t
manufacture
such
a
mess
as
my
columns
of
gossip
crazy
fantasy
and
whirling
comment
And
that
was
the
only
time
I
had
a
dis
agreement
with
Marc
Blumenberg
The
joke
of
the
matter
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
season
or
two
previous
I
had
criticised
Madame
Gadski
in
The
Sun
which
news
paper
I
joined
in
1900
and
Blumenberg
protested
The
reason
Ask
me
not
in
gentle
numbers
life
is
such
a
dream
Well
for
fifteen
years
I
ran
amuck
in
The
Courier
Occasionally
Hugh
Craig
his
literary
taste
outraged
at
my
lack
of
method
would
complain
he
edited
the
copy
of
the
staff
and
an
indignant
subscriber
would
protest
that
The
Raconteur
should
not
be
tolerated
in
a
family
where
there
were
girls
Oh
what
a
lot
of
girl
readers
I
had
then
I
know
because
I
received
so
many
letters
from
them
but
neither
Blumenberg
nor
Floersheim
bothered
himself
about
me
I
was
Crazy
Jim
the
Idealist
let
him
have
his
fling
The
truth
was
that
musical
journalists
lived
only
because
of
the
rivalries
of
piano
manufacturers
The
subscription
list
didn
t
much
matter
indeed
the
greater
the
number
of
subscribers
the
higher
the
bills
for
paper
and
printing
One
piano
house
could
support
a
trade-journal
And
logically
the
editorial
policy
of
attacking
the
music
critics
of
the
daily
press
was
inexpugnable
There
could
be
no
rapprochement
They
were
the
enemy
Crush
them
Get
thee
gone
girl
but
the
girl
wouldn
t
get
thee
gone
as
Hughey
Dougherty
or
Lew
Simmons
used
to
sing
at
the
minstrel
shows
The
critics
contin
ued
to
write
what
they
believed
to
be
the
truth
and
they
were
attacked
Who
was
to
blame
for
this
system
The
mediocrities
who
wished
pleasant
things
written
of
them
in
the
trade-journals
or
their
editors
As
an
ethical
question
I
fancy
there
isn
t
much
doubt
as
to
the
answer
but
as
a
business
proposition
there
is
some
thing
to
be
said
for
the
musical
journals
or
the
box
office
Business
is
such
a
ripe-rotten
affair
no
matter
where
you
go
that
these
editorial
gentlemen
had
their
self-justification
I
never
judge
fearing
judgment
so
I
can
only
say
that
to-day
conditions
are
different
Music
trade
editors
ride
in
their
motor-cars
are
heavy
bond
holders
and
don
t
bother
about
the
music-critics
who
are
the
same
ill-paid
pariahs
they
were
thirty
years
ago
Who
loves
a
critic
Once
a
music-critic
always
a
pau
per
that
is
if
you
don
t
marry
a
rich
girl
or
are
not
born
to
the
purple
as
was
Reginald
De
Koven
The
world
takes
no
interest
in
the
quarrels
of
rival
editors
We
were
up
to
our
necks
in
scandals
and
libel
suits
The
Musical
Courier
was
sued
by
Fred
Schwab
former
music-critic
of
The
Times
and
Town
Topics
for
uttering
a
libel
Poor
foolish
Floersheim
had
picked
the
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
for
other
people
smarting
under
Schwab
s
attack
on
them
in
Town
Topics
and
he
picked
them
so
clumsily
that
The
Courier
had
to
retract
its
sen
timents
or
heavily
suffer
The
venerable
owner
of
The
Times
Mr
Jones
was
subpoenaed
but
turned
so
deaf
in
the
witness-chair
that
he
never
told
the
jury
why
Schwab
had
been
discharged
or
allowed
to
resign
from
The
Times
The
musical
town
sniggered
The
Musical
Courier
did
not
Then
I
advised
Blumenberg
to
engage
Schwab
to
write
criticism
on
the
opera
and
he
did
so
Fred
Schwab
a
practical
man
with
a
sly
sense
of
humour
consented
and
behold
the
quarrel
was
forgotten
Krehbiel
Hen
derson
Finck
Irenseus
Prime-Stevenson
and
Edgar
J
Levey
were
at
one
time
contributors
to
The
Courier
and
their
names
were
printed
at
the
top
of
the
editorial
page
This
was
as
early
as
1887
or
1888
The
collab
oration
didn
t
last
long
Blumenberg
and
Floersheim
waxed
rich
but
I
didn
t
If
there
were
ill-gotten
gains
they
were
scrupulously
concealed
from
me
I
got
a
plain
living
for
my
work
and
I
worked
hard
the
dreariest
kind
of
labour
going
to
every
tenth-rate
concert
tramping
out
every
night
wind
or
weather
never
deterring
me
to
Chickering
Hall
to
Steinway
Hall
to
the
Academy
to
the
Metropolitan
Opera
House
Carnegie
Hall
was
not
built
nor
was
Aeolian
Hall
we
went
to
Mendelssohn
Hall
or
Madison
Square
Garden
Concert
Hall
In
the
nineties
when
Floersheim
definitely
retired
to
Europe
I
had
a
freer
hand
and
I
edited
the
musical
section
in
an
easy-going
fashion
I
was
mildly
reproved
once
a
week
for
men
tioning
the
names
of
the
other
critics
and
as
I
was
with
them
day
and
night
I
didn
t
heed
the
advice
You
are
advertising
these
people
throughout
the
country
Marc
would
say
but
he
didn
t
interfere
till
years
had
passed
and
the
enmity
became
uglier
The
quarrel
seemed
childish
to
me
then
a
tempest
in
a
tin
can
Blumenberg
got
the
notion
that
I
could
with
training
be
made
useful
in
the
trade
department
of
The
Courier
and
for
many
months
he
took
me
with
him
from
Harlem
to
Brooklyn
interviewing
piano
manufacturers
and
dealers
I
wrote
grotesques
and
burlesques
I
created
fictitious
firms
There
was
a
certain
Mr
Diggs
of
Pilltown
whose
adventures
were
chronicled
weekly
and
I
dare
say
amused
or
else
saddened
some
readers
But
I
didn
t
have
any
flair
for
business
I
was
frivolous
when
I
should
have
been
solemn
and
Blumenberg
would
look
at
me
reproachfully
or
giggle
he
was
a
grown-up
boy
A
man
of
musical
talent
he
possessed
a
well-lined
intellect
He
was
a
student
of
history
and
a
patriot
One
morning
too
bright
and
too
early
for
we
had
been
up
all
night
we
went
over
to
the
Ernest
Gabler
piano
manufactory
and
there
I
was
introduced
to
the
head
of
the
house
after
being
duly
warned
to
be
careful
I
was
very
care
ful
In
my
lightest
manner
I
said
after
I
shook
hands
Mr
Gabler
you
make
me
think
of
an
aunt
of
mine
we
always
called
an
earnest
gabbler
The
man
s
face
clouded
then
turning
to
Marc
he
grimly
said
Bloomy
this
young
fellow
would
make
a
better
piano-tuner
than
a
trade-journalist
don
t
you
think
so
We
left
in
a
few
minutes
and
around
the
corner
Blumenberg
ex
ploded
I
was
nervous
but
when
I
saw
him
holding
his
sides
and
roaring
with
glee
I
felt
relieved
The
silly
pun
had
tickled
his
risible
rib
and
even
if
he
had
lost
the
advertisement
he
would
have
laughed
He
was
that
kind
of
a
man
He
was
also
another
he
gave
much
in
charity
he
lent
money
to
the
music-teachers
he
was
sup
posed
to
bleed
I
know
this
I
didn
t
go
to
piano-tuning
I
was
already
a
tuner
of
criticism
The
ending
of
Marc
Antony
Blumenberg
was
not
without
that
touch
of
irony
inherent
in
matters
mundane
Although
he
was
up
to
his
ears
in
criminal
libels
and
lawsuits
he
died
at
Paris
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
The
American
colony
headed
by
the
American
Minister
and
musical
Paris
honoured
the
bier
of
the
dead
man
the
newspapers
had
naught
but
praise
for
his
unselfish
devotion
to
art
Even
his
most
ferocious
enemies
in
America
would
have
been
silenced
by
such
an
imposing
demonstration
His
faults
no
doubt
were
many
but
he
boasted
virtues
that
some
of
his
opponents
could
not
Above
all
he
was
not
a
hypocrite
If
he
called
the
kettle
black
he
cheerfully
admitted
the
sootiness
of
the
pot
I
never
came
in
con
tact
with
a
more
agile
intellect
nor
with
a
cheerier
nature
than
his
He
was
a
politician
born
who
had
the
misfor
tune
to
operate
in
a
restricted
field
Some
of
his
schemes
and
dreams
which
seemed
extravagant
and
Utopian
at
the
time
for
example
a
piano
manufacturers
trust
are
to-day
a
commonplace
He
had
as
many
friends
as
enemies
and
he
raised
merry
hell
his
life
long
I
remember
speaking
of
a
few
cultivated
families
in
Philadelphia
which
were
my
solace
during
the
dark
inter
val
between
my
return
from
Paris
and
my
hegira
to
New
York
One
of
these
families
was
the
Houghs
on
South
Sixteenth
Street
Mrs
Hough
before
her
marriage
to
Isaac
Hough
was
Mrs
Amelia
Thibault
and
the
mother
of
three
sons
my
closest
friends
They
were
all
musical
and
with
their
cousin
John
T
Boyd
we
were
a
phalanx
of
enthusiasms
The
Thibault
boys
Frank
Fritz
and
Carow
were
of
French
descent
on
the
paternal
side
Fritz
died
from
fatigue
and
exposure
in
the
Spanish
War
Mrs
Hough
was
a
fountain
of
affection
She
was
a
benign
influence
in
her
circle
Dr
Thomas
H
Fen
ton
and
his
wife
born
Lizzie
Remak
was
another
musical
family
Mrs
Fenton
is
an
excellent
pianist
Dr
Fenton
a
singer
and
member
of
the
Orpheus
The
Mawsons
on
Arch
Street
were
well
known
Mrs
Mawson
an
Englishwoman
of
the
old
cultured
school
had
an
evening
at
home
where
you
would
meet
artistic
people
worth
knowing
Her
children
have
made
a
name
for
themselves
Harry
Mawson
playwright
Edward
Mawson
actor
who
was
a
man
with
a
lovable

the
young

and
intellec
tual
Lucie
Mawson

resides
in
Lon

where
she

and

well-liked
Through
the
good
graces
of
this
family
I
was
introduced
to
the
Garrigues
of
New
York
In
the
middle
eighties
they
lived
on
Seventeenth
Street
near
Union
Square
To
say
109
East
sufficed
for
the
musical
elect
It
was
a
cen
tre
of
sweetness
and
light
The
father
Rudolph
Gar
rigue
a
dynamic
Dane
was
president
of
an
insurance
company
His
daughters
played
sang
and
wrote
As
their
mother
said
to
me
I
never
see
them
except
at
meal-time
but
I
hear
them
day
and
night
This
with
a
gesture
of
mock
despair
she
belonged
to
a
generation
less
strenuous
a
generation
that
did
not
take
the
kingdom
of
heaven
by
assault
Several
of
them
have
attained
distinction
as
musical
instructors
The
eldest
daughter
married
Professor
Thomas
Garrigue
Masaryk
of
Prague
just
now
in
the
public
eye
as
first
president
of
the
Czecho-SIovaks
In
this
household
I
was
gently
encouraged
in
my
vari
ous
mild
lunacies
The
pianist
Eleanor
Garrigue
Fer
guson
married
to
Henry
Ferguson
a
landscape-painter
had
advised
me
to
come
to
New
York
like
most
New
Yorkers
she
considered
Philadelphia
a
pent-up
Utica
In
1885
I
had
witnessed
the
debut
of
Fannie
Bloomfield
Zeisler
at
the
old
Academy
of
Music
she
played
Rubin
stein
s
D
minor
piano
concerto
with
such
fire
and
brilliancy
that
the
conductor
and
orchestra
pantingly
followed
her
impetuous
lead
and
I
met
so
many
artistic
people
at
the
Garrigues
that
I
then
and
there
renounced
the
city
of
my
birth
I
breathed
an
atmosphere
ozone-charged
The
idols
of
my
youth
were
to
be
seen
perambulating
Irving
Place
Union
Square
Fourteenth
Street
At
Lienau
s
you
might
see
William
Steinway
in
the
flesh
an
immense
political
influence
as
well
as
a
musical
Theo
dore
Thomas
lived
on
East
Seventeenth
Street
opposite
the
Garrigues
William
Mason
would
alight
from
the
little
blue
horse-car
which
ran
across
Seventeenth
Street
at
Union
Square
He
lived
in
Orange
N
J
and
always
stopped
at
Brubacher
s
where
he
met
S
B
Mills
before
beginning
his
lessons
at
Steinway
Hall
A
polished

delightful
raconteur
Mr
Mason
could
discourse
by
the

Ill
IN
THE
MAELSTROM
After
I
left
the
quaint
Seventh
Avenue
house
I
had
swarmed
up
a
column
from
the
second-story
piazza
to
the
third
and
though
it
was
a
warm
night
my
absence
of
superfluous
attire
and
the
general
row
that
ensued
it
was
because
of
a
bet
made
me
seek
lodgings
elsewhere
A
small
family
hotel
at
the
northeast
corner
of
Irving
Place
and
Seventeenth
Street
kept
by
an
elderly
couple
was
noted
for
its
cooking
and
cheerfulness
Werle
s
too
was
an
artistic
rendezvous
and
its
table-d
hote
dinner
saw
many
celebrities
There
were
always
entertaining
companions
It
was
one
of
those
houses
where
at
any
time
before
midnight
the
sound
of
pianos
violins
violon
cellos
even
the
elegiac
flute
might
be
heard
and
usually
played
by
skilled
professionals
There
was
also
much
vocal
squawking
Across
the
street
was
still
is
the
pretty
Washington
Irving
house
and
at
another
corner
lived
Victor
Herbert
From
the
vine-covered
entrance
of
Werle
s
I
often
heard
string
music
made
by
Victor
Herbert
Max
Bendix
then
concert-master
of
the
Thomas
Orchestra
and
a
Philadelphian
and
others
I
occupied
on
the
ground
floor
a
room
about
as
big
as
the
one
I
had
lived
in
at
Paris
It
held
a
bed
an
upright
piano
a
trunk
some
books
and
music
It
had
one
ad
vantage
it
was
easy
of
access
and
one
disadvantage
I
never
knew
when
I
would
be
alone
Friends
knocked
on
the
window
with
their
sticks
at
all
hours
of
the
night
They
also
sang
concerted
noises
Finally
I
stayed
out
on
purpose
till
dawn
to
escape
their
intrusions
The
dining-room
was
in
the
basement
a
New
York
institu
tion
I
was
soon
introduced
to
my
neighbour
the
Red
Countess
Madame
Von
Shevitch
Her
husband
a
pleasant
Russian
nobleman
was
editor
of
a
radical
news
paper
She
was
a
large
rather
stout
woman
with
red
hair
of
the
rich
hue
called
Titian
Her
face
was
too
fleshy
for
beauty
but
there
were
forms
and
accents
that
told
of
its
past
the
fine
harmonious
brow
the
intense
ex
pression
of
the
eyes
still
splendid
of
hue
and
delicately
set
like
precious
jewels
the
pallor
of
her
skin
sulphur-white
her
aristocratic
bearing
and
the
contours
of
her
well
moulded
head
attracted
me
at
once
She
spoke
fluently
a
half-dozen
languages
I
didn
t
know
who
she
was
as
the
name
Von
Shevitch
was
just
one
more
Slav
in
this
abbreviated
map
of
Europe
But
when
Mother
Werle
whispered
to
me
The
Red
Countess
otherwise
the
Golden-crested
Serpent
otherwise
the
Princess
Raco
witza
otherwise
Helena
von
Doenniges
Stop
I
cried
You
mean
Clotilde
Riidiger
the
heroine
of
George
Meredith
s
novel
The
Tragic
Comedians
The
moment
was
almost
historic
It
sent
me
back
to
Mere
dith
and
this
exasperating
clever
fiction
written
in
his
most
crackling
incendiary
style
This
woman
opposite
me
at
table
who
ate
suet
dumplings
as
she
discoursed
art
philosophy
fiction
and
politics
was
the
direct
cause
of
the
death
of
Ferdinand
Lassalle
of
whom
Bismarck
had
said
When
he
goes
into
the
field
I
ll
shut
up
shop
He
said
this
in
the
fifties
Lassalle
was
a
fol
lower
of
Karl
Marx
acharne
though
he
soon
set
up
a
rival
socialism
a
democratic
socialism
with
a
new
brand
of
which
he
was
the
agitator
This
handsome
audacious
Jew
brilliant
as
to
attainments
an
orator
who
could
wind
a
mob
around
his
voice
had
made
love
to
Helena
Von
Doenniges
the
daughter
of
a
rich
aristo
cratic
Munich
family
one
of
those
blown-in-the-glass
fam
ilies
that
exist
to
make
plain
people
foam
at
the
mouth
Not
only
did
she
win
the
homage
of
this
leader
of
men
but
Richard
Wagner
had
admired
her
too
much
for
the
peace
of
Cosima
von
Billow
afterwards
his
wife
Cosima
Wagner
But
the
haughty
Von
Doenniges
family
showed
Lassalle
the
door
They
also
set
a
cousin
on
him
the
Rumanian
Prince
Yanko
Racowitza
A
duel
followed
and
Ferdinand
Lassalle
the
one
great
force
of
the
Social
Democrats
one
apparently
born
to
lead
the
German
people
from
the
jungle
of
absolutism
Heinrich
Heine
proclaimed
this
was
killed
Worse
followed
She
mar
ried
the
poor
Prince
and
when
he
died
of
galloping
con
sumption
five
months
later
a
form
of
her
revenge
she
married
a
handsome
actor
Friedmann
but
soon
divorced
him
Two
prima
donnas
in
one
family
Then
she
mar
ried
Serge
Von
Shevitch
who
had
fled
from
Russia
after
some
revolutionary
enterprise
Although
an
aristocrat
he
was
a
liberal
too
liberal
like
Prince
Krapotkin
for
the
autocracy
on
the
Neva
She
had
lived
what
is
called
a
full
life
Her
published
recollections
of
Lassalle
fell
into
the
hands
of
George
Meredith
The
Tragic
Come
dians
followed
She
was
bitter
over
that
book
a
libel
she
told
me
of
her
relations
with
the
grand
Democrat
She
had
known
intimately
Bulwer
Dickens
Liszt
always
philandering
after
girls
Napoleon
and
Eugenie
Bismarck
and
a
forest
of
other
celebrities
She
came
to
America
in
1877
and
remained
till
1890
when
she
re
turned
to
Munich
and
after
sundry
vicissitudes
she
com
mitted
suicide
in
1911
a
few
days
later
than
her
hus
band
s
self-murder
Truly
a
Tragic
Comedian
I
sup
pose
I
was
influenced
by
her
version
of
the
case
and
wrote
of
her
as
a
woman
abused
but
Mr
Meredith
stuck
to
his
guns
and
amicably
informed
me
that
some
day
I
might
be
brought
to
his
way
of
thinking
Frank
Swinnerton
in
his
authoritative
work
on
George
Meredith
treats
of
the
matter
and
wonders
whether
I
am
a
Jew
Possibly
be
cause
I
had
quoted
the
word
Chutzpe
ponem
applied
to
Lassalle
by
some
of
his
co-religionists
meaning
im
pertinent
Mr
Swinnerton
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
a
driver
of
fat
oxen
must
himself
be
fat
Lassalle
had
been
known
as
The
Social
Luther
and
his
fight
ing
motto
was
State
Support
for
Co-operative
Produc
tion
He
was
not
in
sympathy
with
passive
resist
ance
as
a
weapon
against
the
government
A
fallacy
he
said
Passive
resistance
is
the
resistance
which
does
not
resist
And
this
citizen
of
the
world
as
he
called
himself
fell
before
The
shaky
pistol
of
the
unhappy
Danube
Osier
Prince
Racowitza
though
himself
a
dead
shot
and
a
professed
anti-duellist
To
show
you
that
Mere
dith
had
sounded
the
insincerity
of
Helena
when
I
asked
her
why
she
hadn
t
eloped
with
Lassalle
she
calmly
re
plied
that
she
had
enjoyed
a
brief
elopement
He
was
at
Righi-Kaltbad
for
his
health
and
she
slipped
away
from
her
parents
at
Geneva
and
went
to
her
lover
At
the
age
of
nearly
sixty-eight
she
wrote
another
volume
of
memoirs
Unblushingly
she
admitted
this
passionate
intermezzo
Perhaps
it
accounts
for
the
tragic
ending
Something
happened
incompatability
of
temperament
may
be
discovered
in
five
minutes
and
the
lovers
never
met
again
I
asked
her
whether
her
family
had
disliked
Ferdinand
Lassalle
merely
because
of
his
Jewish
blood
and
she
smiled
My
grandmother
was
a
Jewess
and
secretly
aided
our
affair
No
he
was
a
social
firebrand
feared
by
Bismarck
hated
by
Richard
Wagner
and
then
that
Countess
Hatzfeldt
affair
he
had
been
very
friendly
with
this
woman
and
many
other
things
also
his
im
petuous
manner
of
wooing
I
have
her
picture
after
the
celebrated
portrait
by
Von
Lenbach
which
she
sent
me
in
the
keeping
of
Frida
Ashforth
Her
beauty
in
youth
must
have
been
exquisite
for
exquisite
in
this
pale
transcription
are
her
features
and
eyes
I
saw
in
life
the
glory
of
her
hair
Why
did
the
Von
Shevitch
pair
kill
themselves
Poverty
for
one
reason
self-disgust
and
boredom
for
another
They
had
lived
in
their
flush
times
like
nabobs
The
decadence
began
in
New
York
Werle
s
house
was
not
precisely
palatial
though
for
lean
purses
a
paradise
A
few
days
before
their
death
Madame
Ashforth
who
is
I
need
hardly
add
a
famous
vocal
teacher
in
New
York
saw
the
couple
Naturally
she
assisted
them
after
frantic
telegrams
had
reached
her
Helena
begged
her
not
to
give
Serge
Von
Shevitch
money
He
spends
it
all
on
the
girls
What
an
ending
Meredith
could
have
written
a
still
more
tragic
coda
to
his
story
if
he
had
known
it
I
am
now
making
amends
to
his
clairvoyance
and
for
presumptuously
chal
lenging
his
intuitions
But
I
was
young
and
believed
what
women
told
me
and
was
she
not
the
Red
Coun
tess
What
childlike
faith
a
clever
woman
can
arouse
when
she
plays
the
role
of
the
misunderstood
especially
when
she
confides
her
misery
to
a
young
fool
The
fascination
of
a
story
set
to
music
sung
by
men
and
women
in
a
picturesque
setting
is
as
ancient
as
the
immemorial
hills
In
America
our
passion
for
opera
is
divided
by
our
love
of
baseball
yet
we
are
a
musical
nation
I
preach
this
when
optimists
deny
it
after
hearing
so
much
canned
music
And
in
music
we
are
neutral
I
am
writing
of
pre-war
times
No
particular
nationality
may
claim
exclusive
dominion
in
the
tone
art
though
roughly
set
down
the
order
of
historical
pre
cedence
is
this
Italian
German
French
English
and
the
rest
somewhere
in
the
field
I
have
heard
opera
in
Yiddish
in
Czech
and
doubtless
opera
in
some
sort
of
volapiik
will
be
sung
some
day
I
mention
these
vari
ous
tongues
as
the
tide
of
fashion
has
again
set
towards
Italy
In
my
youth
it
was
Italy
Then
for
a
period
came
Germany
then
Italian
and
French
followed
by
German
and
now
Italian
All
of
which
proves
nothing
or
everything
When
in
doubt
consult
Brother
Kreh
biePs
Chapters
in
Operas
I
do
not
always
follow
my
own
advice
and
occasionally
come
to
grief
for
I
am
not
a
date-monger
The
impresarios
in
my
early
days
were
Max
Maretzek
the
Strakosch
brothers
Maurice
and
Max
one
of
them
married
Amalia
Patti
but
don
t
ask
me
which
Maurice
was
an
accompanist
of
merit
I
heard
him
at
the
keyboard
supporting
the
rich
voice
of
Parepa
Rosa
Elsewhere
in
Unicorns
I
have
spoken
of
Vieuxtemps
fat
Brignoli
Rubinstein
and
Wieniawski
Opera
has
been
going
to
the
demnition
bow-wows
since
Noah
criticised
the
tone-production
of
the
first
soiled
dove
in
the
ark
And
from
Mount
Ararat
to
Broad
way
there
has
been
one
prolonged
wail
of
protest
against
prevailing
methods
in
contemporary
opera
in
a
phrase
from
Genesis
to
Giulio
Gatti-Casazza
My
father
a
half
century
ago
informed
me
that
opera
was
heading
for
the
dogs
that
Brignoli
who
sang
like
an
angel
and
looked
like
a
macaroni
baker
was
nothing
compared
to
who
was
it
Some
by-gone
operatic
Johnnie
Oh
yes
Mario
I
never
saw
a
better
actor-tenor
than
Cam
panini
though
I
ve
seen
as
good
acting
by
voiceless
tenors
No
names
please
But
opera
was
a
mixed
affair
then
It
still
bore
the
circus
stamp
of
the
seventies
Before
he
could
play
in
symphony
in
one
evening
s
programme
Theodore
Thomas
was
forced
to
placate
his
audiences
with
dance
tunes
single
movements
from
Haydn
Mozart
and
Beethoven
or
arrangements
of
piano
pieces
such
as
Schumann
s
Traumerei
In
opera
the
cheap
spec
tacular
ruled
Singers
were
advertised
like
freaks
and
managers
always
a
half
step
from
ruin
That
manager
is
become
an
extinct
type
Only
the
pen
of
Charles
Dickens
could
have
characterised
the
late
Henry
Maple
son
the
Colonel
as
he
was
affectionately
named
Com
pared
with
him
the
florid
personality
of
Sir
Gus
Harris
was
a
silhouette
A
perfect
flowering
was
Colonel
Maple
son
bluff
or
tactful
roaring
or
ingratiating
as
occasion
demanded
He
was
the
most
successful
lion-tamer
vocal
lions
I
ever
encountered
He
could
make
a
blank
cheque
sing
with
potential
wealth
A
prima
donna
rage
in
her
heart
and
a
horse-whip
under
her
coat
has
been
seen
to
leave
him
placated
hopeful
even
smiling
The
particular
artistic
ointment
used
by
the
Colonel
as
a
cure-all
for
irritated
artistic
vanity
was
antique
flattery
If
promises
were
rejected
he
applied
and
with
astonishing
results
the
unguent
of
fat
praise
he
literally
smeared
his
singers
Then
conscious
that
another
night
had
been
saved
that
Signorina
Pugnetto
or
Signor
Niente
were
conquered
the
Colonel
would
exclaim
in
that
pro
digious
voice
of
his
My
boy
I
say
What
about
a
cold
bottle
His
nephew
Lionel
Mapleson
is
libra
rian
of
the
Metropolitan
Opera
House
a
post
he
has
held
for
over
thirty
years
The
truth
is
that
clumsy
methods
were
to
blame
in
those
antediluvian
days
Opera
from
the
financial
view-point
was
as
much
a
fly
by-night
affair
as
the
veriest
theatrical
barnstormer
before
the
perfecting
of
the
managerial
machine
by
Froh
man
and
Hayman
Now
w
T
hen
opera
production
is
safely
standardised
we
are
confronted
by
the
undeniable
fact
that
the
grand
manner
in
singing
has
vanished
and
that
few
plays
are
worth
the
paper
on
which
they
are
typewritten
Nor
is
this
a
dyspeptic
opinion
So
true
is
it
that
managerial
foresight
abetted
by
shrewd
composers
dis
counted
long
ago
the
possibility
It
is
an
age
of
medi
ocrity
the
world
over
As
first-class
singers
are
rare
the
operatic
mills
grind
out
something
that
demands
neither
superlative
vocal
art
nor
superior
acting
just
that
flying
fish
known
as
a
singing-actress
or
singing-actor
For
one
Olive
Fremstad
one
Matzenauer
we
are
given
a
flock
of
young
men
and
women
who
neither
act
nor
sing
convincingly
Instead
of
the
glorious
voices
we
heard
at
the
Academy
or
Metropolitan
Opera
we
are
offered
more
placid
entertainment
a
better
ensemble
better
stage
productions
the
splendor
and
variety
of
the
scene
painter
s
art
and
at
least
some
compensation
a
larger
more
balanced
orchestra
and
greater
conductors
There
were
no
Seidls
no
Toscaninis
in
the
long
ago
Signor
Arditi
bald
rotund
self-complaisant
waved
his
white
gloved
hand
and
Adelina
Patti
sang
the
wooing
measures
of
his
II
Bacio
As
for
the
stage
management
it
was
the
abomination
of
desolation
Because
a
gauze
curtain
misses
at
the
opera
now
there
are
columns
of
protest
in
the
newspapers
What
would
our
captious
young
scribes
have
written
during
the
mighty
regime
when
SeidI
conducted
and
Lilli
Lehmann
Marianne
Brandt
Niemann
Fischer
Robinson
and
Alvary
were
in
the
company
when
the
singing
was
interrupted
by
refrac
tory
scenery
when
the
Rheingold
was
like
a
natatorium
of
frogs
legs
when
that
great
artist
and
instinctive
housewife
Brandt
stooped
to
pick
up
the
potion
vial
as
she
sang
Brangaene
it
had
rolled
under
the
couch
of
the
Irish
Princess
and
with
Isolde
and
Tristan
writhing
in
ecstasy
hard
by
Yet
the
stage
manager
Theodore
Hablemann
made
an
envious
reputation
The
truth
is
that
grand
opera
is
like
a
table-d
hote
dinner
The
pub
lic
expects
each
course
to
be
a
miracle
but
ends
by
accept
ing
the
good
bad
and
indifferent
It
s
a
cheap
meal
at
any
price
with
music
thrown
in
Vogue

I
am
not
particularly
interested
in
the
evolution
of
the
operatic
machine
but
I
do
remember
the
golden
days
they
were
usually
leaden
ones
for
the
singers
and
man
agers
Both

Adelina
Patti
when
I
last
heard
her
in
Albert
Hall
London
was
a
young
ish
old
lady
with
a
blonde
wig
her
voice
with
an
occasional
strand
of
gold
in
it
and
it
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
organs
since
Catalani
why
drag
in
Catty
Because
she
is
always
mentioned
by
some
critical
Struldbrug
in

with
Aunt
Adelina
like
Dean
Swift
s
horrid
old
man
of
Laputa
music-critics
never

they
dry
up
and

Brignoli
ate
too
much
and
died
lima
di
Murska
married
too
much
and
died
and
to
my
surprise
her
manager
Signor
de
Vivo
died
But
his
ghost
keeps
company
with
the
spirit
of
SeidI
in
the
lobbies
of
the
Opera
De
Vivo
was
a
character
He
had
a
memory
that
stretched
back
to
Gluck
or
to
the
early
Florentine
opera
reformers
He
could
relate
the
most
moving
tales
of
managerial
mishaps
We
christened
him
the
Ancient
Mariner
He
was
a
kindly
soul
and
for
young
reporters
of
music
a
treasure-trove
At
that
time
our
night
school
was
held
on
the
Thirty-ninth
Street
side
of
the
Opera
House
The
critical
chain-gang
were
not
so
comfortably
situated
as
now
Maurice
Grau
had
recognised
that
music-critics
are
almost
human
and
his
press-room
be
came
an
institution
instead
of
a
bleak
barn
I
say
bleak
because
in
the
old
days
critical
comment
was
mostly
written
in
noisy
cafes
With
the
advent
of
the
press
room
and
messenger
service
criticism
was
put
on
a
rea
sonable
basis
The
picturesque
character
of
the
old-time
operatic
manager
was
missing
in
the
firm
of
Abbey
Schoeffel
Grau
Those
business
men
were
devoid
of
the
free
booter
spirit
Maurice
Grau
had
experimented
with
French
opera
of
the
lighter
variety
He
had
served
his
apprenticeship
under
the
watchful
eye
of
his
uncle
Jacob
Grau
With
Henry
E
Abbey
I
seldom
came
in
contact
He
was
not
musical
though
a
managerial
Czar
I
be
lieve
he
admired
Lillian
Russell
more
than
any
of
his
imported
prima
donnas
with
the
exception
of
Nellie
Melba
Mr
Krehbiel
has
told
us
of
Abbey
s
belief
that
Melba
would
outshine
Calve
but
Maurice
Grau
knew
better
Maurice
I
found
charming
companionable
and
willing
to
judge
a
case
fairly
We
met
in
the
old
Hotel
St
James
at
the
corner
of
Broadway
and
Twenty-seventh
Street
in
company
with
the
Dorvals
Joly
Steinberg
and
Julian
Story
Now
all
dead
except
the
two
Dorvals
who
manage
the
park
Casino
Walter
Damrosch
with
Charles
A
Ellis
gave
a
season
of
German
opera
which
proved
its
recrudescence
Like
his
father
Leopold
Damrosch
he
brought
back
Wagner
to
a
city
sick
with
musical
frivolities
and
futilities
as
Sir
Thomas
Beecham
is
doing
now
at
Drury
Lane
London
He
also
permitted
us
to
hear
Ma
terna
Klafsky
who
looked
like
a
cook
but
sang
like
one
of
the
choirs
of
Cherubim
and
Gadski
Materna
Winck
lemann
and
Scaria
we
had
heard
and
seen
they
were
palpable
physically
speaking
in
concert
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighties
Shrewd
as
they
were
Abbey
Schoeffel
Grau
were
more
than
once
confronted
by
bankruptcy
No
wonder
What
company
before
or
after
could
boast
such
a
lyric
firmament
Think
of
the
names
a
gal
axy
a
constellation
as
the
passionate
press-agent
Philip
Hale
s
phrase
wrote
in
those
halcyon
days
Imperious
Lilli
Lehmann
who
had
come
over
from
the
Stanton
forces
for
a
period
the
greatest
dramatic
so
prano
in
Italian
as
well
as
German
roles
of
them
all
Jean
and
Edouard
de
Reszke
Scalchi
she
had
four
dis
tinct
tone-productions
Melba
beautiful
Emma
Eames
Nordica
Calve
Victor
Maurel
Plangon
Lassalle
and
in
one
season
My
brain
positively
goes
giddy
at
the
sight
of
Les
Huguenots
all
stars
programme
Luigi
Manci
nelli
among
other
conductors
held
his
own
The
consulship
of
Heinrich
Conried
was
not
during
rny
critical
bailiwick
He
will
go
down
in
musical
his
tory
as
the
man
who
defied
the
fulminations
of
Baireuth
and
produced
Parsifal
for
the
first
time
outside
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
Thuringian
Graal
His
Salome
production
with
Alfred
Hertz
conducting
and
he
is
a
sympathetic
conductor
of
Richard
Strauss
would
have
been
a
musical
event
of
importance
had
it
not
been
for
the
notoriety
of
the
affair
Our
music-critics
all
sober
God-fearing
men
with
imaginations
devoid
of
the
mor
bid
or
salacious
were
thrown
into
a
tumult
by
Philip
Hale
who
called
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
Salome
was
a
degenerate
suffering
from
a
rare
and
beautiful
case
as
the
diagnosticians
say
of
necrophilia
No
one
ever
heard
of
the
disease
except
madhouse
doctors
or
readers
of
Krafft-Ebing
and
the
poetry
of
Maurice
RoIIinat
The
conjunction
of
Oscar
Wilde
s
name
com
pleted
the
havoc
A
scandal
ensued
Unhappy
Olive
Fremstad
never
sang
so
overwhelmingly
as
at
that
Sun
day
morning
s
full-dress
rehearsal
Her
apostrophe
to
the
papier-mache
head
of
John
the
Baptist
on
a
prop
erty
charger
set
moralists
gloating
Here
was
a
chance
to
get
back
at
haughty
Richard
Strauss
who
had
dared
to
flout
local
criticism
The
opera
was
withdrawn
Anne
Morgan
the
daughter
of
J
Pierpont
Morgan
was
shouldered
with
the
responsibility
although
she
has
fre
quently
disavowed
the
soft
impeachment
always
going
to
hear
Salome
when
Oscar
Hammerstein
revived
it
with
wonderful
Mary
Garden
as
the
sweet-scented
hero
ine
Philip
Hale
must
have
smiled
more
than
once
at
the
effect
on
our
unsophisticated
souls
of
his
verbal
fire
brand
There
is
no
more
degeneracy
in
the
magnifi
cent
outburst
of
savage
exultation
and
poignant
passion
of
Salome
over
the
head
of
the
Baptist
than
in
Isolde
s
loving
lament
over
Tristan
his
too
is
a
dead
skull
The
real
neurotic
in
the
sloppy
little
play
a
parody
of
Flaubert
s
Herodiade
is
the
King
Since
then
Sa
Jome
has
become
a
commonplace
But
that
last
song
is
the
most
intense
in
all
musical
literature
When
he
wrote
it
not
without
the
aid
of
Richard
Wagner
Strauss
was
a
genius
I
came
to
New
York
in
1886
and
found
the
American
Opera
Company
in
full
swing
with
Jeannette
M
Thurber
on
the
managerial
side-saddle
and
Theodore
Thomas
at
the
musical
helm
And
that
is
history
a
history
full
of
heart-burnings
bankers
Charles
E
Locke
and
other
bobos
inseparable
from
operatic
infancy
That
Theodore
Thomas
by
all
odds
the
most
satisfying
con
ductor
of
symphony
that
America
then
had
and
our
supreme
educational
force
was
at
his
happiest
in
opera
I
can
t
say
Like
Toscanini
he
was
a
martinet
with
his
forces
but
unlike
the
great
Italian
conductor
he
was
too
rigid
in
his
beat
for
the
singers
My
darling
recollection
of
the
Metropolitan
Opera
House
is
that
of
the
first
Tristan
and
Isolde
I
pawned
my
winter
overcoat
to
buy
a
seat
in
the
top
gallery
it
was
the
first
seat
first
row
to
the
right
But
it
was
worth
a
hundred
coats
to
hear
Lehmann
with
SeidI
conducting
When
I
told
Maurice
Egan
our
Ambassador
to
Denmark
for
many
years
then
an
editor
always
a
poet
of
the
episode
he
was
in
despair
saying
that
people
don
t
do
such
things
even
for
art
s
sake
At
his
home
I
met
Henry
George
and
played
for
him
a
Single
Tax
March
on
the
theme
of
his
then
celebrated
book
with
the
assistance
of
Chopin
it
was
a
funeral
march
Earlier
at
the
opera
I
had
heard
Patti
in
Carmen
not
any
worse
than
Lehmann
s
gyp
sy
and
Signer
Perugini
Johnny
Chatterton
in
private
life
as
Alfredo
in
Traviata
his
solitary
appearance
I
believe
With
the
advent
of
German
opera
the
now
familiar
head
of
Victor
Herbert
popped
up
among
the
violoncelli
in
the
orchestra
he
was
then
the
husband
of
Theresa
Herbert
Foerster
a
handsome
Viennese
woman
who
sang
with
a
sumptuous
voice
in
Goldmark
s
Queen
of
Sheba
Marcella
Sembrich
I
had
first
heard
in
Paris
and
after
wards
in
Philadelphia
about
1884
She
belongs
to
the
great
and
almost
vanished
generation
of
vocal
goddesses
Milka
Ternina
an
Isolde
and
Brunhilde
without
parallel
has
left
the
lyric
stage
Calve
still
sings
I
heard
her
in
vaudeville
I
swear
that
my
eyes
were
wet
There
were
holes
in
her
voice
but
the
magnetism
as
of
old
What
a
night
was
that
first
Carmen
of
hers
She
chucked
tradition
to
the
winds
also
her
lingerie
Some
of
the
elder
critics
are
still
blushing
I
recall
a
certain
hot
morning
in
August
1892
when
I
was
hurriedly
sum
moned
by
Manager
Edmund
C
Stanton
to
the
Metro
politan
rather
to
an
eruption
of
fire
for
the
stage
and
the
rear
of
the
house
were
burning
Otto
Weil
now
with
the
present
management
stood
with
Rudolph
and
Albert
Aronson
on
the
roof
of
the
Casino
and
watched
the
flare-up
I
was
luckier
After
the
worst
had
passed
I
stood
in
a
parterre-box
with
Mr
Stanton
and
looked
at
the
blazing
pit
which
had
been
the
stage
Tongues
of
flame
yellowish-red
still
licked
the
edges
of
the
prosce
nium
and
I
expected
to
hear
the
magic
fire-music
of
the
Valkyries
Wo
tan
was
fire
chief
but
Loki
had
fairly
vanquished
him
Where
the
Knickerbocker
Theatre
now
is
was
Luehr
s
Cafe
and
with
a
few
of
the
house
staff
Thomas
Bull
among
the
rest
we
discussed
the
de
pressing
outlook
for
the
forthcoming
operatic
season
There
was
none
1892-1893
was
a
closed
season
not
the
first
that
had
gone
up
in
smoke
The
Luehr
s
hostelry
saw
many
musical
faces
during
the
Stanton
regime
Report
hath
it
that
Isolde
Lehmann
rushed
the
growler
from
the
hotel
across
the
street
I
think
she
was
then
the
wife
of
the
tenor
Paul
Kalisch
I
was
Mr
Stanton
s
private
secretary
at
the
National
Conservatory
of
Music
where
he
was
Mrs
Thurber
s
Secretary
I
spelled
my
job
with
a
small
s
and
as
two
hired
men
we
hit
it
off
capitally
He
was
first
and
last
the
typical
clubman
Tall
distinguished
in
bearing
he
never
lost
his
equilibrium
even
when
verbally
assaulted
by
irate
lyrical
ladies
Once
at
a
rehearsal
after
Lehmann
had
protested
in
an
eloquent
manner
about
the
dusty
stage
and
said
that
it
was
like
a
latrine
he
calmly
replied
in
his
homespun
German
Frau
Leh
mann
Sie
sind
nicht
sehr
lady-like
This
drove
her
to
fury
and
her
retort
froze
my
blood
It
was
both
an
invitation
and
a
menace
Stanton
never
winced
Sa
luting
the
prima
donna
he
left
the
auditorium
Even
the
imperturbable
SeidI
smiled
But
Stanton
was
not
the
man
to
lead
a
forlorn
operatic
hope
If
Abbey
Schoeffel
Grau
couldn
t
who
could
Certainly
not
Conried
Gatti-Casazza
seems
to
have
solved
the
prob
lem
But
he
has
subventions
and
Caruso
He
also
had
Arturo
Toscanini
who
I
am
sorry
to
say
is
in
Italy
He
belongs
to
the
Brahmin
conductors
to
the
company
of
Richter
Levi
SeidI
MottI
Mahler
A
more
poeti
cally
intense
Tristan
than
his
reading
with
the
lovely
Olive
Fremstad
as
the
impassioned
Isolde
I
have
seldom
heard
Toscanini
is
a
superman
In
that
frail
frame
of
his
there
is
enough
dynamic
energy
with
which
to
cap
ture
Gehenna
He
is
all
spirit
He
does
not
always
achieve
the
ultimate
heights
as
did
SeidI
as
does
Arthur
Nikisch
While
his
interpretation
of
Tristan
is
a
wonderfully
worked-out
musical
picture
yet
the
elemen
tal
ground-swell
which
Anton
SeidI
summoned
from
the
vasty
deep
is
missing
But
what
ravishing
tone-colours
Toscanini
mixed
on
his
orchestral
palette
I
saw
much
of
SeidI
His
profile
was
sculptural
So
was
his
manner
But
a
volcano
beneath
He
was
a
taciturn
man
He
smoked
to
distraction
I
ve
often
seen
him
with
Antonin
Dvorak
the
Bohemian
composer
at
the
old
Vienna
Bakery
Cafe
next
to
Grace
Church
There
the
coffee
and
pastry
were
the
best
in
town
The
conductor
and
composer
would
sit
for
hours
without
speaking
It
was
SeidI
who
introduced
the
New
World
Symphony
by
Dvorak
Nahan
Franko
told
me
that
SeidFs
hair
was
originally
red
till
he
dyed
it
and
Fred
Schwab
asserted
that
he
was
a
Jew
I
only
know
that
SeidFs
hair
was
iron-grey
and
that
he
had
studied
for
the
priesthood
at
Budapest
His
expression
was
emi
nently
ecclesiastical
He
never
seemed
a
happy
man
to
me
His
wife
in
the
eighties
was
pretty
and
fresh-col
oured
a
Teutonic
blonde
also
an
admirable
singer
As
Seidl-Krauss
she
was
a
member
of
the
Metropolitan
Opera
House
and
I
recall
her
Eva
in
The
Master
singers
with
pleasure
It
was
rumoured
that
the
great
Hungarian
conductor
had
been
in
love
with
an
equally
celebrated
Wagnerian
singer
in
the
Neumann
company
years
before
His
Gothic
head
I
ve
seen
in
mediaeval
tryptichs
as
a
donator
at
Bruges
or
Ghent
or
else
among
the
portraits
of
Holbein
His
shell
was
difficult
to
pierce
but
once
penetrated
his
friends
found
a
very
warm-hearted
human
Of
Rafael
Joseffy
I
can
only
say
this
I
loved
the
man
as
well
as
the
artist
He
was
that
rara
avis
a
fair
minded
musician
He
never
abused
a
rival
but
for
pre
sumptuous
mediocrity
he
had
a
special
set
of
needles
steeped
in
ironic
acid
Pst
A
phrase
and
the
victim
collapsed
the
wind
escaping
from
his
pretensions
like
a
pricked
toy-balloon
His
touch
his
manner
of
attack
on
the
keyboard
spiritualised
its
wiry
timbre
the
harsh
inelastic
unmalleable
metallic
tone
inseparable
from
the
music
made
by
conventional
pianists
became
under
his
magic
fingers
floating
transparent
evanescent
His
plastic
passage-work
so
different
from
Liszt
s
wrought
iron
figuration
or
the
sonorous
golden
blasts
of
Rubin
stein
his
atmospheric
pedalling
and
gossamer
arabesques
you
ask
in
desperation
if
Joseffy
played
the
piano
what
instrument
then
did
his
contemporaries
play
With
a
few
exceptions
he
made
the
others
seem
a
trifle
obvious
De
Pachmann
Godowsky
Paderewski
were
his
favourite
artists
To
him
alone
may
they
be
compared
Chopin
s
style
must
have
been
according
to
reports
like
the
pianissimist
Vladimir
de
Pachmann
s
That
Russian
was
extraordinary
though
his
playing
never
had
the
intellect
nor
the
brilliancy
of
Joseffy
s
Ah
the
beauty
of
Jo
seffy
s
hands
with
their
beautiful
weaving
motions
those
curved
birdlike
flights
symbolic
of
the
music
One
night
at
Liichow
s
sitting
with
Ed
Ziegler
August
Himself
Joseffy
and
De
Pachmann
an
argument
was
started
De
Pachmann
who
had
been
especially
irritable
turned
vi
cious
and
spitting
out
his
rage
he
was
a
feline
person
he
called
Joseffy
an
unprintable
name
Before
Joseffy
could
answer
the
villainous
attack
I
with
a
recklessness
un
usual
for
me
let
the
Chopinzee
have
the
contents
of
my
glass
full
in
the
face
If
I
had
been
sitting
closer
I
would
have
slapped
his
mouth
as
it
was
the
wetting
might
cleanse
it
Sputtering
he
was
led
away
by
a
waiter
and
presently
returned
smiling
as
if
nothing
had
happened
Joseffy
was
disgusted
with
me
as
well
he
might
be
It
was
unpardonable
my
conduct
and
I
promptly
apolo
gised
Then
De
Pachmann
explained
it
was
jealousy
as
I
had
mentioned
Joseffy
s
name
seven
times
more
he
gave
the
exact
figure
than
his
in
my
Chopin
book
It
sounded
childish
but
it
dissolved
the
disagreeable
business
into
laughter
After
all
had
gone
away
except
Ziegler
Jo
sefFy
turned
to
me
and
severely
reproached
me
but
ended
his
sermon
thus
And
you
of
all
men
wasted
such
a
lot
of
good
beer
I
can
recall
the
diabolic
twinkle
in
his
eye
yet
I
always
had
a
strong
affection
for
the
Poles
and
Poland
I
fancy
it
was
the
Celtic
streak
in
me
which
spells
romantic
If
Poland
and
Ireland
and
women
were
free
what
a
dull
world
this
would
be
excuse
the
metre
although
you
may
well
ask
free
for
what
Jane
Porter
s
sentimental
hero
Thaddeus
of
Warsaw
was
my
first
introduction
to
the
Sarmatian
theme
Chopin
my
next
and
Joseph
Conrad
is
the
latest
incarnation
though
he
seems
less
Polish
than
his
compatriots
because
his
fiction
deals
with
exotic
countries
yet
rightfully
under
stood
he
is
au
fond
as
Polish
as
Mickiewiez
or
Pader
ewski
For
a
decade
and
more
three
Polish
singers
Marcella
Sembrich
the
De
Reszkes
a
Polish
actress
Modjeska
and
a
Polish
piano
virtuoso
Jan
Ignace
Pad
erewski
ruled
here
in
their
respective
spheres
When
Jean
de
Reszke
left
us
his
admirers
believed
he
would
never
be
replaced
nor
has
he
been
There
is
but
one
Jean
Not
being
born
with
a
tenor
voice
he
midway
in
his
mortal
life
made
himself
one
He
thought
tenor
as
an
indispensable
proceeding
in
transforming
his
bary
tone
into
tenor
It
was
not
merely
an
affair
of
altitudi
nous
tones
but
of
timbre
To
be
an
emerald
the
jewel
must
first
think
itself
one
This
is
not
Transcendental
Mysticism
pardon
the
seeming
tautology
but
a
trait
well
understood
in
biology
for
while
a
man
can
not
add
one
cubit
to
his
stature
the
giraffe
elongated
its
neck
to
get
its
daily
nourishment
and
with
the
will-power
and
genius
of
a
Jean
de
Reszke
a
barytone
might
presumably
become
a
tenor
There
was
naturally
material
to
work
upon
Jean
had
vocal
wealth
in
his
throat
though
not
a
multi-millionaire
like
Enrico
Caruso
and
he
had
vocal
brains
an
artistic
intellect
He
born
a
barytone
with
a
high
range
will
be
remembered
in
operatic
history
as
the
most
fascinating
tenor
in
French
or
German
opera
As
voice
and
little
else
is
demanded
in
the
old-fashioned
Italian
repertory
he
did
not
shine
with
the
same
lustre
but
as
Faust
or
Tristan
Romeo
or
Siegfried
Raoul
Jean
of
Leyden
Don
Jose
Romeo
Lohengrin
who
has
left
in
the
memories
of
his
auditors
such
lovable
images
The
nobility
of
his
attitude
towards
art
his
dramatic
assumption
of
the
various
roles
his
personal
pulchritude
these
were
important
factors
but
beyond
all
these
was
the
enigmatic
the
magnetic
fluid
that
envelops
certain
men
and
women
an
aura
one
word
is
as
useless
as
another
in
explaining
this
and
also
enveloping
the
audi
torium
Jean
de
Reszke
possessed
the
nameless
quality
in
such
abundance
that
he
had
only
to
appear
and
there
was
light
His
entrance
in
Lohengrin
the
arrested
attitude
and
without
opening
his
mouth
he
became
the
Swan
Knight
in
our
imagination
There
is
the
word
Jean
was
the
most
imaginative
operatic
singer
of
our
times
poetically
tenderly
exquisitely
imaginative
This
supersubtle
Pole
employed
the
entire
battery
of
his
forces
he
was
not
one
of
those
distressing
tenors
who
tickle
the
ear
of
the
groundlings
He
invested
a
character
with
all
its
attributes
Oh
yes
he
could
take
a
high
C
he
often
did
in
Faust
and
Siegfried
but
such
tricks
did
not
appeal
to
him
Once
at
the
Albemarle
Hotel
I
heard
him
sing
in
the
trio
from
William
Tell
with
his
brother
Edouard
and
Jean
Lassalle
Jean
sang
a
high
C
sharp
from
the
chest
without
straining
I
tell
you
he
thought
C
sharp
for
singing
of
all
musical
achieve
ments
is
primarily
thought
He
was
one
of
the
rare
tenors
who
was
both
virile
and
musical
Does
Wagner
write
vocally
That
question
be
came
superfluous
after
hearing
the
De
Reszkes
Leh
mann
Ternina
Fremstad
Fischer
Nordica
Eames
and
Plangon
Wagner
would
have
died
of
enthusiasm
if
he
could
have
heard
his
essentially
melodic
line
brought
into
high
relief
by
these
artists
The
ancient
Baireuth
vocal
tradition
did
not
quite
satisfy
the
composer
mighty
as
were
its
effects
Niemann
almost
voiceless
was
an
in
comparable
Siegmund
and
Tristan
in
Meyerbeer
despite
his
histrionic
genius
he
could
not
gloss
over
his
vocal
deficiencies
And
there
was
a
long
list
of
large
ladies
barrel-shaped
with
iron
lungs
and
a
method
of
acting
which
consisted
in
waddling
and
brandishing
aloft
their
pudgy
fists
only
that
and
nothing
more
One
we
re
member
I
christened
the
Foghorn
of
Hoboken
because
if
the
wind
was
propitious
an
easterly
wind
and
all
s
well
you
could
hear
her
in
the
heart
of
Hobo
ken
Her
husband
too
had
a
Hoboken
thirst
The
last
time
I
saw
the
unfortunate
couple
was
at
Baireuth
I
asked
Schumann-Heink
the
news
of
the
husband-bary
tone
Madame
Ernestine
never
minces
her
words
Last
night
they
were
fished
out
of
the
gutter
fighting
It
was
true
The
barytone
once
sang
Hans
Sachs
at
the
Metropolitan
to
an
obbligato
of
hiccups
Poor
chap
he
went
down
on
a
steamer
off
the
Hook
of
Holland
He
was
doomed
to
a
liquid
death
I
mention
this
particular
case
not
as
representative
but
as
illustrative
of
certain
characteristics
in
the
old-fashioned
Wagnerian
school
of
singing
and
acting
These
singers
had
tradition
under
standing
and
musical
ability
but
they
sang
by
main
strength
as
the
Irishman
played
the
fiddle
Seldom
was
there
plangency
in
their
tones
Lilli
Lehmann
had
first
mastered
Italian
music
she
had
been
a
coloratura
soprano
singing
in
such
roles
as
the
Queen
in
Hugue
nots
or
Filina
in
Mignon
We
actually
heard
and
saw
her
as
Filina
So
she
brought
to
Wagner
s
music
vocal
perfections
though
she
never
altogether
cured
herself
of
that
glottis-stroke
coup
de
glotte
which
however
she
could
at
certain
moments
make
so
dramati
cally
effective
her
imploring
accents
when
on
bended
knees
Brunhilde
asks
her
father
Wotan
if
her
disobedi
ence
is
irrevocably
unforgiven
This
mannerism
and
a
certain
hardness
in
style
are
the
only
defects
I
can
pick
out
in
the
dazzling
artistic
cuirass
of
her
career
She
was
too
stormy
in
the
first
act
of
Tristan
oh
that
desper
ate
invocation
after
the
curtain
rises
when
Wagner
steals
the
thunder
of
Chopin
s
C
minor
Revolutionary
Etude
and
she
was
not
voluptuously
tender
in
Act
II
But
in
the
last
scene
Lilli
was
glorious
precisely
at
the
point
where
Milka
Ternina
her
superior
in
the
previous
acts
failed
to
reach
the
vocal
summit
Fremstad
s
Isolde
is
largely
modelled
after
her
teacher
s
but
it
is
more
tender
and
womanly
and
in
the
garden
more
poetic
and
lov
able
There
was
always
a
little
of
the
remote
goddess
Brunhilde
in
Lehmann
s
impersonation
of
Isolde
though
curious
to
relate
her
scene
with
Wotan
in
the
third
act
of
The
Valkyrs
was
most
human
most
moving
In
consistencies
are
the
very
web
of
an
artist
s
conception
Max
Alvary
looked
a
Siegfried
but
sang
it
in
a
harsh
pinched
voice
That
didn
t
hinder
him
from
becoming
a
matinee
idol
like
Caruso
to-day
There
was
a
tug-of
war
between
mobs
of
girls
when
he
left
the
Thirty-ninth
Street
door
of
the
Opera
House
The
son
of
an
Achen
bach
one
of
the
Diisseldorf
school
of
glazed
oil-cloth
painters
he
was
personally
a
man
of
breeding
and
hand
some
But
he
could
eat
more
at
a
sitting
than
Michael
Cross
or
the
huge
basso
Lablache
whose
feats
as
a
trencherman
were
Brobdignagian
yet
Alvary
kept
his
figure
though
I
don
t
doubt
that
his
appetite
caused
the
stomach
cancer
from
which
he
died
Among
the
men
of
the
Grau
regime
Edouard
de
Reszke
Plangon
and
Vic
tor
Maurel
were
pre-eminent
I
don
t
suppose
there
is
to
be
found
in
musical
annals
a
versatility
in
aptitudes
as
that
displayed
by
the
French
barytone
Victor
Maurel
Or
if
this
claim
is
lacking
in
historical
perspective
then
I
shall
put
the
question
this
way
Is
there
an
actor
on
any
stage
to-day
who
can
portray
both
the
grossness
of
Falstaff
and
the
subtlety
of
lago
Making
necessary
allowance
for
the
different
art
medium
that
the
singing
actor
must
work
in
and
despite
the
larger
curves
of
pose
and
gesture
Maurel
kept
astonishingly
close
to
the
char
acters
he
assumed
His
Falstaff
was
the
most
wonderful
I
ever
saw
Billy
Burton
and
the
elder
Hackett
were
not
in
my
time
Tree
s
Falstaff
was
a
Jack-pudding
in
an
inflated
life-saver
I
think
that
Mr
Wenman
s
he
came
here
with
Irving
Falstaff
and
Sir
Toby
Belch
were
the
best
assumptions
for
I
can
t
recall
my
old
friend
George
Giddens
in
these
parts
which
he
must
play
superlatively
well
But
Maurel
from
what
school
or
schools
is
he
the
crystallised
product
His
voice
worn
and
siccant
nevertheless
could
take
on
any
dramatic
colouring
desired
In
Verdi
s
Falstaffo
it
was
bullying
blandishing
defiant
tender
and
gross
charged
with
an
impure
suggestiveness
and
as
jolly
as
a
boon
compan
ion
s
When
he
sang
the
scherzo
Quand
ero
paggio
del
duca
di
Norfolk
the
lightness
of
touch
brought
back
boyish
horizons
And
the
soliloquy
what
eloquence
And
this
fat
knight
whose
corpulence
and
lechery
and
unction
were
conveyed
to
us
not
by
such
obvious
sym
bols
as
padding
or
leering
or
belching
but
were
in
the
very
larynx
of
Maurel
would
without
the
wave
of
an
enchanter
s
wand
become
overnight
the
sinuous
lean
and
treacherous
lago
The
two
most
satisfying
lagos
I
remember
were
Henry
Irving
s
and
Edwin
Booth
s
and
the
first
shall
be
last
Victor
Maurel
s
paralleled
them
at
every
point
Admitted
that
the
singing
height
ens
the
impression
but
in
reality
weakens
the
characteri
sation
yet
Maurel
s
lago
never
betrayed
a
tendency
towards
the
melodramatic
he
held
a
middle
course
as
difficult
as
treading
on
eggs
without
crushing
them
and
was
both
a
picture
and
a
dramatic
happening
Malig
nant
he
was
that
is
the
fat
of
the
part
but
he
under
lined
the
reason
for
his
sinister
actions
lago
is
begin
ning
to
be
less
the
spirit
that
denies
than
a
human
with
a
sound
motive
for
revenge
I
know
you
will
re
mind
me
that
critical
whitewashing
is
become
the
fashion
that
Nero
Simon
Magus
Judas
Iscariot
Bene
dict
Arnold
are
only
getting
their
just
dues
at
the
hands
of
various
apologists
De
Quincey
you
remember
said
that
without
Judas
the
drama
of
Jesus
crucified
would
not
have
occurred
Nero
was
a
much
abused
monster
though
Renan
believes
him
to
be
the
Beast
mentioned
in
the
Apocalypse
it
seems
now
there
were
no
atroci
ties
during
the
fabulous
persecutions
of
the
Jews
and
Christians
and
Arnold
well
he
was
of
British
descent
that
may
have
accounted
for
much
But
in
the
case
of
I
ago
there
is
something
to
be
said
A
pure
devil
as
we
conceive
devils
to
be
he
was
not
A
rough
hard
drinking
soldier
he
admits
he
is
and
to
call
his
put
money
in
thy
purse
cynical
is
to
contravene
all
worldly
wisdom
No
Othello
had
wronged
him
and
he
hated
him
for
it
hated
his
wife
for
her
infidelity
therefore
his
revenge
is
credible
It
is
its
method
that
revolts
lago
is
a
Machiavelli
in
action
and
Desdemona
perfectly
innocent
is
crushed
between
the
upper
and
lower
mill
stones
of
inexorable
destiny
This
is
not
meant
to
be
an
essay
on
the
esoteric
meanings
of
Shakespeare
but
merely
the
result
of
studying
MaureFs
conception
who
painted
the
portrait
of
Othello
s
Ancient
not
all
black
but
with
many
gradations
and
nuances
We
used
to
make
fun
Steinberg
and
I
of
what
was
called
the
psychological
crook
of
lago
s
left
knee
yet
not
a
movement
but
meant
something
Maurel
was
economical
in
gesture
His
was
true
objective
characterization
His
Don
Giovanni
was
another
finely
painted
character
He
was
the
live
courtly
quick
to
take
offense
amorous
intriguing
brave
cruel
and
superstitious
His
drinking
song
was
vocal
virtuosity
in
its
best
estate
And
there
is
a
catalogue
of
other
roles
such
as
De
Nevers
Amonasro
which
need
not
detain
us
Suffice
to
say
that
Verdi
entrusted
to
him
the
task
of
originating
such
widely
sundered
roles
as
lago
and
Falstaff
Tall
handsome
athletic
a
boxer
of
skill
Maurel
in
private
life
was
not
unlike
his
Don
Juan
of
the
footlights
Innumerable
are
the
anecdotes
related
of
his
conquests
Women
in
society
deserted
hearth
and
husband
for
him
If
there
were
Elviras
there
were
Annas
and
Zerlinas
also
Merry
Wives
Once
these
merry
ladies
plotted
a
surprise
for
Falstaff
in
St
Louis
Letters
brimming
with
passionate
protestations
were
sent
to
the
Fat
Knight
and
fairly
drove
him
to
distraction
as
they
all
made
a
ren
dezvous
for
the
same
hour
though
in
different
parts
of
the
city
He
drove
from
spot
to
spot
but
the
merry
wives
failed
to
keep
their
appointments
They
saw
him
They
were
in
ambush
and
their
laugh
was
longer
than
at
Herne
s
Oak
But
the
Knight
never
roared
nor
betrayed
a
sign
of
defeat
Perhaps
he
knew
Had
Eames
Scalchi
Melba
or
Calve
hatched
the
conspiracy
against
his
happiness
I
ll
never
tell
One
thing
I
do
know
Maurel
interested
women
even
those
who
de
claimed
loudest
against
his
philandering
I
saw
a
pho
tographic
nude
of
him
posed
as
a
boxer
It
was
as
Greek
as
if
the
figure
had
been
modelled
by
some
classical
sculptor
A
picturesque
figure
of
a
man
In
his
best
years
Maurel
was
an
inspiring
swell
On
Fifth
Avenue
of
a
fine
day
he
was
to
be
seen
with
his
retinue
He
swaggered
He
was
the
Great
Lover
to
the
life
Sur
rounded
by
his
secretaries
his
pugilist
his
fencing-master
his
pianist
and
a
lot
of
singers
he
was
an
event
on
the
Avenue
One
could
have
said
some
fantastic
Italian
Prince
of
the
Renaissance
who
had
strayed
into
the
nine
teenth
century
To-day
at
three
score
and
ten
he
is
still
the
Grand
Seigneur
and
seldom
misses
a
first
night
at
the
Metropolitan
A
friend
of
mine
a
young
American
painter
first
saw
the
object
encircling
the
robust
throat
of
Victor
Maurel
at
the
opera
Standing
in
the
auditorium
during
the
entr
acte
talking
to
the
French
portraitist
Theobald
Chartrain
the
great
singer
faced
the
audience
He
wore
evening
clothes
did
Maurel
like
any
other
private
citizen
It
was
his
collar
that
riveted
the
glance
of
my
friend
the
painter
Such
a
collar
Such
a
shape
archaic
mediaeval
exotic
altogether
fascinating
for
stu
dents
of
costumes
of
historic
periods
It
was
a
low
turnover
collar
the
points
close
its
height
inconsiderable
indeed
so
low
that
the
throat
of
the
singer
was
exposed
Nearer
the
observer
noted
that
two
gold
pins
were
care
lessly
thrust
into
either
side
of
the
linen
These
pins
evoked
Byzantine
luxury
Puzzled
by
the
odd
architec
ture
yet
fearful
of
appearing
rude
the
painter
devoured
this
collar
with
hungry
eyes
Then
retreating
to
the
lobby
he
made
a
pencilled
sketch
from
memory
upon
his
cuff
But
he
questioned
his
memory
Where
had
he
seen
just
such
a
cryptic
pattern
From
what
storehouse
of
pictures
had
the
barytone
drawn
his
model
The
Prado
the
National
Gallery
The
Louvre
And
from
whom
There
is
a
Bronzino
there
a
warrior
in
black
armour
over
the
hauberk
of
which
flows
a
point
lace
creation
No
not
Bronzino
Botticelli
Da
Vinci
Ve
lasquez
Aha
He
had
it
A
Hyacinthe
Rigaud
also
the
simulacrum
of
an
armoured
warrior
from
whose
neck
peeps
a
low
reversed
collar
with
close
points
two
jewelled
stick
pins
speared
through
the
sides
He
had
his
Maurel
now
He
too
could
command
his
phoenix
among
col
lars
And
he
did
He
continued
commanding
for
years
He
spent
his
inheritance
on
shirt-makers
He
dissipated
the
considerable
legacy
of
an
aunt
He
went
abroad
He
became
known
to
London
haberdashers
In
Paris
he
was
called
M
le
Col
He
was
the
King
of
Collars
But
his
pursuit
of
the
infinite
was
in
vain
Though
he
dragged
an
artist
skilled
in
the
facture
of
collars
before
the
Rigaud
portrait
at
the
Louvre
yet
did
he
fail
to
ex
tort
from
his
plastic
genius
the
desired
perfection
The
collar
The
collar
Almost
beggared
he
dragged
his
weary
soul
back
to
New
York
His
brush
for
want
of
practice
had
lost
its
cunning
and
he
was
forced
to
earn
a
living
by
photography
One
day
he
saw
M
Maurel
on
the
Avenue
With
a
rapidly
beating
heart
the
painter
feverishly
stared
at
the
neck
of
the
Frenchman
He
fled
despair
counselling
suicide
The
singer
was
wear
ing
a
high-standing
monstrosity
with
flaring
points
No
gold
stick
pins
A
life
had
been
wasted
in
search
of
an
impossible
ideal
The
tragedy
is
all
the
more
poig
nant
because
the
unhappy
young
fanatic
for
significant
form
did
not
know
that
whenever
Maurel
changed
the
style
of
his
neck
linen
he
was
traversing
a
new
psychic
emotional
tempest
the
symbol
of
which
he
bravely
dis
played
to
curious
impertinents
Ah
the
collar
the

THE
DE
RESZKES
AND
PADEREWSKI
Edouard
de
Reszke
was
a
splendid
man
yet
not
the
finished
vocal
artist
that
was
Pol
Plancon
That
French
man
despite
his
mincing
gait
and
meticulous
methods
could
melt
the
heart
of
a
wooden
Indian
naturally
he
was
best
in
French
and
Italian
roles
though
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
him
deliver
with
faultless
finish
the
music
of
Wagner
He
like
the
De
Reszkes
was
an
imposing
figure
on
and
off
the
boards
But
virility
was
absent
though
in
La
Navarraise
that
noisy
little
piece
of
Massenet
and
in
company
with
Emma
Calve
he
was
a
soldier
every
inch
of
him
And
his
Mephistos
Gounod
s
and
Boito
s
were
masterpieces
of
characterisation
Edouard
however
had
dramatic
temperament
With
what
sonorous
abandon
he
sang
the
Veau
d
or
or
the
Piff-Paff
The
first
night
of
Romeo
and
Juliet
he
was
the
Friar
Laurence
Fames
with
Jean
de
Reszke
as
the
lovers
The
music
is
sentimental
pastry
the
French
from
Voltaire
to
Gounod
have
never
grasped
Shakespeare
but
with
such
singers
even
the
sloppy
music
did
not
veil
the
poetry
and
pathos
of
the
interpretation
Jean
often
sang
the
role
with
Nellie
Melba
as
the
Juliet
yet
for
me
Fames
seemed
the
ideal
Juliet
Edouard
was
a
big
good-natured
Mephisto
and
a
satisfying
King
Mark
When
the
brothers
lived
at
the
old
Gilsey
House
I
occa
sionally
visited
them
and
witnessed
some
performances
of
Edouard
in
the
eternal
Italian
opera
called
Spaghetti
Living
as
they
did
so
many
years
in
Italy
their
favourite
cuisine
was
the
Italian
Why
should
I
fill
up
on
soup
Edouard
would
ask
A
dinner
should
begin
with
a
pasta
and
his
always
did
Eating
nothing
before
they
sang
their
midnight
meal
was
a
spectacle
that
would
have
driven
a
dyspeptic
frantic
The
spaghetti
was
lit
erally
wheeled
into
the
room
and
disappeared
like
snow
under
the
rays
of
a
mellow
sun
Years
later
at
Warsaw
I
met
their
brother
Victor
de
Reszke
who
owned
one
of
the
principal
hotels
in
the
Polish
city
He
boasted
a
genuine
tenor
voice
a
lyric
tenor
and
being
a
De
Reszke
also
a
musical
temperament
He
told
me
inter
alia
that
a
singer
should
not
eat
much
but
he
added
they
always
do
He
meant
Edouard
even
Jean
became
too
stout
when
he
abandoned
opera
his
voice
was
far
from
being
worn
He
could
have
lasted
ten
years
but
that
spaghetti
In
Paris
I
heard
Josephine
de
Reszke
his
sister
at
the
opera
She
sang
with
consummate
taste
The
advent
of
Paderewski
was
the
most
sensational
since
Joseffy
s
and
Rubinstein
s
He
took
the
town
by
storm
His
first
rehearsal
occurred
one
afternoon
in
and
resembled
the
drawing
by
Edward
Burne-Jones
He
was
the
very
flowering
of
the
type
beloved
of
the
Pre
raphaelite
painter
He
played
with
orchestra
the
C
minor
concerto
of
Saint-Saens
musically
empty
work
but
a
favourite
warhorse
of
Leschetizky
pupils
why
I
can
t
say
the
G
minor
concerto
is
of
more
musical
value
I
attended
that
rehearsal
not
only
because
I
was
curious
to
hear
the
young
Polish
virtuoso
but
for
the
reason
that
I
had
to
write
two
criticisms
of
the
concert
which
was
to
take
place
the
evening
of
the
next
day
one
for
The
Musical
Courier
the
other
for
the
New
York
Recorder
a
new-born
daily
newspaper
of
which
I
was
musical
editor
Of
course
I
raved
over
Paddy
and
wrote
a
prose
poem
A
Study
in
Old
Gold
or
some
such
affected
title
I
was
suffering
from
preciousness
and
a
rush
rhapsody
to
the
pen
I
was
earnest
however
in
my
admiration
of
Jan
Ignace
who
painted
with
a
golden
romantic
brush
whose
style
was
poetic
manly
musical
In
Paris
he
had
unannounced
made
a
deep
impression
with
the
Schumann
concerto
He
had
substituted
for
his
friend
and
preceptor
Annette
Essipova
one
of
Leschetizky
s
wives
and
a
pianist
of
the
first
rank
She
was
indisposed
quite
conveniently
and
the
unknown
youth
had
his
first
hearing
and
pleased
a
critical
audi
ence
His
subsequent
triumphs
are
history
I
may
add
that
as
a
man
artist
and
patriot
Premier
Jan
Ignace
Paderewski
is
altogether
remarkable
His
general
cul
ture
is
wide
his
modesty
most
engaging
and
he
has
heart
enough
to
free
Poland
if
heart
alone
counted
Not
witty
in
the
sense
that
Rosenthal
or
Joseffy
were
witty
his
is
the
profoundest
nature
of
the
three
The
mag
netism
which
overflows
the
auditorium
when
he
plays
is
the
same
in
his
impassioned
appeals
for
the
succour
of
his
unhappy
land
He
is
the
reincarnation
of
Thaddeus
of
Warsaw
or
the
Pan
Tadeusz
of
Mickiewicz
In
certain
Chopin
compositions
I
have
never
heard
his
peer
notably
in
the
F
minor
concerto
but
then
he
plays
all
schools
with
amazing
versatility
But
Schu
mann
and
Chopin
are
his
favourites
I
have
preserved
a
telegram
he
sent
me
bearing
the
date
February
19
kindly
do
me
the
favour
to
act
as
judge
in
prize
competi
tion
for
American
composers
in
April
Please
reply
to
Vendome
Theatre
Nashville
I
accepted
and
that
was
the
last
I
heard
of
the
matter
evidently
he
hadn
t
apprised
the
other
judges
I
ve
forgotten
who
they
were
and
I
ve
also
forgotten
the
winners
of
the
prize
I
fancy
my
connection
with
The
Musical
Courier
did
not
please
the
members
of
the
jury
and
I
confess
I
wasn
t
sorry
Such
competitions
seldom
bring
forth
fruit
nevertheless
I
told
Paderewski
but
he
only
smiled
in
Polish
At
one
period
I
saw
much
of
him
heard
him
play
fragments
from
his
unpublished
Polish
Fantasy
for
piano
and
he
made
me
the
proposal
for
me
to
edit
a
projected
musical
journal
in
London
He
was
to
furnish
the
capital
I
refused
I
was
too
much
enamoured
of
New
York
in
1892
and
its
multitudinous
attractions
This
refusal
I
now
regret
I
asked
Paderewski
about
the
Burne
Jones
sketch
He
said
that
when
he
first
visited
London
probably
in
1889
or
1890
he
was
riding
in
a
bus
and
facing
him
was
an
elderly
artistic-looking
man
who
stared
at
him
in
a
most
embarrassing
fashion
When
the
pianist
alighted
the
other
followed
and
asking
his
pardon
gave
him
a
card
It
was
Sir
Edward
Burne
Jones
then
celebrated
and
Paderewski
with
his
accus
tomed
amiability
accepted
the
invitation
of
the
painter
to
pose
for
him
It
is
the
one
head
of
his
that
I
like
The
flaming
locks
the
intense
spiritual
life
that
marked
the
mask
of
the
Pole
must
have
been
an
inspiration
to
the
Englishman
who
has
in
a
large
composition
shown
us
Vivien
and
Merlin
and
for
the
enchanter
enchanted
by
the
woven
paces
of
the
siren
he
took
Liszt
as
the
model
Paderewski
s
head
fascinated
him
NORDICA
AND
FREMSTAD
Nordica
never
impressed
me
as
a
genius
as
did
Leh
mann
Ternina
and
Fremstad
She
had
not
much
emo
tional
draught
She
was
not
temperamental
in
their
sense
Her
voice
too
sweet
as
it
was
never
thrilled
She
was
not
a
Brunhilde
born
nor
could
she
sound
all
the
notes
of
Isolde
s
tragic
octave
But
she
had
charm
and
before
she
entered
the
Felia
Litvinne
class
of
operatic
heavy-weights
she
was
pleasant
to
gaze
upon
towards
the
end
of
her
career
she
looked
like
a
large
heavily
upholstered
couch
She
was
a
slow
study
but
stub
bornly
industrious
and
underwent
the
torture
of
one
thousand
piano
rehearsals
before
she
ventured
to
sing
Isolde
At
the
last
one
her
faithful
accompanist
became
so
enthusiastic
over
her
singing
that
he
expressed
it
in
unmistakable
masculine
style
A
furious
chase
ensued
and
Nordica
after
dodging
her
adorer
finally
slipped
out
of
the
room
She
told
me
the
story
with
such
realism
that
I
asked
her
why
she
troubled
herself
about
such
a
little
thing
as
a
kiss
and
her
reply
was
truly
feminine
He
had
been
eating
garlic
And
he
was
not
an
Italian
nor
a
Frenchman
Of
Olive
Fremstad
I
may
only
say
that
whatever
critical
reservations
one
may
make
as
to
her
performance
of
Isolde
or
Brunhilde
her
Brangaene
and
Sieglinde
were
the
most
satisfying
to
the
eye
and
ear
I
ever
experienced
Her
Brangaene
was
a
dazzling
young
witch
and
not
the
plain
maid-of-all-work
8
STEEPLEJACK
we
usually
see
and
hear
her
Sieglinde
was
a
creature
compact
of
love
and
pathos
and
vocally
wonderful
When
Fremstad
as
a
girl
sang
in
a
Valkyrs
chorus
led
by
SeidI
at
a
concert
hall
Madison
Avenue
corner
Fifty-ninth
Street
about
1890
she
was
very
pretty
and
her
blonde
hair
an
aureole
you
recalled
the
exclamation
of
that
Pope
who
on
seeing
some
English
youth
pris
oners
said
Non
Angli
sed
Angeli
At
Baireuth
the
American
girl
was
one
of
the
Rhine
Daughters
this
was
to
Nordica
s
Isolde
at
the
inauguration
of
the
Prince
Regent
s
Opera
House
and
she
is
my
only
agreeable
artistic
memory
in
a
performance
that
was
enlivened
by
the
Isolde
Nordica
falling
across
the
Tristan
in
the
garden
scene
and
as
both
were
corpulent
there
was
a
silent
scramble
watched
with
immense
sympathy
by
a
corpulent
audience
Madame
Fremstad
s
artistic
career
has
been
all
her
early
critics
prophesied
I
spoke
a
moment
ago
of
Felia
Litvinne
She
was
the
sister
of
Edouard
de
Reszke
s
wife
a
Canadian
born
I
believe
and
the
sister
of
Willy
Schutz
Madame
Litvinne
was
an
excellent
operatic
soprano
She
sang
Isolde
to
Jean
de
Reszke
s
Tristan
She
was
also
blonde
and
very
stout
Edouard
said
that
it
was
mere
turn
of
the
wrist
for
her
to
eat
a
two-pound
box
of
sweetmeats
at
a
single
sitting
He
remonstrated
with
her
so
did
her
women
friends
but
to
no
avail
Her
brother
Willy
was
indignant
when
he
related
his
struggles
with
her
She
always
swallowed
the
chocolates
before
he
could
grab
them
she
said
that
he
wanted
them
for
himself
It
may
have
been
so
Willy
was
a
joyous
character
He
would
have
made
the
ideal
prima
donna
s
husband
the
kind
that
hunts
the
Metropolitan
lobby
during
en
tr
actes
who
conducting
you
to
a
corner
whispers
Hein
Now
what
you
think
My
wife
she
knocks
fifty
hells
out
of
that
stupid
Museria
The
stupid
one
is
the
rival
prima
donna
of
course
If
you
cheerfully
acquiesce
you
are
immediately
piloted
across
the
street
to
the
chop
house
On
account
of
such
husbands
of
prima
donnas
both
Max
Hirsh
and
William
J
Guard
acquired
their
grey
hair
Willy
Schutz
never
attempted
to
conceal
his
admiration
and
love
for
Nordica
He
must
have
pro
posed
to
her
at
least
twice
a
week
I
was
in
his
company
on
the
terrace
of
the
Monferino
Cafe
Paris
when
the
startling
news
reached
us
that
Nordica
had
married
the
Hungarian
Zoltan
Doeme
whose
real
name
is
Solomon
Teitlbaum
He
sang
Parsifal
at
Baireuth
only
once
I
was
present
So
was
Nordica
Yet
she
married
him
This
marriage
proved
almost
fatal
to
Willy
He
had
fetched
from
New
York
the
pet
French
poodle
of
Madame
Nordica
It
was
a
fetish
for
Willy
He
and
the
dog
dis
appeared
for
a
week
after
the
news
from
America
and
when
next
he
turned
up
the
pup
which
had
been
snow
white
was
dyed
black
and
around
its
woolly
neck
it
wore
a
huge
crepe
bow
On
its
tail
another
emblem
It
was
the
palpable
expression
of
Willy
s
sorrow
The
cocottes
on
the
terrace
set
up
a
wail
of
commiseration
Oh
la
belle
Toutou
he
has
lost
his
maman
The
history
was
pretty
well
canvassed
and
with
the
senti
mental
sympathy
of
their
class
That
night
Willy
Schutz
was
a
hero
who
had
been
jilted
by
a
heartless
coquette
He
positively
sobbed
as
he
looked
at
the
canine
in
mourn
ing
but
the
dog
didn
t
seem
to
mind
it
Poor
Willy
he
was
not
very
strong
above
the
eyes
but
he
was
tender
hearted
and
he
meant
well
but
his
waistcoat
was
so
heavily
paved
with
good
intentions
that
he
waddled
His
dog
Nordica
s
forsaken
animal
reminds
me
of
the
epitaph
I
made
for
a
Mexican
hairless
pup
one
of
those
shivering
tiny
brutes
that
yaps
and
snarls
at
every
stranger
It
was
prized
by
Adelina
Patti
who
forced
her
visitors
to
kiss
its
snout
When
it
passed
away
dur
ing
some
ineffable
indigestion
I
wrote
this
for
its
tomb
stone
Requiesdog
in
Patti
Henderson
then
of
The
Times
said
my
Latin
was
faulty
but
you
can

OSCAR
HAMMERSTEIN
Well
I
remember
the
first
day
that
the
late
Oscar
Ham
merstein
entered
The
Musical
Courier
office
and
intro
duced
himself
He
told
Marc
Blumenberg
that
he
was
worth
a
million
dollars
made
by
some
patent
cigar-cutting
machine
He
was
also
the
editor
of
a
trade-journal
de
voted
to
the
tobacco
industry
Blumenberg
looked
at
me
and
shook
his
head
Meshugah
You
think
I
am
said
the
future
impresario
I
ll
show
you
I
m
not
crazy
He
produced
proofs
A
millionaire
he
cer
tainly
was
and
Marc
became
interested
Who
wouldn
t
Oscar
was
dreaming
of
opera
in
English
The
failures
of
the
American
opera
had
only
blazed
the
trail
for
him
He
saw
that
cheap
prices
and
good
singing
in
our
native
language
would
solve
the
problem
There
was
much
pow-wowing
which
didn
t
intrigue
me
as
the
less
I
under
stand
of
operatic
speech
the
more
I
enjoy
the
music
Yet
as
Harry
B
Smith
has
truthfully
remarked
When
the
opera
is
a
success
the
composer
gets
the
credit
when
a
failure
the
blame
is
inevitably
saddled
on
the
librettist
As
the
librettist
of
Robin
Hood
and
a
string
of
De
Koven
successes
Mr
Smith
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
W
S
Gilbert
was
in
the
same
rocking
boat
with
Arthur
Sullivan
Later
Oscar
Hammerstein
was
to
set
tle
the
question
by
writing
the
words
and
music
of
his
opera
The
Kohinoor
But
at
first
he
was
rather
timid
I
don
t
believe
he
took
Blumenberg
s
advice
or
the
advice
of
anyone
Opera
at
the
Harlem
Opera
House
followed
It
was
not
enlivening
I
recall
the
burning
mountain
in
Auber
s
Masaniello
or
the
Dumb
Girl
of
Portici
and
the
various
burning
thirsts
of
i2^th
Street
Naught
else
But
Oscar
was
not
a
man
easily
discour
aged
He
played
the
game
with
energy
and
recklessness
Strictly
speaking
he
was
a
gambler
born
Organising
opera
companies
vaudeville
shows
at
the
old
Victoria
for
example
erecting
opera
houses
in
New
York
and
Philadelphia
and
London
playing
with
men
and
millions
what
were
the
achievements
of
Henry
E
Abbey
or
Col
Jack
Haverly
compared
with
this
shrewd
ever
witty
good-tempered
Hebrew
who
was
as
prodigal
with
his
own
money
as
the
others
were
with
the
capital
of
strangers
Hammerstein
s
original
operetta
was
as
celebrated
as
the
Hammerstein
hat
It
was
the
result
of
a
wager
made
between
Oscar
and
Gustave
Kerker
the
composer
of
The
Belles
of
New
York
Castles
in
the
Air
and
a
dozen
popular
operettas
Gus
an
excellent
musician
was
skeptical
concerning
the
ability
of
Hammerstein
At
a
table
in
the
cafe
of
the
old
Gilsey
House
sat
Hammer
stein
Kerker
the
late
Charles
Alfred
Byrne
dramatic
critic
of
The
Journal
and
librettist
of
Castles
in
the
Air
which
employed
the
talents
of
De
Wolf
Hopper
Tom
Sea
brooke
and
Delia
Fox
Henry
Neagle
dramatic
editor
of
The
Recorder
and
myself
Oscar
becoming
excited
offered
to
compose
an
opera
words
and
music
in
forty
eight
hours
Kerker
took
him
up
The
thing
became
serious
Rooms
were
engaged
on
the
top
floor
of
the
Gilsey
an
upright
piano
installed
and
cut
off
from
the
outer
world
Hammerstein
began
fingering
out
his
tunes
writing
words
putting
them
all
on
paper
I
forgot
to
add
that
Gus
Kerker
agreed
to
arrange
the
music
for
orchestra
We
had
lots
of
fun
Louis
Harrison
engaged
a
relay
of
hand-organs
to
play
under
the
composer
s
windows
but
Oscar
never
winced
plates
of
sinister
ham
sandwiches
were
sent
to
his
room
accompanied
by
cock
tails
And
the
tray
was
returned
empty
with
many
thanks
I
ve
forgotten
all
the
pranks
we
played
to
no
purpose
Complaints
were
made
by
sundry
guests
at
the
office
that
a
wild
man
was
howling
and
thumping
the
keyboard
again
uselessly
for
barricaded
the
stub
born
composer
refused
to
give
up
the
fort
Exhausted
but
still
smiling
he
invited
the
jury
on
awards
to
listen
to
his
music
It
proved
a
tuneful
hodge-podge
as
might
have
been
expected
and
Kerker
threw
up
the
sponge
The
opera
was
actually
produced
at
the
New
York
Theatre
a
few
months
later
reinforced
by
extra
numbers
and
considerably
edited
and
it
met
with
suc
cess
That
first
night
of
The
Kohinoor
was
a
notori
ous
one
also
side-splitting
The
audience
of
the
true
Tenderloin
variety
laughed
themselves
blue
in
the
face
I
remember
that
the
opening
chorus
consumed
a
third
of
the
first
act
Oscar
knew
the
art
of
camouflage
before
the
word
was
invented
Two
comic
Jews
alternately
for
a
half-hour
sang
Good
morning
Mr
Morgenstern
Good
morning
Mr
Isaacstein
while
the
orchestra
shifted
the
harmonies
so
as
to
avoid
too
much
monotony
I
fancy
that
was
a
Kerker
device
Oscar
composed
a
second
operetta
but
it
never
achieved
the
popularity
of
the
first
During
a
certain
period
the
Hammerstein
hat
was
without
a
duplicate
except
that
worn
by
William
M
Chase
the
painter
However
the
Hammerstein
hat
was
unique
not
alone
for
the
grey
matter
it
covered
but
be
cause
of
its
atmospheric
quality
It
was
a
temperamental
barometer
When
the
glass
had
set
fair
the
tilt
of
the
hat
was
unmistakable
If
storm-clouds
gathered
on
the
vocal
horizon
the
hat
felt
the
mood
and
righted
itself
like
a
buoy
in
agitated
waters
Its
brim
settled
over
the
eyes
of
the
impresario
His
people
scurried
into
anonymous
corners
Or
the
hat
was
pushed
off
his
forehead
unbut
toned
then
his
soul
You
could
approach
and
ask
for
seats
A
weather
gauge
was
Oscar
s
hat
What
a
brim
Oh
the
breadth
and
flatness
thereof
How
glossy
its
nap
in
height
how
amiable
To
have
described
Hammerstein
without
his
hat
would
be
to
give
the
ring
without
Wotan
Shorn
of
it
the
owner
would
have
been
like
Alberich
sans
tarnhelm
As
an
Irishman
would
say
his
hat
was
his
heel
of
Achilles
He
was
said
to
wear
it
while
sleeping
if
he
ever
slept
Inside
was
stencilled
the
wisdom
of
Candide
II
faut
cultiver
notre
Jardin
Mary
of
course
Many
painters
have
yearned
to
portray
that
hat
on
Oscar
s
dome
of
action
The
Impressionists
would
paint
its
comple
mentary
tones
the
late
William
M
Chase
would
have
transformed
it
into
a
shiny
still-life
George
Luks
would
make
it
a
jest
of
Hades
while
Arthur
B
Davies
would
turn
it
into
a
symbol
the
old
Hebraic
chant
Kol
Nidrei
might
be
heard
echoing
about
its
curved
surfaces
as
echoes
the
Banshee
on
a
funereal
night
in
Tipperary
It
was
a
hat
cosmopolitan
joyous
alert
both
reticent
and
expansive
It
caused
a
lot
of
people
sleepless
nights
this
sawed-off
stovepipe
with
its
operatic
airs
Why
did
Oscar
Hammerstein
wear
it
For
the
same
reason
that
the
miller
wore
his
hat
and
not
for
tribal
or
other
reasons
ANTONIN
DVORAK
It
was
Rafael
Joseffy
who
introduced
me
to
Mrs
Jeannette
M
Thurber
This
energetic
and
public
spirited
lady
who
accomplished
more
by
her
failures
than
other
people
s
successes
met
with
an
enormous
amount
of
critical
opposition
when
she
started
the
Ameri
can
opera
movement
Some
of
her
opponents
would
have
liked
to
mount
the
band
wagon
and
failing
abused
her
audacity
But
she
had
the
right
idea
which
was
the
French
one
She
first
founded
a
National
Con
servatory
in
1
88

where
musical
talent
was
welcomed
and
tuition
free
There
was
a
theatre

application
with
Emy
Fursch-Madi
Victor
Capoul
Emil
Fischer
M
Dufriche
Jacques
Bouhy
and
other
famous
opera
sing

and
teachers
wherein
the
rudiments
of
acting
and
vocal
delivery
could
be
mastered
What
a

of

comprised

was

were

this

which
was
then
located
on
Seven

east
of
Irving
Place
Well
I
remember
the
day
that
I
begged
Harry
Rowe
Shelley
the
Brooklyn
organist
to
submit
his
compositions
to
Dvorak
later
he
became
one
of
the
pupils
of
that
master
some
of
the
others
were
Rubin
Goldmark
nephew
of
the
famous
composer
himself
one
of
the
most
gifted
among
our
younger
Americans
Harvey

Henry

the

lectures
in
the
National
Con
servatory
at
its
new
building
on
the
West
Side
I
taught
piano
classes
twice
weekly
for
ten
years
and
in
addition
was
the
press
representative
of
the
Conservatory
and
secretary
to
the
Secretary
Mr
Stanton
and
after
he
died
I
was
a
secretary
to
Mrs
Thurber
my
chief
duty
being
a
daily
visit
at
her
residence
where
I
sat
for
an
hour
and
admired
her
good
looks
She
was
a
pic
turesque
woman
Gallic
in
her
allures
but
more
Span
ish
than
French
in
features
She
spoke
French
like
a
Parisian
and
after
thirty
years
I
confess
that
her
fine
dark
eloquent
eyes
troubled
my
peace
more
than
once
But
I
only
took
it
out
in
staring
Curiously
to
relate
Mrs
Thurber
has
changed
but
little
a
grey
lock
or
two
which
only
makes
her
more
picturesque
than
ever
Old
Borax
as
Dvorak
was
affectionately
called
was
handed
over
to
me
by
Madame
Thurber
when
he
arrived
He
was
a
fervent
Roman
Catholic
and
I
hunted
a
Bo
hemian
church
for
him
as
he
began
his
day
with
an
early
Mass
Rather
too
jauntily
I
invited
him
to
taste
the
American
drink
called
a
whisky
cocktail
He
nodded
his
head
that
of
an
angry
looking
bulldog
with
a
beard
He
scared
one
at
first
with
his
fierce
Slavonic
eyes
but
was
as
mild
a
mannered
man
as
ever
scuttled
a
pupil
s
counterpoint
I
always
spoke
of
him
as
a
boned
pirate
But
I
made
a
mistake
in
believing
that
American
strong
waters
would
upset
his
Czech
nerves
We
began
at
Goerwitz
then
described
a
huge
circle
through
the
great
thirst
belt
of
central
New
York
At
each
place
Doc
Borax
took
a
cocktail
Now
alcohol
I
abhor
so
I
stuck
to
my
guns
the
usual
three-voiced
invention
hops
malt
and
spring
water
We
spoke
in
German
and
I
was
happy
to
meet
a
man
whose
accent
and
grammar
were
worse
than
my
own
Yet
we
got
along
swimmingly
an
ap
propriate
enough
image
for
the
weather
was
wet
though
not
squally
He
told
me
of
Brahms
and
that
composer
s
admiration
for
Dvorak
I
agreed
with
Brahms
Dvorak
had
a
fresh
vigorous
talent
was
a
born
Impressionist
and
possessed
a
happy
colour
sense
in
his
orchestration
His
early
music
was
the
best
he
was
an
imitator
of
Schubert
and
Wagner
and
never
used
quotation
marks
But
the
American
theory
of
native
music
never
appealed
to
me
He
did
and
dex
terously
use
some
negro
or
alleged
negro
tunes
in
his
New
World
Symphony
and
in
one
of
his
string
quar
tets
but
if
we
are
to
have
true
American
music
it
will
not
stem
from
darky
roots
especially
as
the
most
original
music
of
that
kind
thus
far
written
is
by
Stephen
Foster
a
white
man
The
influence
of
Dvorak
s
Ameri
can
music
has
been
evil
ragtime
is
the
popular
pabulum
now
I
need
hardly
add
that
the
negro
is
not
the
original
race
of
our
country
And
ragtime
is
only
rhythmic
motion
not
music
The
Indian
has
more
pretensions
musically
as
E
A
MacDowell
has
shown
in
his
Suite
for
Orchestra
This
statement
does
not
impeach
the
charm
of
the
African
music
made
by
Harry
Burleigh
I
only
wish
to
emphasise
my
disbelief
in
the
fine-spun
theories
of
certain
folk-lorists
MacDowell
is
our
most
truly
na
tive
composer
as
an
Alsatian-born
is
now
our
most
potent
American
composer
His
name
is
Charles
Martin
Loeffler
and
he
shared
the
first
desk
of
the
violins
in
the
Boston
Symphony
Orchestra
with
Franz
Kneisel
a
noble
artist
I
mention
Loeffler
lest
we
forget
But
Borax
I
left
him
swallowing
his
nineteenth
cocktail
Master
I
said
rather
thickly
don
t
you
think
it
s
time
we
ate
something
He
gazed
at
me
through
those
awful
whiskers
which
met
his
tumbled
hair
half-way
Eat
No
I
no
eat
We
go
to
a
Hous
ton
Street
restaurant
You
go
hein
We
drink
the
Slivavitch
It
warms
you
after
so
much
beer
I
didn
t
go
that
evening
to
the
East
Houston
Street
Bohemian
cafe
with
Dr
Antonin
Dvorak
I
never
went
with
him
Such
a
man
is
as
dangerous
to
a
moderate
drinker
as
a
false
beacon
is
to
a
shipwrecked
sailor
And
he
could
drink
as
much
spirits
as
I
could
the
amber
brew
No
I
assured
Mrs
Thurber
that
I
was
through
with
piloting
him
When
I
met
Old
Borax
again
at
Sokel
Hall
the
Bohemian
resort
on
the
East
Side
I
deliberately
dodged
him
I
taught
one
class
which
was
nicknamed
in
dark
est
Africa
because
all
the
pupils
were
coloured
I
con
fess
a
liking
for
negroes
possibly
because
of
my
child
hood
days
spent
in
Maryland
They
are
very
human
very
musical
their
rhythmic
sense
remarkable
I
had
a
talented
pupil
named
Paul
Bolin
who
also
studied
organ
with
Heinroth
and
another
Henry
Guy
whose
piano
talent
was
not
to
be
denied
I
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
this
pupil
play
Mendelssohn
s
Cappriccio
Brillante
in
B
minor
with
an
orchestra
conducted
by
Gustav
Hinrichs
well
known
to
Philadelphians
for
his
pioneer
work
there
in
opera
Both
these
young
men
are
now
professionals
and
like
the
many
hundreds
educated
at
the
National
Conservatory
are
earning
their
living
in
a
dignified
manner
What
Mrs
Thurber
has
done
for
the
negro
alone
will
I
hope
be
credited
to
her
account
in
any
history
of
the
coloured
race
Her
musical
activi
ties
are
still
unabated
In
1891
Congress
granted
her
school
a
charter
and
the
privilege
of
conferring
the
degree
of
musical
doctorship
With
the
war
over
the
National
Conservatory
should
by
right
of
precedent
and
by
reason
of
the
vast
good
accomplished
in
the
mu
sical
world
since
1881
be
made
a
national
institution
So
mote
it
be
STEINWAY
HALL
Old
Steinway
Hall
on
East
Fourteenth
Street
where
it
is
at
present
was
my
favourite
rendezvous
It
was
the
musical
centre
of
the
city
William
Steinway
high
in
political
councils
was
a
genuine
philanthropist
He
assisted
struggling
talent
He
had
his
hand
a
charitable
one
in
every
enterprise
of
musical
moment
A
generous
hearty
forthright
man
His
chief
aid
was
Charles
F
Tretbar
in
charge
of
the
artistic
section
of
the
hall
Mr
Tretbar
managed
visiting
pianists
and
helped
to
organise
such
orchestral
concerts
as
those
given
by
Theo
dore
Thomas
and
the
Boston
Symphony
Orchestra
It
was
in
Steinway
Hall
that
I
first
heard
the
band
from
Boston
Gericke
conductor
and
Kneisel
concert-master
I
was
fresh
from
the
orchestra
of
the
Paris
Conservatoire
but
it
couldn
t
hold
a
candle
to
Boston
s
pride
One
rival
it
had
still
has
the
Vienna
Philharmonic
which
I
last
heard
in
1913
under
Felix
Weingartner
As
for
piano
recitals
they
rained
on
you
even
in
those
days
every
body
played
the
piano
well
as
Felix
Leifels
has
truthfully
observed
It
was
there
I
heard
Karl
Klindworth
play
Chopin
but
I
preferred
his
masterly
edition
of
the
mas
ter
s
music
to
his
personal
performance
A
giant
then
was
Edmund
Neupert
the
Norwegian
to
whom
Edvard
Grieg
dedicated
his
A
minor
concerto
because
it
is
said
Neupert
composed
for
it
that
massive
cadenza
in
the
first
movement
Certainly
no
one
before
or
since
inter
preted
the
work
as
did
Neupert
and
I
heard
Grieg
him
self
in
London
Neupert
s
eyes
were
so
large
liquid
and
luminous
that
Madame
Alice
Garrigue-Mott
hinted
a
sum
mer
chalet
might
have
been
built
on
their
edge
Come
on
in
the
water
s
fine
He
had
an
orchestral
style
and
he
was
to
be
found
nightly
at
Maurer
s
or
the
Hotel
Liszt
Think
of
a
Liszt
Hotel
on
Fourteenth
Street
Truly
a
musical
neighbourhood
Later
it
reminded
me
of
the
hotels
and
apartment
houses
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Hispanic
Museum
in
Audubon
Park
founded
by
Archer
M
Huntington
At
every
turn
you
read
such
names
as
Velasquez
Goya
Murillo
or
El
Greco
Steinway
Hall
was
once
the
resort
of
our
crowd
com
posed
of
Harry
Rowe
Shelley
Harry
Orville
Brown
Henry
Junge
John
Kuehl
Joseffy
Fiiedheim
Max
Bendix
Victor
Herbert
and
when
in
town
the
witty
Moriz
Rosenthal
It
was
in
Steinway
Hall
at
a
Thomas
concert
I
heard
JosefFy
strike
a
false
note
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
my
life
and
of
all
concertos
the
E
minor
was
the
one
he
played
the
best
The
arpeggio
after
the
opening
chords
he
rolled
to
the
top
but
didn
t
strike
the
E
I
remember
Theodore
Thomas
staring
at
the
back
of
the
little
virtuoso
as
if
he
thought
him
insane
If
burning
glances
could
have
slain
JosefFy
would
have
died
on
the
stage
that
afternoon
But
it
didn
t
disturb
him
I
heard
Rubinstein
make
a
slip
at
one
of
his
his
torical
concerts
but
with
magnificent
nonchalance
he
took
as
a
point
of
departure
the
false
note
at
the
top
and
rolled
down
the
keyboard
only
to
roll
up
again
in
the
correct
tonality
But
he
wasn
t
playing
with
or
chestra
A
PRIMA
DONNA
S
FAMILY
About
1888
the
general
character
of
New
York
began
to
change
The
foreign
influx
had
become
accelerated
Barn-like
structures
invaded
the
residential
section
along
the
Avenue
strange
tribes
crowded
the
native
off
the
sidewalk
And
that
was
thirty
years
ago
To-day
we
are
living
in
an
Asiatic
metropolis
New
Cosmopolis
I
have
called
it
As
the
old
Knickerbocker
families
have
sold
still
are
selling
their
birthright
no
fault
need
be
found
with
the
present
conquerors
The
melting-pot
which
doesn
t
always
melt
is
rapidly
dimming
hopes
Irving
Place
at
that
time
was
not
the
street
of
tall
build
ings
it
now
is
rows
of
modest
three-story
dwellings
from
Fifteenth
Street
to
Gramercy
Park
were
occupied
for
the
most
part
by
their
owners
and
interspersed
with
comfortable
lodging
or
boarding
houses
The
only
thing
that
hasn
t
suffered
a
change
is
the
sky-line
at
either
end
of
the
street
the
park
on
the
upper
side
and
the
familiar
facade
of
the
restaurant
at
Fourteenth
Street
are
still
there
Unchanged
too
is
Washington
Irving
s
pretty
cottage
at
the
corner
of
Seventeenth
Street
A
block
away
is
Union
Square
Old
Moretti
gave
you
perfect
spaghetti
in
his
original
home
on
Fourteenth
Street
and
Italian
opera
was
heard
at
the
Academy
of
Music
The
golden
age
of
the
cuisine
music
art
and
letters
in
the
old
town
are
gone
never
to
return
For
daily
exercise
I
usually
walked
around
Union
Square
the
park
railings
had
been
removed
but
the
square
was
not
yet
spoiled
by
tramps
or
disfigured
by
shanties
There
were
trees
shady
seats
and
the
sound
of
fountains
Gloomy
busi
ness
lofts
did
not
hem
in
this
park
and
on
summer
eve
nings
it
was
a
favoured
promenade
for
residents
in
the
vicinity
Several
seasons
I
had
noticed
a
ponderous
dame
of
certain
years
and
fantastically
attired
escorted
by
a
tall
elderly
man
with
a
grizzled
beard
and
had
been
informed
that
the
lady
was
a
well-known
singing-teacher
Madame
Miramelli
or
to
give
her
full
title
Miramelli
Mario
The
soldierly
looking
man
was
M
Mario
ex
barytone
and
the
manager
of
his
wife
s
affairs
She
had
a
studio
on
Irving
Place
one
flight
up
the
basement
was
a
Turkish
bath
On
the
two
door-plates
you
read
the
rather
confusing
legend
Miramelli
Vocal
Instruc
tion
and
Baths
Turkish
and
Russian
Downstairs
However
the
numerous
singing
pupils
that
streamed
in
from
eight
A
M
to
six
P
M
didn
t
seem
to
mind
this
jumbling
of
music
and
manners
and
Madame
was
too
busy
to
bother
about
it
Curiously
enough
whenever
I
passed
the
house
her
husband
was
either
entering
or
emerging
He
was
a
busy
man
I
did
not
meet
him
personally
till
later
at
the
old
Belvedere
House
Fourth
Avenue
and
Eighteenth
Street
now
only
a
pleas
ant
memory
It
was
during
luncheon
and
as
we
shared
the
same
table
I
spoke
to
him
about
the
excellent
coffee
He
elevated
his
shoulders
and
in
his
reply
I
found
less
of
the
Italian
and
more
of
the
Slav
than
I
had
expected
from
one
of
his
appearance
He
explained
to
me
that
he
had
spent
twenty
years
at
the
Royal
Opera
Petrograd
We
slipped
into
an
easy-going
acquaintance
and
met
now
at
Riccadonna
s
on
the
Square
or
at
Morelli
s
on
Fifth
Avenue
also
at
Lienau
s
and
Maurer
s
at
the
last
named
resort
for
the
sake
of
the
excellent
wines
The
taste
of
M
Mario
was
cosmopolitan
But
no
matter
his
whereabouts
at
seven
o
clock
every
evening
he
could
be
seen
piloting
his
heavy
wife
around
Union
Square
she
fatigued
though
voluble
he
taciturn
and
melan
choly
They
did
not
create
the
impression
of
a
well
mated
couple
One
day
when
I
had
occasion
to
call
upon
him
the
little
maid
who
opened
the
door
shrew
ishly
responded
to
my
question
Is
M
Mario
at
home
with
You
mean
the
husband
of
Madame
That
threw
some
light
on
their
domestic
relations
and
when
I
saw
him
shovelling
snow
carrying
bundles
and
market
bas
kets
or
running
errands
I
realised
his
subaltern
position
in
the
artistic
partnership
I
was
then
a
music-critic
and
possibly
the
friendly
advances
made
by
M
Mario
were
prompted
by
professional
reasons
Yet
he
never
hinted
that
his
wife
gave
annually
a
concert
at
which
her
pupils
were
supposed
to
distinguish
themselves
He
possessed
tact
was
educated
and
a
linguist
His
clothes
while
not
of
a
fashionable
cut
were
neat
and
clean
Perhaps
M
Mario
did
take
a
drop
too
much
and
too
often
though
I
vow
I
never
saw
him
the
worse
for
it
He
seldom
appeared
at
any
of
his
daily
posts
after
seven
o
clock
so
I
set
him
down
as
an
early
bird
till
one
night
returning
late
from
the
opera
I
saw
him
sitting
on
a
Union
Square
bench
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
It
was
moonlight
I
hesitated
fearing
he
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
Then
I
suddenly
changed
my
mind
I
called
out
Hello
my
friend
What
are
you
doing
up
so
late
He
instantly
arose
and
I
saw
that
he
had
been
weeping
but
was
sober
I
joked
and
invited
him
to
Liichow
s
He
gravely
refused
It
is
this
way
he
said
in
his
strangely
streaked
accent
I
was
warm
and
didn
t
sleep
I
sometimes
worry
I
he
stopped
hesitated
a
moment
then
asked
Couldn
t
you
come
to
Madame
s
to-morrow
morning
say
about
noontime
I
promise
you
a
surprise
A
young
voice
bell-like
with
velvet
added
to
the
crystalline
quality
he
was
strangely
excited
as
are
all
artists
when
a
rare
talent
is
discovered
I
promised
though
I
dislike
hearing
novices
especially
when
the
affair
smacks
of
reclame
But
the
agitation
of
M
Mario
was
unmistakable
his
interest
sincere
and
thinking
that
there
had
been
a
family
row
and
I
could
do
him
a
favour
I
said
yes
and
at
noon
the
next
day
I
passed
the
office
of
the
Turkish
bath
on
the
first
floor
and
reached
the
studio
of
Madame
Miramelli
She
was
at
her
piano
a
battered
instrument
still
ser
viceable
and
she
only
inclined
her
head
on
my
entrance
Evidently
I
was
not
too
welcome
In
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
young
girl
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
She
was
blonde
of
complexion
and
dressed
her
hair
in
foreign
fashion
She
was
indifferently
clad
To
tell
the
truth
I
was
taken
by
her
face
not
so
pretty
as
attractive
Her
features
were
irregular
her
nose
snub
but
her
large
blue
eyes
the
clear
eyes
of
a
congenital
liar
blazed
with
intense
feeling
and
her
mouth
quivered
No
wonder
Madame
Miramelli
had
been
scolding
her
Lyda
she
screamed
a
long
name
followed
Slavic
in
sound
be
ginning
with
the
letter
Z
Lyda
you
sing
like
five
pigs
If
you
sing
thus
to
the
gentleman
I
believe
a
critic
she
lifted
her
savage
old
eyebrows
sardonically
you
will
drive
him
away
As
for
my
beloved
husband
more
pantomime
he
thinks
you
are
to
become
a
second
Gerster
or
Nilsson
Don
t
disappoint
him
for
he
is
the
greatest
living
ex-barytone
and
a
wonderful
judge
She
would
have
continued
this
nasty
railing
tone
if
M
Mario
hadn
t
entered
and
seated
himself
near
the
girl
His
wife
stared
at
him
and
his
eyes
fell
Shrugging
her
fat
shoulders
she
cried
Again
Skip
the
introduction
begin
at
the
aria
She
struck
a
chord
The
girl
looked
entreatingly
at
the
husband
who
literally
trem
bled
his
expression
was
one
of
mingled
fear
and
ad
miration
His
eyes
blazed
too
he
folded
his
arms
and
his
whole
being
was
concentrated
in
his
hearing
The
girl
sang
He
had
not
boasted
her
voice
was
like
a
velvet
bell
She
sang
with
facility
though
her
musical
conception
was
immature
as
might
have
been
expected
Without
doubt
a
promising
talent
When
she
finished
M
Mario
shook
her
by
the
hand
which
limply
fell
as
he
released
it
he
led
her
to
a
seat
and
to
my
pity
and
astonishment
I
saw
that
she
was
lame
sadly
lame
her
gait
was
waddling
almost
ludicrous
so
distorted
was
the
hip
movement
My
gaze
collided
with
the
eyes
of
the
old
woman
at
the
keyboard
and
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
infernal
malice
blended
with
hateful
jealousy
it
was
expressed
by
her
face
She
held
her
silence
and
feeling
the
unbearable
tension
I
said
some
pleasant
conven
tional
words
to
the
timid
girl
bowed
to
Madame
and
left
the
room
M
Mario
accompanied
me
to
the
street
but
did
not
ask
for
further
criticism
though
thanking
me
for
my
kindness
in
giving
so
much
of
my
valuable
time
I
cut
him
short
and
escaped
not
without
notic
ing
the
tears
in
his
eyes
Decidedly
an
emotional
man
or
an
old
fool
too
easily
affected
by
a
pretty
voice
But
the
lameness
maybe
that
had
aroused
his
interest
also
disgusted
him
with
his
wife
s
sharp
tongue
and
un
amiable
demeanour
towards
the
poor
girl
Ah
these
ancient
prima
donnas
and
the
tyrannical
airs
they
as
sume
for
the
benefit
of
their
pupils
and
their
superflu
ous
husbands
The
husband
of
Madame
It
was
a
tragi-comedy
his
yet
why
should
he
become
so
tearful
over
the
lame
girl
with
the
lovely
voice
and
plaintive
eyes
Madame
was
jealous
and
the
girl
wouldn
t
be
treated
any
too
well
because
the
husband
was
sentimental
The
musical
season
had
set
in
and
on
the
wings
of
song
and
symphony
I
was
whirled
away
from
memories
of
Irving
Place
and
the
pupils
of
Madame
Miramelli
Mario
But
as
the
winter
modulated
into
spring
I
occasionally
thought
of
these
people
though
one
warbler
in
the
present
is
worth
a
dozen
in
the
future
It
was
May
before
I
again
saw
M
Mario
He
pretended
not
to
know
me
at
least
it
looked
so
I
was
offended
I
knew
his
odd
habits
In
the
evenings
I
resumed
my
old
walks
about
the
square
more
as
an
appetiser
than
a
diver
sion
Precisely
at
seven
o
clock
the
musical
couple
slowly
moved
through
the
park
I
avoided
them
They
seemed
as
ever
bored
and
I
noted
that
Madame
was
no
longer
loquacious
These
walks
continued
for
a
month
when
one
afternoon
I
found
M
Mario
at
the
fountain
gazing
at
the
water
I
saluted
him
and
was
shocked
by
his
altered
exterior
He
had
thinned
was
neglected
looking
his
linen
not
too
new
and
he
had
a
desperate
air
In
a
stately
style
he
bowed
and
to
my
inquiry
as
to
his
health
he
did
not
reply
Come
and
have
a
drink
I
bade
him
it
will
cheer
you
We
went
across
to
Brubacher
s
cafe
where
they
played
chess
in
those
times
and
I
asked
M
Mario
And
that
girl
with
the
splendid
soprano
is
she
improving
His
eyes
filled
She
is
no
longer
with
us
he
answered
Too
bad
I
commented
She
had
talent
though
I
fancy
her
lameness
would
hurt
her
career
still
there
was
Carlotta
Patti
he
raised
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
supplication
No
he
whispered
she
was
driven
out
of-doors
by
Madame
Mario
I
was
utterly
taken
aback
Driven
away
because
of
petty
jealousy
Then
the
hu
morous
side
struck
me
I
fear
you
are
a
Don
Juan
my
friend
Can
you
blame
your
good
wife
Such
a
handsome
chap
as
you
and
still
dangerous
you
know
He
stopped
me
Say
no
more
caro
amico
the
sub
ject
touches
me
too
closely
Yes
Madame
Mario
is
jealous
That
girl
that
girl
how
shall
I
say
it
My
first
love
she
is
dead
She
was
a
great
dramatic
soprano
a
Russian
and
that
girl
she
is
my
daughter
she
I
was
tremendously
excited
lt
Your
daughter
Now
I
see
it
all
You
see
nothing
he
tersely
replied
I
persisted
But
does
your
wife
know
the
girl
is
yours
He
shook
his
head
and
took
a
sip
of
wine
I
was
puz
zled
After
all
it
was
not
polite
to
put
such
personal
questions
Pardon
me
M
Mario
but
I
can
t
help
feeling
interested
He
pressed
my
hand
We
sat
in
silence
then
he
exclaimed
I
was
crazy
to
bring
the
girl
to
her
I
hoped
for
a
magnificent
artistic
future
No
Madame
Mario
doesn
t
know
she
shall
never
know
She
is
jealous
of
the
girl
s
youth
jealous
of
me
of
my
own
daughter
I
hastily
interposed
Well
why
didn
t
you
tell
her
Why
Why
Because
the
girl
doesn
t
know
it
herself
Because
I
am
a
miserable
coward
afraid
of
my
old
she
devil
Because
He
went
away
without
saying
good-by
leaving
me
in
a
stupefying
fog
of
conjecture
That
evening
for
the
first
time
the
husband
of
Madame
did
not
keep
company
with
her
in
their
promenade
around
old
Union
Square
I
possess
an
indifferent
sense
of
time
the
years
pass
and
leave
little
impress
on
my
spirit
Nevertheless
I
m
sure
I
felt
older
when
on
a
certain
evening
at
Carnegie
Hall
I
awaited
without
undue
impatience
the
debut
of
a
much
advertised
Russian
soprano
Zelocca
or
some
such
name
It
was
to
be
one
of
those
tiresome
mixed
con
certs
in
which
a
mediocre
pianist
violinist
or
tenor
with
bleating
voice
or
an
impossible
buffo-basso
participate
The
only
missing
element
of
horror
on
the
bill
of
fare
was
a
flute
virtuoso
but
flutists
and
harps
as
solo
instru
ments
were
no
longer
in
mode
However
as
a
seasoned
veteran
I
settled
in
my
seat
prepared
for
the
worst
It
came
in
the
shape
of
a
young
woman
who
gave
her
audi
ence
a
dislocated
version
of
the
Chopin
Ballade
in
the
ingratiating
key
of
A
flat
I
regret
to
add
that
she
was
applauded
but
concerts
of
this
sort
are
the
joy
of
the
encore
fiends
who
were
out
in
force
that
evening
The
tenor
sobbed
his
aria
and
then
came
the
bright
star
of
the
entertainment
A
blonde
woman
of
some
distinc
tion
at
least
twenty-eight
years
old
hobbled
over
the
stage
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
accompanist
It
was
Madame
Zelocca
the
greatest
living
exponent
of
col
oratura
singing
I
confess
I
was
neither
intrigued
by
this
managerial
proclamation
nor
by
the
personality
of
the
singer
What
did
interest
me
however
was
the
idea
that
perhaps
Carlotta
Patti
might
have
a
successor
Zelocca
sang
the
Bell
Song
from
Lakme
a
mild
pre
paratory
exercise
to
warm
her
fluty
tones
Yes
it
was
a
marvellous
voice
wide
in
range
of
extraordinary
agility
and
the
timbre
was
of
a
fruity
richness
And
she
sang
as
only
an
accomplished
artist
can
sing
When
she
limped
away
after
applause
hearty
enough
to
awaken
even
the
critics
a
compartment
in
my
memory
flew
open
and
out
popped
the
past
Irving
Place
and
the
white
hard
light
of
a
shabby
music-room
a
lame
girl
singing
in
So
STEEPLEJACK
the
middle
of
the
room
a
sour-faced
foreign
woman
accompanying
her
and
the
most
vivid
impression
a
middle-aged
man
devouring
the
girl
with
a
gaze
in
which
was
equally
mixed
pride
and
humility
It
was
the
protege
of
Madame
Miramelli-Mario
Why
had
I
not
immediately
recognised
this
lame
singer
And
what
was
the
use
of
my
musical
memory
if
I
couldn
t
recall
the
colour
of
this
brilliant
voice
But
a
decade
and
more
had
passed
since
I
first
heard
the
girl
Lyda
now
Madame
or
was
it
Signorina
Zelocca
Much
music
had
filtered
through
the
porches
of
my
ears
since
then
Was
I
to
blame
for
my
short
memory
hush
here
she
is
once
more
For
her
second
number
Zelocca
sang
and
with
astound
ing
bravura
the
famous
aria
from
The
Magic
Flute
followed
it
with
Rossinian
fireworks
and
threw
in
The
Last
Rose
of
Summer
and
Home
Sweet
Home
as
crumbs
of
consolation
for
a
now
frantic
audience
in
a
word
she
played
at
ease
with
the
whole
bag
of
prima
donna
tricks
It
needed
no
prophet
to
tell
us
that
she
was
not
only
a
great
singer
but
also
a
money-maker
of
superlative
possibilities
Pardon
my
cynical
way
of
put
ting
things
The
practice
year
in
year
out
of
musical
criticism
doesn
t
make
a
man
an
idealist
This
young
woman
with
the
opulent
figure
lark-like
voice
and
homely
though
intelligent
face
would
surely
prove
the
successor
of
Carlotta
Patti
lima
di
Murska
and
other
song-birds
with
gold-mines
in
their
throats
But
only
in
the
concert
room
in
opera
her
lameness
would
be
deplor
able
she
floundered
rather
than
walked
Yet
such
was
the
magnetism
of
her
voice
I
pushed
my
way
to
the
corridors
leaving
a
mob
of
lunatics
clustered
about
the
stage
clamouring
for
more
like
true
daughters
of
the
horse-leech
As
the
front
of
the
house
was
impassable
I
tried
to
go
out
by
the
Fifty
sixth
Street
artists
entrance
but
before
I
reached
the
door
I
was
in
a
midst
of
babbling
humanity
Some
sinister
magic
must
lurk
in
music
that
can
thus
trans
form
sensible
men
and
women
into
irresponsible
beings
It
is
called
temperament
but
I
think
it
is
our
quotidian
sensual
souls
out
of
the
loose
Pushed
and
shoved
as
I
was
I
felt
my
arm
grabbed
I
turned
It
was
Mario
but
aged
a
quarter
of
a
century
so
it
seemed
to
me
per
haps
it
was
the
uncertain
light
the
excitement
of
the
moment
perhaps
because
I
hadn
t
seen
him
for
years
His
face
was
full
of
gnarled
lines
his
hair
and
beard
white
his
large
dark
eyes
alone
hinted
at
their
former
vitality
They
burned
with
a
sombre
fire
and
if
ever
a
man
looked
as
if
he
was
standing
on
the
very
hub
of
hell
it
was
poor
old
Mario
Why
hadn
t
I
thought
of
him
earlier
in
the
evening
as
the
father
of
Zelocca
I
whis
pered
vague
congratulations
He
didn
t
hear
me
his
face
was
that
of
a
gambler
who
has
played
his
last
and
lost
Gradually
I
fought
my
way
through
a
phalanx
of
half-crazy
humans
Mario
tugging
at
my
arm
We
found
ourselves
on
Fifty-sixth
Street
and
I
hastened
to
tell
him
the
pleasure
I
had
experienced
adding
And
you
aren
t
you
proud
to
be
her
father
Yes
I
am
proud
His
toneless
voice
surprised
me
I
continued
What
did
she
say
when
she
saw
you
for
you
were
her
first
in
spiration
I
was
her
first
inspiration
This
echo
annoyed
me
Was
the
poor
chap
too
feeble
to
realise
the
triumph
of
his
daughter
Wasn
t
she
glad
to
see
you
I
persisted
He
stopped
under
an
electric
light
and
gave
me
a
bewildered
look
Then
more
explicitly
No
she
wasn
t
glad
I
went
in
after
her
first
aria
which
Madame
Mirainelli-Mario
God
rest
her
soul
he
piously
crossed
himself
taught
her
and
Well
well
I
impatiently
interposed
Well
she
didn
t
know
me
that
s
all
His
voice
trailed
into
ghostly
silence
I
became
indignant
Such
abominable
ingratitude
I
tell
you
the
truth
he
reiterated
She
had
forgotten
me
my
face
my
name
and
as
she
never
knew
I
was
her
father
He
paused
To
the
heavens
I
whistled
my
rage
and
incredulity
Much
must
have
happened
to
her
in
ten
years
She
forgot
sh
forgot
she
is
not
to
blame
only
she
forgot
me
He
slowly
moved
down
Broadway
this
debris
of
a
greal
artist
this
forgot
ten
father
of
a
famous
singer
with
a
convenient
memory
That
night
at
the
office
I
wrote
a
critical
notice
about
his
daughter
Zelocca
which
bristled
with
techni
cal
terms
and
was
bejewelled
with
adjectives
Was
she
not
the
only
living
successor
of
Carlotta
Patti
I
moaned
as
I
thought
of
the
inside
story
of
the
newspaper
beat
I
had
burning
at
the
tip
of
my
tongue
But
I
had
to
play
fair
and
write
about
her
singing
not
of
her
wretched
behaviour
to
the
man
who
had
forwarded
her
on
her
career
The
Welsh
rabbit
I
ate
at
the
Arena
later
did
not
console
my
palate
I
went
to
bed
in
a
wretched
humour
To
go
or
not
to
go
For
hours
I
argued
the
case
before
I
decided
to
accept
the
prettily
worded
invitation
of
La
Zelocca
to
visit
her
some
afternoon
or
to
be
pre
cise
the
afternoon
following
the
arrival
of
her
note
I
dislike
informal
little
calls
upon
prima
donnas
at
hotels
where
you
usually
find
a
chain
of
adorers
managers
press-agents
and
anonymous
parasites
Nevertheless
I
went
up
to
the
Plaza
the
Lord
only
knows
why
Per
haps
my
curiosity
now
aflame
would
be
gratified
per
haps
the
young
woman
might
make
an
excuse
for
her
cold-blooded
behaviour
to
her
abandoned
father
Who
knows
Some
such
idea
was
in
my
mind
when
after
the
pompous
preluding
of
my
presence
I
knocked
at
the
door
of
her
suite
in
the
hotel
She
was
sitting
in
a
com
fortable
room
and
gazing
upon
the
still
green
park
I
begged
of
her
not
to
derange
herself
as
she
made
a
feint
of
rising
and
saluted
her
with
the
conventional
kiss
on
the
hand
I
m
bound
to
acknowledge
a
finely
articulated
well-kept
hand
and
in
return
was
warmly
welcomed
At
close
range
Zelocca
was
handsomer
than
on
the
stage
Her
robust
figure
was
set
off
in
a
well-fitting
street
cos
tume
and
her
shapely
head
had
evidently
been
handled
by
a
discriminating
hair-dresser
We
conversed
of
the
weather
of
the
newspaper
criticisms
mine
in
particular
and
I
ventured
to
ask
her
about
the
box-office
Yes
it
had
pleased
her
better
still
it
had
pleased
her
manager
a
jewel
of
a
man
be
it
understood
She
spoke
in
a
silvery
voice
with
the
cool
assurance
of
a
woman
who
fully
recognised
her
financial
worth
We
drank
tea
in
Russian
fashion
I
saw
my
opening
So
you
were
in
Russia
before
taking
the
western
world
by
storm
Ah
yes
cher
maitre
I
always
bristle
with
importance
when
thus
addressed
I
studied
hard
in
Petrograd
and
benefited
by
my
intimacy
with
the
great
Zelocca
I
was
puzzled
I
am
a
relative
of
hers
you
know
I
took
her
name
by
her
kind
permission
My
mother
gave
me
a
letter
to
her
when
I
left
New
York
She
was
a
friend
of
an
early
friend
of
my
mother
s
husband
Her
mother
Who
the
deuce
is
her
mother
I
asked
myself
My
face
must
have
betrayed
me
for
she
looked
at
me
pensively
her
eyes
were
truly
glorious
with
their
deceptive
frankness
and
murmured
Of
course
M
Mario
must
have
told
you
of
mother
s
death
I
under
stood
She
meant
old
Miramelli-Mario
and
should
have
said
stepmother
I
nodded
as
sympathetically
as
I
could
music-critics
are
sometimes
better
actors
than
the
singers
they
criticise
and
replied
Yes
yes
M
Mario
told
me
But
you
say
Zelocca
still
lives
He
said
to
me
if
I
remember
aright
that
she
was
dead
years
ago
She
seemed
startled
at
this
news
He
told
you
that
Ah
the
miserable
I
jumped
at
the
chance
But
my
dear
lady
he
is
after
all
your
father
and
if
I
guess
the
truth
your
mother
in
Russia
has
proved
your
best
friend
I
mean
your
real
mother
She
harshly
interrupted
My
real
mother
was
a
she
devil
This
sounded
like
the
daughter
of
Mario
And
she
angrily
pursued
she
treated
me
as
if
I
were
a
kitchen-maid
The
dramatic
manner
in
which
this
speech
was
delivered
left
no
doubt
as
to
its
sincerity
Again
I
was
at
sea
She
poured
a
torrent
of
words
into
my
ears
My
father
that
old
drunken
beast
my
father
If
you
only
knew
the
truth
How
an
artiste
must
suffer
before
she
drags
herself
out
of
the
mire
It
was
a
vile
swamp
that
home
of
mine
on
on
She
paused
for
want
of
the
name
On
Irving
Place
I
interposed
Yes
Irving
Place
That
Mario
was
not
my
father
he
was
only
the
husband
of
Madame
and
she
she
was
I
m
ashamed
to
say
it
my
true
mother
La
Bella
Zelocca
covered
her
face
with
her
eloquent
hands
while
her
shoulders
sobbed
if
her
throat
did
not
I
was
flabbergasted
by
this
unexpected
this
absurd
revelation
What
sort
of
a
deviPs
dance
had
I
been
led
what
kind
of
a
sinister
impasse
had
I
reached
She
con
tinued
her
face
still
hidden
A
cruel
unnatural
mother
a
still
crueller
stepfather
he
never
ceased
his
per
secutions
And
I
was
too
young
too
timid
too
much
in
fear
of
my
jealous
mother
who
soon
found
out
what
was
going
on
That
s
why
she
was
so
disagreeable
the
day
you
called
She
got
rid
of
me
soon
after
that
I
was
packed
off
to
Russia
to
her
sister
Oh
didn
t
I
tell
you
that
the
other
Zelocca
is
my
aunt
No
She
is
and
a
kinder
woman
than
was
my
mother
Now
you
know
why
I
wouldn
t
see
the
old
rascal
who
expected
to
live
on
me
as
he
had
lived
on
the
bounty
of
two
sisters
why
why
But
I
felt
that
my
presence
was
becoming
indecorous
in
this
close
atmosphere
of
family
scandal
I
arose
seized
my
hat
She
sat
bolt
upright
stiff
as
a
votive
candle
her
expression
was
one
of
annoyed
astonishment
Surely
you
are
not
going
so
soon
and
not
going
with
out
a
word
of
sympathy
You
I
feel
are
one
of
my
oldest
and
truest
friends
at
these
doleful
words
my
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
to
whom
should
I
appeal
but
you
I
wriggled
but
saw
no
way
of
escape
Then
I
burst
forth
In
God
s
name
Ma
dame
what
can
I
say
what
can
I
do
for
you
This
is
the
third
time
I
ve
seen
you
in
my
life
I
only
knew
that
venerable
scamp
Mario
superficially
Your
mother
great
heavens
your
mother
I
ve
seen
often
enough
too
often
She
beamed
on
me
and
became
so
excited
that
she
too
got
on
her
feet
supporting
herself
with
a
gold
topped
stick
Ah
she
triumphantly
cried
I
knew
it
I
knew
it
You
are
the
man
I
thought
you
were
You
hated
my
mother
You
despised
her
husband
and
you
will
I
m
sure
help
me
in
my
search
my
search
The
room
began
to
spin
slowly
around
the
grand
piano
seemed
to
tilt
my
way
Possibly
Zelocca
saw
the
hunted
look
in
my
eyes
a
man
and
a
critic
at
bay
for
she
ex
ploded
the
question
You
will
look
for
him
find
him
bring
him
to
me
I
wavered
in
my
walk
towards
the
door
fearing
heat
apoplexy
yet
I
contrived
to
stammer
Find
find
whom
shall
I
find
for
you
My
real
father
she
fairly
chanted
and
her
face
was
as
the
shining
face
of
an
ardent
neophyte
at
a
tremendously
mystical
ceremony
As
I
left
the
room
on
a
dead
run
I
swear
that
an
aureole
was
foaming
about
her
lovely
head
I
didn
t
stop
sprinting
till
I
reached
the
ground
floor
ran
across
Fifty-ninth
Street
into
the
park
and
finally
at
the
Casino
I
threw
myself
into
a
seat
and
called
for
oh
it
wasn
t
water
after
such
a
display
of
drab
family
linen
one
doesn
t
drink
water
Any
experienced
social
washerwoman
will
tell
you
that
By
Jove
I
was
posi
tively
nervous
with
their
crazy-quilt
relationships
I
pondered
the
situation
Was
Zelocca
an
artistic
liar
a
wonderful
actress
or
simply
a
warm-hearted
woman
too
enthusiastic
in
search
of
a
father
I
couldn
t
make
up
my
mind
I
haven
t
yet
She
may
have
suspected
that
my
critical
notice
of
her
forthcoming
second
concert
might
not
be
so
fervid
as
the
first
because
of
Mario
s
tale
regarding
her
cruelty
I
ve
known
singers
to
tell
worse
lies
for
a
smaller
reason
But
then
she
had
won
her
press
and
public
her
next
appearance
was
bound
to
be
a
repetition
of
the
premiere
as
far
as
success
went
No
I
give
it
up
I
knew
I
should
go
to
all
her
concerts
and
write
sweet
words
about
her
distinguished
art
And
I
did
Later
she
married
her
manager
and
ever
after
wards
lived
unhappily
I
m
beginning
to
regret
I
left
her
so
hurriedly
that
afternoon
Perhaps
she
might
have
given
me
a
clue
What
a
liar
she
was
Or
a
crazy
woman
Her
father
I
believe
was
M
Mario
the
hus
band
of
Madame
and
her
aunt
Oh
hang
her
Rus
sian
aunt
NEWSPAPER
EXPERIENCES
The
daily
newspapers
I
worked
for
while
in
New
York
City
were
not
many
In
1891
The
Recorder
was
started
with
heavy
financial
backing
and
it
ran
a
half-dozen
years
losing
much
money
for
its
sponsors
In
a
way
it
was
a
pioneer
journal
late-comer
as
it
was
Novelties
were
to
be
found
in
its
columns
which
nowadays
are
part
of
the
equipment
of
every
newspaper
A
woman
s
page
a
children
s
page
a
daily
column
devoted
to
theatre
and
music
and
art
criticism
of
a
human
sort
the
ChoIIy
Knickerbocker
column
in
which
fashionable
folk
were
written
about
John
W
Keller
wrote
it
and
last
but
not
least
old
Joe
Howard
s
column
of
gossip
and
com
ment
ranging
in
subject
from
a
dog-fight
to
the
person
ality
of
the
President
These
three
columns
were
to
be
found
on
the
editorial
page
General
Howard
Carroll
was
editor-in-chief
John
W
Keller
managing
editor
My
first
Sunday
editor
was
Julius
Chambers
formerly
of
The
Herald
and
now
with
The
Brooklyn
Eagle
my
second
was
Winfield
Scott
Moody
later
the
editor
of
The
Lamp
a
literary
monthly
published
by
Charles
Scribner
s
Sons
Mr
Moody
who
is
now
in
the
editorial
department
of
The
Evening
Sun
is
the
husband
of
that
pioneer
in
women
s
journalism
Helen
Watterson
Moody
author
of
The
Unquiet
Sex
gorgeous
title
At
the
suggestion
of
W
J
Henderson
John
W
Keller
engaged
me
as
music
critic
on
the
newly
founded
journal
Then
I
became
NEWSPAPER
EXPERIENCES
chums
with
Harry
Neagle
dramatic
editor
who
planned
and
conducted
the
daily
column
to
which
I
contributed
Neagle
roved
about
the
theatre
district
and
captured
the
good
stories
I
did
much
of
the
writing
The
depart
ment
was
called
The
Prompter
It
was
not
the
first
of
its
kind
for
Alan
Dale
wrote
a
daily
column
in
The
Evening
World
but
The
Prompter
was
full
of
life
and
made
readers
Those
were
the
flush
times
of
theatrical
weeklies
Editors
punched
each
other
wrote
terrific
in
sults
and
started
libel
suits
which
usually
ended
before
the
bar
but
not
of
justice
Charles
Alfred
Byrne
after
an
exciting
career
as
editor
of
The
Dramatic
News
and
Truth
was
dramatic
critic
of
The
Morning
Journal
then
edited
and
ably
by
Joseph
I
C
Clarke
Irish
poet
and
patriot
Byrne
had
a
positive
genius
for
getting
in
and
out
of
scrapes
with
men
and
women
He
was
a
pictur
esque
Irishman
who
had
been
educated
in
Belgium
and
his
knowledge
of
the
French
language
and
dramatic
lit
erature
enabled
him
to
import
some
ideas
for
his
pro
ductions
Dion
Boucicault
turned
the
same
trick
more
profitably
indeed
some
of
that
remarkable
man
s
adap
tations
were
as
good
if
not
better
than
the
originals
Byrne
was
a
born
fighter
The
up-town
Recorder
dra
matic
office
was
next
to
Daly
s
Theatre
and
Byrne
and
Neagle
had
desks
in
the
same
room
Thither
I
repaired
every
afternoon
from
The
Musical
Courier
then
at
No
One
day
Byrne
and
Joe
Arthur
the
playwright
quar
relled
and
agreed
to
fight
to
the
finish
but
I
m
not
certain
as
to
the
battle-field
as
I
wasn
t
present
I
think
that
Harry
Neagle
was
bottleholder
Byrne
re
turned
to
the
office
in
a
bad
condition
both
eyes
black
and
blinking
but
his
Celtic
spirit
was
undaunted
You
QO
STEEPLEJACK
ought
to
see
poor
Joe
he
cried
to
me
Arthur
looked
all
right
when
I
saw
him
the
next
day
he
made
the
usual
formal
call
of
condolence
There
was
no
bad
blood
between
the
men
though
Byrne
had
been
badly
whipped
in
the
encounter
Leander
Richardson
was
another
mili
tant
editor
He
is
said
to
have
knocked
out
the
irre
sistible
John
L
Sullivan
in
a
bar-room
brawl
though
Sullivan
must
have
been
under
the
alcoholic
weather
Richardson
was
a
powerful
man
a
bruiser
and
would
have
proved
a
formidable
opponent
at
any
time
He
edited
The
Dramatic
News
and
his
editorial
notes
were

all
this
to

you
that
in

con
ditions
were
worse
than

Vance
Thompson
was
dramatic
and
literary
critic
on
The
Commercial
Advertiser
and
he
introduced
me
to
Foster
Coates
the
editor
As
The
Recorder
had
gone

way
of
all
mishandled
enterprises
I
was
glad
to
be

JAMES
GIBBONS
HUNEKER
1890
with
my
stipendium
from
The
Musical
Courier
enabled
me
to
live
luxuriously
and
work
like
a
dog
Many
were
the
sentimental
abysses
into
which
I
peered
many
the
angry
tearful
partings
why
angry
why
tearful
I
can
t
say
now
Why
young
people
take
such
things
seriously
I
wonder
I
also
wondered
why
The
Morning
Advertiser
which
was
in
a
palpably
decrepit
condition
paid
me
such
a
high
salary
To
be
sure
I
was
working
double-tides
driving
two
or
three
horses
abreast
as
Daniel
Frohman
said
to
me
I
was
both
dramatic
and
musical
critic
and
still
found
time
to
write
for
Town
Topics
Vanity
Fair
and
The
Courier
No
bed-spring-chicken
I
but
a
hustler
I
had
to
be
There
were
other
mouths
to
feed
and
to
use
the
expression
of
Vance
Thompson
the
mortgages
were
so
tame
that
they
fed
from
my
hand
And
a
tame
mortgage
is
more
dangerous
than
a
wild
it
gets
too
familiar
by
half
And
then
a
man
must
pay
alimony
to
his
divorced
ideals
Ain
t
it
fatuous
as
the
old
lady
said
when
she
first
saw
a
hippopotamus
I
was
fatuous
in
my
belief
that
I
could
succeed
where
others
fail
just
as
later
it
took
the
writing
of
fifteen
books
not
only
to
get
my
hand
in
Balzac
s
phrase
but
also
to
get
my
hand
out
One
day
the
office
phoned
me
good
old
Major
Clowes
it
was
who
told
me
that
I
needn
t
come
down-town
there
was
no
longer
a
Morning
Advertiser
Mr
Hearst
had
bought
it
for
the
Associated
Press
fran
chise
and
paid
so
it
was
said
600,000
for
the
privilege
That
accounted
for
the
altitude
of
my
salary
Behold
me
with
only
two
or
three
positions
to
fill
I
filled
them
yet
longed
for
new
worlds
to
conquer
On
The
Recorder
the
work
had
been
severe
on
The
Advertiser
much
lighter
I
didn
t
care
Scribbling
came
easy
and
as
I
had
no
sol
emn
message
to
deliver
to
an
expectant
world
I
sunned
myself
on
the
right
side
of
the
street
and
took
little
heed
of
the
future
George
Washington
Turner
the
manager
of
The
Re
corder
was
a
versatile
man
His
energy
drove
the
ma
chine
of
his
frail
little
body
at
too
high
a
pressure
Chockful
of
ideas
he
made
the
wheels
of
his
newspaper
hum
for
a
while
I
shall
not
forget
the
afternoon
when
in
company
with
Edward
A
MacDowell
the
composer
and
brilliant
pianist
I
went
to
the
Everett
House
on
Union
Square
a
delightful
hostelry
kept
by
old
Mr
Bates
and
where
it
stood
is
now
an
ugly
fortress
of
brick
G
W
Turner
showed
us
a
complicated
invention
of
his
all
spools
and
ribbons
and
wires
a
rudimentary
forerun
ner
of
the
self-playing
piano
one
of
those
diabolic
un
musical
machines
that
lend
a
new
terror
to
life
Why
didn
t
Turner
gain
millions
from
his
idea
and
it
was
one
of
many
A
Yankee
genius
his
but
he
succeeded
in
nothing
but
failures
to
make
an
Irish
bull
While
on
The
Recorder
staff
I
was
asked
by
Editor
Keller
if
I
should
like
to
interview
Annie
Besant
the
osophist
radical
agitator
and
at
one
time
associate
of
Charles
Bradlaugh
She
had
arrived
from
London
that
morning
and
was
at
the
house
of
friends
Fortunately
her
friends
were
my
friends
Mr
and
Mrs
August
Nere
sheimer
cultivated
and
musical
folk
with
whom
I
be
came
acquainted
through
Max
Heinrich
Mr
Nere
sheimer
sang
Schumann
and
Brahms
with
taste
and
in
telligence
and
was
interested
in
the
New
Paths
A
hard
headed
man
of
business
and
a
mystic
The
conjunction
is
not
uncommon
I
had
taken
a
dive
into
that
shining
pool
whose
waters
are
so
deceptively
clear
and
deep
I
knew
Helena
Blavatsky
in
the
flesh
and
I
had
read
some
of
the
effusions
of
Mrs
Besant
I
related
these
facts
to
Mr
Keller
Good
he
cried
and
away
I
went
to
the
faraway
region
of
Lenox
Avenue
there
were
no
subways
and
north
of
I25th
Street
seemed
the
coun
try
When
I
reached
the
Neresheimer
residence
I
found
myself
in
company
with
a
dozen
other
reporters
one
of
whom
quickly
informed
me
that
he
also
represented
The
Recorder
I
was
surprised
So
was
he
when
I
told
him
that
Mr
Keller
had
sent
me
But
there
mustn
t
be
two
stories
he
expostulated
There
won
t
be
I
replied
I
m
not
going
to
pump
Mrs
Besant
as
to
her
political
rows
She
had
experienced
trouble
with
the
British
authorities
over
birth-control
pamphlets
and
Bradlaugh
s
religious
opinions
were
hardly
orthodox
though
now
they
seem
as
innocuous
as
Bob
IngersoII
s
My
friend
pricked
up
his
ears
and
suddenly
became
con
fidential
Say
he
whispered
does
she
read
your
palm
Cross
the
gypsy
s
hand
with
silver
eh
After
that
I
didn
t
bother
with
him
and
presently
Mrs
Nere
sheimer
beckoned
to
me
I
followed
her
and
in
the
morning
room
I
met
a
little
lady
with
a
shy
manner
her
soul
concentrated
in
her
eyes
Such
latent
energy
She
had
just
gone
over
or
was
going
to
Roman
Catholicism
but
of
this
she
said
little
She
had
broken
several
years
before
with
Madame
Blavatsky
but
was
interested
in
what
I
had
to
say
of
that
extraordinary
lady
I
came
away
with
mixed
impressions
of
Mrs
Besant
Like
Helena
Blavatsky
she
was
one
of
those
reservoirs
of
spiritual
forces
that
nature
creates
from
time
to
time
She
was
almost
spirit
a
strange
soul
shone
from
her
eyes
In
her
various
incarnations
in
the
earthly
plane
as
our
theosophical
friends
say
she
had
wavered
from
faith
to
faith
as
wavers
a
candle
in
the
wind
That
she
would
not
long
abide
in
any
house
of
the
flesh
was
written
on
her
candid
brow
She
soon
seceded
from
Mother
Church
as
she
had
earlier
fled
from
the
raw
agnosticism
of
Charles
Bradlaugh
She
is
now
I
hear
a
petticoated
Grand
Panjandrum
in
India
irradiating
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
She
never
possessed
the
profound
animal
magnetism
of
Blavatsky
it
is
the
only
phrase
that
de
scribes
her
nor
her
intellect
nor
yet
the
firm
grasp
on
affairs
displayed
by
the
Purple
Mother
shrewd
Kath
erine
Tingley
of
Point
Loma
California
There
I
think
the
Neresheimers
are
having
renounced
the
world
and
all
its
pomps
to
follow
the
Inner
Light
When
I
had
finished
the
interview
so
graciously
accorded
me
by
Annie
Besant
I
found
a
grumbling
gang
my
associates
impatient
and
blaming
me
for
blocking
their
plan
it
was
to
be
a
joint
interview
cried
the
chap
from
The
Recorder
with
a
taste
for
palmistry
I
didn
t
ex
plain
Why
should
I
have
done
so
If
not
an
Adept
was
I
not
a
Neophyte
Shoo
I
said
and
to
the
office
I
went
and
wrote
an
article
on
Theosophy
and
the
claims
of
the
Ideal
I
capitalised
every
other
word
and
ended
with
a
glowing
description
of
soulful
eyes
It
was
duly
printed
But
my
more
practical
colleague
had
suc
ceeded
in
coaxing
the
lady
into
definite
statements
and
Mr
Keller
liked
his
interview
better
than
mine
When
I
explained
that
Mrs
Besant
had
told
me
many
things
in
confidence
the
mighty
John
he
was
a
giant
roared
Then
why
the
blankety
blank
didn
t
you
print
them
It
s
the
strictly
confidential
confessions
that
the
public
likes
It
was
a
lesson
in
the
art
of
interviewing
that
I
never
forgot
Nowadays
I
print
everything
The
public
as
the
late
Mr
Barnum
insinuated
is
fond
of
mystification
Phineas
knew
I
never
read
modern
mystics
without
some
such
feeling
Just
as
the
mob
always
demands
miracles
so
a
certain
class
of
readers
must
be
fed
with
oracular
phrases
else
perish
from
spiritual
inanition
I
had
read
not
without
considera
ble
misgivings
Isis
Unveiled
what
a
title
to
whet
the
appetite
of
the
curious
and
the
Key
to
Theosophy
by
Helena
Blavatsky
indeed
these
books
are
still
in
my
library
ranged
next
to
the
Koran
and
the
Revela
tions
of
the
Mormon
Apostle
Joseph
Smith
Yet
com
pared
with
Science
and
Health
I
prefer
the
dark
sayings
of
the
Russian
woman
She
at
least
had
a
great
litera
ture
to
tap
Eastern
philosophy
and
she
tapped
it
to
good
purpose
When
I
went
to
New
York
the
Theosoph
ical
movement
was
in
full
blast
Like
the
dilettante
philosophy
of
the
subtle
Bergson
in
our
day
the
doc
trines
of
Blavatsky
and
her
disciples
were
a
fashionable
diversion
Madame
Blavatsky
held
seances
in
which
participated
society
people
and
literati
the
mild
and
hairy
authors
of
that
epoch
James
L
Ford
called
them
the
Century
School
and
avowed
mystics
William
Q
Judge
Col
Olcott
the
Munroes
and
other
lumi
naries
were
much
mentioned
in
the
newspapers
and
we
spoke
of
Karma
as
if
it
were
a
breakfast
food
I
knew
Edwin
Bjeeregaard
Swedish
mystic
and
librarian
at
the
Astor
Library
then
on
Lafayette
Place
now
Lafayette
Street
and
he
introduced
me
to
the
writings
of
the
Theos
ophists
I
swallowed
them
all
but
I
confess
I
found
little
new
or
stimulating
in
them
My
reading
in
the
Eastern
wisdom
had
been
extensive
and
these
restatements
and
attenuations
modulations
and
modern
transpositions
cleverly
as
they
were
fashioned
did
not
impress
me
as
the
Real
Thing
Why
not
take
the
Zend-Avesta
or
the
Triple
Baskets
unadulterated
by
Russian
mysticism
The
trail
of
Helena
Blavatsky
was
over
the
crystal-pure
precepts
of
the
ancients
But
the
woman
herself
That
was
another
thing
I
visited
her
one
rainy
afternoon
at
a
house
not
far
from
As
tor
Place
Never
mind
how
I
secured
my
invitation
except
to
say
that
it
was
not
easy
to
get
one
She
was
only
for
the
elect
I
have
met
many
outlandish
eccentric
and
many
interesting
people
anarchs
of
art
society
literature
but
Blavatsky
left
the
profoundest
image
of
all
in
my
memory
I
say
profound
advisedly
Dostoievsky
or
Joseph
Conrad
would
have
fathomed
her
and
painted
a
deathless
por
trait
of
her
in
prose
but
at
twenty-five
I
was
gullible
and
my
brain
whirled
with
her
cryptic
and
sonorous
phrases
more
sound
than
sense
I
suspect
and
I
was
but
another
bird
lured
by
the
pipe
of
this
fowler
She
was
a
short
fat
woman
with
sensual
lips
without
per
sonal
distinction
and
as
she
wore
a
turban
I
couldn
t
make
out
plainly
her
head
Her
eyes
The
eyes
The
eyes
cried
Bill
Sykes
If
Bill
had
ever
seen
the
eyes
of
Helena
Blavatsky
he
would
have
abandoned
burglary
and
gone
into
retreat
at
Simla
India
there
to
await
his
next
Karma
I
think
now
of
what
Joseph
Conrad
did
with
the
Princess
in
Under
Western
Eyes
From
Bla
vatsky
he
would
have
carved
another
masterpiece
I
have
never
but
once
seen
such
a
pair
of
orbs
in
a
human
s
head
and
those
belong
to
Margaret
Mat
zenauer
the
opera-singer
The
eyes
of
Blavatsky
were
not
so
radiantly
electric
as
Matzenauer
s
but
they
had
the
same
hypnotic
effect
They
were
slightly
glazed
as
if
drugged
by
dreams
of
smoky
enchantments
They
englobed
you
in
their
slow
wide
gaze
I
felt
like.a
rab
bit
in
the
jaws
of
a
boa-constrictor
I
literally
was
Fascinated
I
watched
the
oracle
on
her
tripod
blow
circles
of
cigarette
smoke
through
her
flattened
Kalmuck
nos
trils
The
room
was
dim
There
were
divans
Too
many
Exotic
odours
pervaded
the
lifeless
air
Queen
Helena
she
who
must
be
obeyed
murmured
wisdom
which
I
gulped
without
a
word
An
idol
enthroned
She
was
amiable
She
asked
me
if
I
wrote
and
if
I
were
a
believer
I
swear
that
I
could
have
believed
anything
then
only
to
escape
the
aura
of
intolerable
suspense
in
the
atmosphere
What
was
it
The
celebrated
mes
merism
must
have
been
at
work
else
how
account
for
my
rapidly
oozing
vital
force
I
once
attended
a
Black
Mass
in
Paris
a
blasphemous
travesty
stupid
obscene
yet
I
did
not
feel
as
enervated
as
when
I
kissed
the
pudgy
and
not
too
white
hand
of
Blavatsky
and
got
into
the
open
under
God
s
blue
roof
Pouf
I
inhaled
huge
breezes
and
tried
to
forget
the
Isis
I
had
seen
Unveiled
If
I
remember
my
Oriental
studies
the
wisdom
of
the
East
is
not
tainted
with
sex
sexuality
the
keystone
of
our
world
is
purified
It
becomes
Idea
But
Oriental
wisdom
when
passed
through
the
sieve
of
the
Occident
takes
on
a
more
earthly
aspect
it
is
even
fleshy
I
had
expected
astral
messages
showers
of
roses
from
the
ceiling
the
mango
and
rope-ladder
miracles
perhaps
levitations
But
nothing
happened
except
that
Helena
Blavatsky
gazed
at
me
with
her
sombre
fanatical
gaze
and
my
foot
slipped
at
the
edge
of
her
optical
pool
and
I
fell
into
the
crystal-clear
lake
of
wisdom
which
was
Nirvana
and
I
lived
a
trillion
aeons
until
the
Greek
Kalends
and
the
great
bell
of
destiny
sounding
through
the
Corridor
of
Time
I
awoke
on
Astor
Place
rubbing
my
eyes
and
wondering
whether
it
hadn
t
been
a
night
mare
Maya
The
Mother
of
Illusion
But
her
eyes
the
eyes
of
this
prophetess
of
esoteric
tidings
What
of
her
eyes
They
weren
t
dreamed
Whenever
I
smell
a
Russian
cigarette
I
recall
her
eyes
She
smoked
day
and
night
and
I
can
t
remember
a
word
she
said
to
me
I
should
make
a
grand
theosophist
shouldn
t
I
MONTSALVAT
A
few
years
later
another
strange
adventure
befell
me
It
s
a
queer
yarn
but
it
s
true
As
it
is
in
the
same
key
of
the
pseudo-mystic
I
ll
tell
it
now
We
were
sitting
my
friend
and
I
in
the
smoking-room
of
the
old
Vienna
Cafe
The
long
apartment
was
almost
deserted
it
was
too
late
for
luncheon
too
early
for
tea
In
a
corner
were
Anton
SeidI
and
Dr
Antonin
Dvorak
their
heads
bent
over
a
manuscript
score
the
Slavic
conductor
was
show
ing
the
Hungarian
conductor
the
music
of
his
New
World
Symphony
Happy
folk
thought
I
They
have
an
interest
in
life
while
here
is
Oswald
one
of
the
greatest
violinists
an
unhappy
sulking
wretch
and
for
no
pos
sible
reason
that
I
could
discover
When
he
had
reached
the
age
of
seven
his
passion
for
the
violin
was
so
strong
that
he
was
allowed
to
have
his
way
and
the
schooling
the
lad
received
was
mostly
on
four
strings
Five
years
later
he
attracted
the
attention
of
some
wealthy
amateurs
and
was
sent
abroad
Another
five
years
and
Oswald
had
become
the
favourite
pupil
of
Joachim
and
was
hailed
as
the
successor
to
Wieniawski
Never
had
there
been
such
brilliant
daring
talent
seldom
such
an
interest
ing
personality
In
his
play
there
was
the
tenderness
of
woman
and
the
fire
of
hell
His
technique
was
supreme
and
when
he
returned
to
New
York
his
audiences
went
mad
over
him
I
say
mad
because
I
saw
the
madness
It
was
Paderewskian
It
was
Jascha
Heifetzian
I
was
an
old
friend
and
his
handsome
face
glowed
when
I
ioo
STEEPLEJACK
called
at
his
hotel
in
my
capacity
of
music
reporter
Oswald
was
a
man
who
never
drank
His
one
dissipa
tion
was
coffee
He
smoked
cigarettes
but
not
furiously
The
women
who
sought
him
were
treated
with
distin
guished
courtesy
but
he
contrived
to
evade
entangle
ments
I
don
t
think
he
was
ever
in
love
Then
came
the
change
At
first
I
noticed
it
in
his
playing
At
the
last
Boston
Symphony
Concert
in
Steinway
Hall
he
had
interpreted
the
Brahms
Concerto
in
a
listless
tepid
man
ner
and
his
phrasing
was
not
faultless
It
was
the
ab
sence
of
the
inner
spirit
the
fire
that
set
buzzing
critics
and
public
What
ailed
the
man
Was
he
worn
out
by
the
labours
of
a
strenuous
musical
season
I
sus
pected
a
reason
more
dangerous
After
months
of
de
spondencies
and
disappearances
I
had
caught
him
at
the
Vienna
Cafe
and
put
the
question
to
him
He
impatiently
pushed
aside
his
coffee
Of
course
if
you
will
insist
on
preaching
I
must
leave
you
It
s
a
new
role
for
you
Oswald
you
needn
t
take
me
up
that
way
I
m
not
preaching
I
m
playing
the
part
of
a
friend
in
a
case
of
this
kind
and
The
only
kind
you
can
play
he
interrupted
That
s
right
my
boy
Flaunt
your
virtuosity
under
my
nose
I
m
not
a
bull
when
I
see
red
Go
on
he
answered
in
a
resigned
manner
reconsidering
his
rejected
coffee
What
s
the
matter
with
you
Oswald
Come
be
frank
with
me
You
haven
t
touched
your
fiddle
for
months
You
don
t
show
yourself
to
your
friends
Are
you
in
debt
are
you
in
trouble
are
you
in
love
Stop
a
moment
gt
for
he
had
begun
to
scowl
I
don
t
wish
to
pry
into
your
pri
vate
affairs
but
you
owe
your
most
intimate
friend
some
sort
of
explanation
as
to
your
odd
behaviour
besides
old
man
you
are
looking
very
bad
Your
skin
is
like
the
Yellow
Book
and
your
expression
suggests
Aubrey
Beardsley
s
most
morbid
manner
I
stopped
for
want
of
breath
Oswald
smiled
rather
contemptuously
at
my
stale
similes
but
held
his
peace
and
drank
his
coffee
ordered
a
fresh
one
and
over
the
third
cup
he
brightened
and
slowly
rolled
a
cigarette
I
watched
him
His
face
looked
worn
and
wan
his
colour
was
leaden
and
his
eyes
lacked
intensity
His
handsome
nose
purely
Greek
in
line
was
pinched
his
mop
of
curls
disordered
Evi
dently
he
had
been
having
a
hard
time
but
his
was
no
common
form
of
dissipation
At
last
rousing
himself
he
gazed
at
me
almost
piteously
It
was
the
silent
cry
of
a
man
going
under
the
cry
of
a
man
whom
none
could
save
Involuntarily
I
caught
at
his
arm
so
unpremedi
tated
was
it
and
he
so
easily
read
the
meaning
of
the
gesture
that
he
turned
away
his
head
For
some
minutes
the
silence
lay
thickly
upon
us
then
I
spoke
to
the
stricken
man
Your
face
recalls
to
me
one
of
those
damned
souls
that
Dante
the
dreamer
of
accurst
visions
met
midway
in
his
mortal
life
And
I
am
a
damned
irrevocably
lost
soul
and
because
of
my
own
perverse
temperament
Why
does
music
lead
us
into
such
black
alleys
My
God
Why
He
was
keyed
up
to
a
dangerous
pitch
I
forebore
further
questioning
We
aimlessly
drifted
out
of
the
cafe
and
I
going
towards
theatre-land
we
separated
for
the
night
Naturally
I
thought
much
about
Oswald
Evil
he
was
not
There
was
no
love-affair
The
idea
of
hypnotic
obsession
suggested
itself
but
was
at
once
dismissed
The
curious
part
of
the
affair
was
his
refusal
to
play
either
in
private
or
in
public
He
never
went
to
concerts
and
had
an
absolute
horror
of
music
Long
absences
from
his
house
alarmed
me
I
made
up
my
mind
that
some
one
was
leading
him
astray
I
determined
to
find
out
Several
months
after
our
meeting
at
the
cafe
I
met
him
again
He
was
gaunt
yellow
almost
shabby
Another
solution
of
the
problem
presented
itself
perhaps
like
other
ardent
temperaments
he
had
tasted
of
that
deadly
drug
admired
of
the
Chinese
A
drug
eater
I
taxed
him
with
it
As
we
slowly
walked
down-town
we
had
stopped
under
an
electric
light
it
was
a
dismal
Novem
ber
night
a
night
of
mists
and
shadows
Oswald
spoke
faintly
You
accuse
me
of
the
opium
habit
If
I
were
a
victim
I
would
be
a
thrice-blessed
man
Alas
It
is
much
worse
Completely
mystified
I
took
the
arm
of
the
unfortunate
violinist
in
mine
for
he
seemed
feeble
and
asked
him
if
he
had
eaten
that
day
He
nodded
I
did
not
believe
him
We
left
Union
Square
behind
us
and
soon
reached
Astor
Place
I
clung
to
him
and
only
when
we
turned
down
the
long
dark
street
where
the
library
then
stood
did
I
notice
our
whereabouts
My
companion
moved
with
the
air
of
a
man
to
whom
things
corporeal
no
longer
had
meaning
When
we
arrived
at
the
lower
end
of
the
ill-lighted
avenue
I
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
were
drifting
into
strange
quarters
He
gave
me
a
sharp
glance
seized
my
elbow
and
guided
me
up
the
steps
of
a
low
building
in
semi-obscurity
He
did
not
ring
but
rapped
with
something
metallic
at
once
the
door
was
opened
and
I
saw
a
hallway
filled
with
the
violent
rays
of
a
lamp
I
experienced
a
repugnance
to
the
place
I
would
have
gone
away
but
Oswald
barred
the
passage
regarding
me
with
such
sad
eyes
that
I
seemed
to
be
dealing
with
a
deranged
man
Welcome
he
said
welcome
to
Montsalvat
Then
I
noticed
over
the
door
an
incomprehensible
musical
motto
which
I
did
not
at
first
recognise
But
I
followed
my
friend
into
a
com
fortable
library
warmed
by
a
fireplace
in
which
hissed
and
crumbled
huge
lumps
of
cannel
coal
In
all
faith
I
had
to
confess
that
the
apartment
was
homelike
though
the
tragic
expression
of
Oswald
recalled
to
me
that
I
might
discover
his
tormenting
secret
And
what
said
I
sitting
down
and
lighting
a
cigar
is
Montsalvat
And
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
s
fantastic
means
the
fearsome
motto
over
the
door
Is
this
a
suicide
club
or
is
it
some
new-fangled
aesthetic
organisation
where
intense
young
men
say
sweet
things
about
art
Or
is
it
a
singing
society
or
and
here
the
humour
of
the
situa
tion
broke
in
on
me
mayhap
it
is
a
secret
college
of
organists
wherein
pedal
practice
may
be
continued
dur
ing
late
hours
without
arousing
refractory
neighbours
Oswald
with
his
glance
of
anxious
rectitude
did
not
smile
at
my
foolish
speech
Montsalvat
is
not
any
of
those
things
he
softly
replied
True
it
is
a
club
which
oc
casionally
meets
but
not
for
recreation
or
discussion
You
have
read
the
poet
Baudelaire
have
you
not
dear
friend
Then
you
may
remember
those
profound
lines
beginning
J
ai
vu
parfois
au
fond
d
un
theatre
banal
une
fee
allumer
dans
un
ciel
infernal
It
sounds
like
Poe
done
into
French
said
I
wondering
at
Oswald
s
suppressed
excitement
like
a
more
malign
Poe
John
Martin
the
English
mezzotinter
could
have
translated
this
poem
of
sombre
bronze
into
his
art
of
black
and
white
you
yourself
Oswald
remind
me
of
that
artist
s
vis
ion
Sadak
Seeking
the
Waters
of
Oblivion
I
felt
I
was
talking
for
effect
His
actions
puzzled
me
Why
in
this
lonely
house
should
he
become
emotional
over
a
verse
of
Baudelaire
Why
should
the
Redemption
theme
from
Parsifal
be
placed
across
the
door-top
I
had
io
4
STEEPLEJACK
recognised
the
music
Suddenly
voices
aroused
him
and
he
started
up
crying
They
are
here
Folding
doors
heavily
draped
by
black
velvet
were
pushed
asunder
and
I
found
myself
staring
about
me
in
a
large
chamber
with
a
low
ceiling
There
were
no
pic
tures
two
busts
were
in
a
recess
and
seemed
to
regard
with
malevolent
expression
the
assemblage
I
noticed
that
they
were
plaster
heads
of
Arthur
Schopenhauer
and
Richard
Wagner
Conversation
was
languidly
progress
ing
We
sat
Oswald
and
I
in
a
corner
No
one
paid
attention
to
us
I
studied
the
people
about
me
They
were
the
faces
of
cultured
men
a
few
dissipated
but
the
majority
were
those
of
dreamers
men
for
whom
the
world
had
proved
too
strong
men
who
were
striving
to
forget
I
saw
several
musicians
one
poet
a
half-dozen
painters
No
evidence
of
opium
was
to
be
seen
no
one
drank
all
smoked
As
we
entered
Chopin
s
name
had
been
mentioned
and
a
big
lazy
blond
fellow
said
Oh
Chopin
We
are
I
hope
beyond
Chopin
or
Poe
Debussy
is
our
music-maker
now
as
Browning
did
not
say
Why
asked
a
pianist
Why
have
we
got
beyond
Chopin
For
me
the
Pole
has
an
invincible
charm
That
s
because
you
are
a
pianist
came
the
retort
You
know
I
never
play
any
more
was
the
sulky
rejoinder
For
a
time
the
conversation
halted
What
does
it
all
mean
I
whispered
Oswald
shook
his
head
Montsalvat
my
friends
said
a
grave
measured
voice
is
the
ultimate
refuge
for
souls
resolved
to
abjure
the
illusion
of
happiness
Our
illustrious
masters
and
inspirers
Schopenhauer
and
Wagner
declared
that
only
the
saint
and
the
artist
may
attain
to
Nirvana
in
this
life
But
we
hold
that
the
artist
is
ever
the
victim
of
the
Life-Lie
of
the
World-Illusion
Wagner
when
he
wrote
Parsifal
revealed
his
hatred
of
art
of
the
very
root
of
life
Full
well
he
knew
the
evils
brought
into
this
world
by
music
by
sex
Immobility
the
supreme
ab
negation
of
the
will
the
absolute
suppression
of
the
pas
sions
better
the
state
of
non-existence
are
they
not
worthy
of
attainment
To
live
in
the
Idea
Ah
my
friends
I
fear
that
we
are
still
too
worldly
that
we
will
stamp
with
too
much
vehemence
on
our
inner
nature
renounce
thou
shalt
shalt
renounce
Surely
by
this
time
we
should
have
attained
psychic
freedom
Oh
for
a
cenobite
s
life
Oh
for
a
crust
and
a
hut
in
some
vast
wilderness
The
blood
burns
hotly
in
cities
life
thrusts
its
multi-coloured
grin
upon
you
there
you
can
not
es
cape
it
To
live
on
one
tone
yourself
to
be
the
pedal
point
over
which
life
s
jangling
harmonies
pass
your
soul-suspension
to
do
this
is
to
live
not
play
music
to
do
as
did
the
Knights
of
Montsalvat
that
is
existence
Wagner
knew
it
when
he
created
his
Parsifal
for
all
Time
a
perfect
mirror
of
the
souls
of
pure
men
who
re
volted
at
the
banality
of
quotidian
life
A
new
mo
nastic
ideal
is
our
Modern
Montsalvat
In
wonder
I
gazed
at
the
speaker
not
a
hoary-headed
Pundit
but
a
youth
of
perhaps
twenty-five
summers
His
strained
expression
his
sunken
cheeks
lent
him
a
detached
even
fantastic
appearance
In
what
manner
of
company
was
I
What
the
aims
of
this
strange
crew
Men
in
the
heat
and
prime
of
their
youth
discoursing
Schopen
hauer
Wagner
Chopin
Verlaine
as
if
the
last
keen
joy
were
a
denial
of
self
almost
depraved
I
was
bewildered
The
voice
of
Oswald
broke
in
J
aime
les
nuages
les
merveilleux
nuages
There
you
go
again
with
your
Baudelaire
cried
some
one
Oswald
I
fear
that
you
still
love
life
It
s
consuming
you
You
delight
in
reciting
verses
beginning
J
aime
You
have
no
right
to
love
anything
not
even
dream-tipped
Baudelairian
clouds
I
suspect
that
you
still
yearn
for
your
fiddle
and
read
that
apostle
of
damnable
Titanism
Nietzsche
At
the
name
of
the
arch-heretic
of
brutal
force
of
bar
baric
energy
the
others
shuddered
Oswald
seemed
crushed
The
voice
of
the
new
speaker
was
toneless
and
depressing
I
felt
mentally
nauseated
What
club
of
hopeless
wretches
had
I
encountered
Robert
Louis
Stevenson
when
he
invented
his
Suicide
Club
had
apparently
reached
the
bottom
of
the
vicious
But
here
was
something
more
infernal
a
darker
nuance
of
pain
a
club
of
moral
suicides
living
yet
dead
slaugh
terers
of
their
own
souls
men
who
deliberately
withdrew
from
all
commerce
with
the
world
men
who
abandoned
their
ambitions
successes
friends
families
to
plunge
beyond
hope
of
redemption
into
a
Satanic
apathy
a
slavery
worse
than
drugs
yet
gleaning
a
fearful
and
ex
quisite
joy
in
the
abstention
from
joys
an
intellectual
debasement
a
slow
strangling
of
the
will
coupled
with
the
sadistic
delight
that
comes
in
dallying
on
the
for
bidden
edge
of
pain
and
pleasure
Morose
delectation
is
the
precise
name
given
to
this
lustless
lust
by
wise
Mother
Church
greatest
of
psychologists
Surely
Bud
dhism
in
its
birthplace
can
not
work
such
evil
as
I
saw
before
me
These
men
had
not
the
absorbed
air
of
de
voutness
and
interior
exaltation
I
have
caught
on
the
faces
of
certain
East
Indians
Nor
were
they
lotus
eaters
Eastern
mysticism
grafted
on
Western
faiths
may
result
unfavourably
In
the
weary
faces
around
me
in
the
agonised
eyes
of
Oswald
I
saw
the
hopelessness
of
such
moral
transplanting
Oswald
was
dying
by
infini
tesimal
degrees
dying
withal
His
violin
was
his
life
His
music
was
dammed
up
in
him
The
struggle
against
his
deepest
instincts
was
an
unequal
one
he
must
go
mad
or
perish
And
these
men
enjoyed
the
spectacle
of
his
ruin
To
their
jaded
brains
his
pitiable
condition
was
as
absinthe
They
were
Manicheans
They
wor
shipped
Satan
saying
Evil
be
thou
my
Good
Oswald
with
his
youth
his
genius
his
once
brilliant
career
had
been
drawn
into
this
maelstrom
of
Nothingness
His
life
I
thought
his
life
has
not
yet
been
lived
he
is
not
ruined
in
body
his
soul
is
not
yet
a
thing
of
dust
and
darkness
like
the
others
What
a
sacrifice
is
his
I
My
face
must
have
been
an
index
of
my
agitation
for
the
same
voice
sardonically
continued
Oswald
I
fear
has
a
Philistine
with
him
to-night
Oswald
can
not
break
from
earthly
ties
My
dear
vio
linist
you
had
better
return
to
your
Bohemia
with
its
laughter
its
wine
its
silly
women
and
to
your
fiddle
with
its
four
mewing
strings
Such
toys
are
for
boys
the
illusion
of
love
women
s
soft
bodies
and
other
gross
nudities
Return
Oswald
with
your
friend
to
your
old
life
Make
empty
useless
noises
call
them
art
and
forget
the
lofty
heights
of
serene
speculation
the
pure
ravishing
vision
of
a
will
subdued
Go
Oswald
and
do
not
remember
the
Life
Contemplative
or
Montsalvat
and
its
Knights
in
search
of
the
Holy
Grail
of
Renuncia
tion
Instead
go
join
the
modulating
crowd
The
voice
grew
more
silvery
but
it
pleaded
as
it
menaced
In
the
hazy
atmosphere
I
saw
with
apprehension
the
altered
expression
of
my
poor
friend
His
eyes
closed
accentuating
the
violet
bruises
beneath
them
his
body
became
rigid
A
living
corpse
he
only
obeyed
the
will
io8
STEEPLEJACK
of
the
Master
With
an
effort
he
roused
himself
and
taking
me
by
the
arm
muttered
Come
Silently
we
walked
through
the
library
and
into
the
hall
The
busts
were
more
malevolent
than
before
The
street
door
was
opened
for
us
but
I
alone
went
into
the
mist
and
darkness
The
waters
of
the
river
have
a
saffron
and
a
sickly
hue
and
they
flow
not
onward
to
the
sea
but
palpitate
forever
and
forever
beneath
the
red
eye
of
the
sun
with
a
tumultuous
and
convulsive
motion
For
many
miles
on
either
side
of
the
river
s
oozy
bed
is
a
pale
desert
of
gigantic
water-lilies
They
sigh
one
unto
the
other
in
that
solitude
and
stretch
towards
the
heaven
their
long
and
ghastly
necks
and
nod
to
and
fro
their
everlasting
heads
And
there
is
an
indistinct
murmur
which
cometh
out
from
among
them
like
the
rushing
of
subterrene
water
And
they
sigh
one
unto
the
other
Edgar
Poe
wrote
that
in
his
Silence
Poe
too
had
tarried
in
the
House
of
the
Ineffectual
Oswald
I
never
saw
again
His
case
is
an
image
of
the
sinister
consequences
of
uni
versal
egoism
so
powerfully
expressed
in
the
lines
of
the
French
poet
Alfred
de
Vigny

I
AM
A
FREE-LANCE
It
was
at
the
invitation
of
Paul
Dana
that
I
joined
the
staff
of
the
New
York
Sun
in
1900
There
was
no
music-critic
and
Mr
Chester
S
Lord
had
read
my
Chopin
hence
the
engagement
The
great
race
of
edi
tors
was
a
thing
of
the
past
Charles
A
Dana
the
noblest
Roman
of
them
all
was
dead
about
three
years
when
I
had
the
luck
to
become
an
humble
member
of
the
insti
tution
created
by
him
I
remained
with
The
Sun
fifteen
years
writing
for
it
until
April
1917
when
our
entrance
into
the
war
automatically
stopped
discussion
of
aesthetics
I
was
away
several
years
in
Europe
so
I
can
claim
a
connection
of
fifteen
years
For
the
columns
I
wrote
musical
dramatic
art
and
literary
criticism
I
wrote
editorials
and
for
years
I
was
on
the
much
envied
edi
torial
page
with
articles
principally
on
art
but
often
every
other
subject
under
the
heavens
save
politics
I
fenced
with
William
James
at
the
time
pragmatism
was
spelled
with
a
capital
P
He
did
me
the
honour
of
writing
me
most
interesting
letters
on
the
subject
which
letters
are
now
in
the
possession
of
his
son
Henry
James
and
probably
will
be
published
when
Mr
James
has
the
leisure
to
give
us
his
long-expected
study
on
his
great
father
I
also
attacked
single-handed
that
subtle
sophist
Henri
Bergson
who
was
called
by
me
The
Playboy
of
the
Western
World
But
my
proudest
day
on
The
Sun
was
when
I
had
five
columns
in
one
day
on
its
edi
i
io
STEEPLEJACK
to
rial
page
That
was
a
stunt
If
I
may
recall
them
they
were
devoted
to
a
study
of
Botticelli
seen
with
mod
ern
eyes
a
story
of
the
Emma
Bovary
the
real
name
of
the
unhappy
heroine
and
her
village
being
given
and
the
sources
from
which
Flaubert
drew
his
immortal
portrait
finally
a
column
devoted
to
the
genius
of
Rodin
the
French
sculptor
When
Franklin
Fyles
for
years
dra
matic
editor
became
ill
I
took
his
position
and
not
without
misgivings
But
my
first
assignment
was
the
reappearance
of
Eleanora
Duse
in
the
D
Annunzio
plays
La
Gioconda
Francesca
da
Rimini
and
La
Citta
Morta
and
as
I
had
already
made
a
study
of
her
and
knew
the
plays
in
the
original
I
came
off
creditably
enough
and
then
my
six
years
of
laborious
theatrical
apprenticeship
counted
for
something
But
somebody
always
was
after
my
job
on
The
Sun
And
I
was
too
amiable
I
went
to
Europe
wrote
about
theatres
from
London
to
Budapest
via
Paris
Rome
Vienna
When
William
M
Laffan
bought
the
news
paper
I
relinquished
my
position
as
dramatic
editor
to
John
Corbin
I
began
writing
of
art
and
succeeded
in
pleasing
Mr
Laffan
himself
an
art
critic
an
authority
on
porcelains
and
a
collector
At
his
suggestion
I
went
to
Spain
for
five
months
and
saw
the
Velasquez
pictures
at
the
Prado
Madrid
and
lived
to
write
a
book
about
him
and
other
moderns
Velasquez
is
still
the
most
modern
of
all
painters
A
man
of
force
and
enamelled
with
prejudices
Mr
Laffan
had
his
likes
and
dislikes
usually
violent
After
a
study
of
George
Woodward
Wickersham
had
appeared
on
the
editorial
page
I
think
I
called
it
a
cabinet
picture
because
Mr
Wickersham
had
just
become
Attorney-General
in
President
Taft
s
Cab
inet
Mr
Laffan
sent
for
me
and
I
expected
a
raking
I
AM
A
FREE-LANCE
in
but
it
was
quite
otherwise
While
in
Paris
I
wrote
for
him
a
review
of
an
Independent
Salon
and
a
few
months
later
on
my
return
a
notice
of
the
Comparative
Exhibi
tion
at
the
Academy
of
the
Fine
Arts
These
articles
led
to
my
writing
art
criticism
till
1917
with
the
excep
tion
of
the
years
of
my
absence
Thanks
to
the
editor-in-chief
Edward
Page
Mitchell
I
wrote
signed
and
unsigned
book
reviews
on
the
page
made
famous
by
Hazeltine
Edward
P
Mitchell
is
an
editor
in
a
thousand
To
work
with
him
is
a
privilege
and
a
pleasure
He
always
gets
the
best
from
a
man
Sympathy
is
the
keynote
of
his
character
Chester
S
Lord
for
so
many
years
managing
editor
I
knew
before
I
wrote
for
The
Sun
We
had
foregathered
with
Edward
A
Dithmar
dramatic
critic
of
The
Times
and
Mont
gomery
Schuyler
Lawrence
Reamer
and
other
prime
spirits
in
Perry
s
old
drug
store
Not
without
warrant
was
Mr
Lord
rechristened
the
Easy
Boss
Beloved
by
his
young
men
as
he
called
them
though
some
were
grey
he
also
had
the
disagreeable
task
of
lopping
off
heads
which
task
he
accomplished
in
a
humane
manner
I
lost
my
official
head
once
some
friction
between
the
upper
and
nether
millstones
in
which
I
was
ground
to
powder
and
no
executioner
could
have
been
more
easy
besides
he
knew
I
would
return
I
was
always
returning
to
The
Sun
It
is
a
superstition
Just
to
encourage
struggling
journalistic
talent
I
may
tell
out
of
school
that
I
was
paid
the
highest
salary
in
town
as
a
dramatic
critic
125
a
week
and
I
still
cherish
the
little
pay
envelope
on
which
I
wrote
as
Finis
The
last
of
the
Mohicans
This
was
in
1904
But
I
earned
much
more
when
later
I
wrote
art
criticisms
edi
torials
book
reviews
and
travel-notes
for
Mr
Mitchell
Those
were
the
palmy
days
when
the
handy
all-round
man
had
his
innings
Now
each
department
is
stan
dardised
Newspapers
have
lost
their
personal
flavour
Huge
syndicates
have
taken
the
colour
and
character
and
quality
from
daily
journalism
I
am
quite
sure
that
if
ever
a
comprehensive
history
of
The
Sun
is
written
my
name
will
be
absent
simply
because
I
would
be
consid
ered
a
myth
the
figment
of
a
fantastic
imagination
Much
of
my
Sun
work
appeared
duly
expanded
in
Iconoclasts
Egoists
and
Promenades
I
have
told
you
how
I
interviewed
Pope
Pius
X
and
visited
Calabria
after
the
earthquake
for
the
New
York
Herald
That
was
in
1905
A
year
later
and
for
the
same
newspaper
I
made
little
journeys
to
certain
eastern
watering-places
from
Bar
Harbor
to
Cape
May
not
forgetting
Newport
Long
Branch
and
Atlantic
City
As
I
had
often
visited
Ostend
Brighton
Scheveningen
Blankenberghe
Zandvoort
Trouville
and
a
dozen
other
European
vacation
beaches
I
had
opportunities
to
make
comparisons
I
made
them
wondering
why
despite
the
millions
annually
spent
over
here
we
have
so
little
to
show
for
them
that
is
substantial
Atlantic
City
is
an
honourable
exception
I
have
yet
to
see
its
duplicate
But
the
solid
stone
of
the
Brighton
and
Ostend
and
Scheveningen
sea
promenades
we
have
not
And
our
cuisine
And
the
absurd
prohibition
Europe
is
our
master
in
the
art
of
making
life
pleasant
at
summer
re
sorts
I
wrote
music
criticism
for
Town
Topics
when
such
men
as
C
M
S
McLellan
Percival
Pollard
Charles
Frederic
Nirdlinger
were
making
its
columns
attractive
When
Nathan
Straus
Jr
bought
Puck
with
the
idea
of
transforming
it
from
a
barber-shop
comic
weekly
to
an
artistic
revue
I
conducted
a
page
The
Seven
Arts
but
the
times
were
not
propitious
War
was
the
only
interest
and
the
arts
could
go
hang
They
did
Despite
the
money
spent
on
illustrations
Puck
did
not
fulfil
its
new
mission
and
was
sold
to
Mr
Hearst
in
1917
and
is
now
non-existent
For
the
New
York
Times
I
wrote
much
in
1912
from
European
cities
A
mania
for
travel
set
in
I
lived
in
London
Paris
Berlin
Brussels
Bruges
Vienna
I
ate
spaghetti
in
Milan
drank
dark
beer
in
Munich
I
saw
midnight
suns
and
daughters
of
the
dawn
I
loved
Prague
in
Bohemia
deeming
it
a
fit
companion
for
Toledo
Spain
one
of
the
most
fascinating
cities
on
the
globe
I
loved
Rome
Who
doesn
t
And
found
Venice
too
florid
and
operatic
But
my
beloved
Holland
and
Belgium
came
first
especially
Bruges
The
Low
lands
always
appealed
Rodin
spoke
of
the
slow
landscapes
of
the
Dutch
country
It
is
an
illuminating
phrase
The
grandeur
of
the
Alps
left
me
rather
un
touched
I
quite
appreciate
their
frosty
sublimities
also
feel
their
lack
of
human
interest
The
flatlands
of
Holland
with
their
processional
poplars
their
silvery
shining
network
of
canals
the
groups
of
patient
cattle
egotistic
windmills
and
the
low
friendly
skies
all
these
went
to
my
heart
like
a
rich
warming
cordial
The
home
like
life
the
treasure
houses
of
art
at
Amsterdam
The
Hague
and
Haarlem
win
the
imagination
and
there
is
an
abundance
of
good
music
The
Concertgebouw
in
Amsterdam
listens
to
symphonic
music
and
the
best
of
European
singers
and
players
with
Willem
Mengelberg
as
conductor
and
a
brilliant
one
he
is
I
had
settled
in
but
destiny
had
something
to
say
and
I
found
myself
once
more
in
Manhattan
In
the
quaint
Dutch
town
J
vainly
sought
for
the
peace
of
Utrecht
which
is
purely
historic
as
it
is
for
its
size
as
noisy
as
Naples
Rug
beating
there
is
raised
to
the
dignity
of
a
peace
treaty
I
heard
under
Conductor
Mengelberg
compositions
by
three
Dutchwomen
Cornelia
Van
Oosterzee
Anna
Lasu
brecht
Vos
and
Elizabeth
Kuypers
that
gave
me
plea
sure
Miss
Van
Oosterzee
s
symphony
is
an
impor
tant
work
With
such
a
world-renowned
genius
as
Hugo
De
Vries
at
Amsterdam
and
such
a
profound
neurologist
as
Doctor
C
U
Ariens
Kappers
of
the
Cen
tral
Institute
of
Brain
Research
at
Amsterdam
or
Pro
fessor
Dubois
who
discovered
in
Java
the
missing
link
Pithecanthropus
Erectus
at
Amsterdam
Hol
land
is
not
soon
likely
to
fall
out
of
the
fighting
line
in
science
I
saw
our
remote
and
distinguished
collat
eral
at
the
Amsterdam
Museum
He
has
been
recon
structed
by
Dubois
and
I
confess
I
ve
encountered
far
more
repulsive
specimens
among
his
human
cousins
but
the
Piltdown
skull
dug
up
in
England
in
1912
is
more
in
the
key
of
Homo
Sapiens
Thanks
to
the
courtesy
of
Doctor
Kappers
I
met
Hugo
De
Vries
in
his
own
ex
perimental
garden
at
the
Amsterdam
Botanical
Garden
Hortus
Siccus
is
the
legend
over
the
gates
Professor
De
Vries
he
is
a
professor
at
the
University
of
Amster
dam
looked
very
well
after
his
long
visit
to
the
United
States
where
in
New
York
he
was
invited
by
President
Butler
to
join
the
faculty
of
Columbia
College
He
wisely
declined
the
honour
notwithstanding
the
horti
cultural
temptations
of
Bronx
Park
but
a
canny
Dutch
man
he
hammered
this
offer
into
the
heads
of
the
Dutch
Government
and
was
given
a
new
and
more
commodious
building
in
which
to
work
out
his
famous
doctrine
of
plant
and
flower
mutation
He
admires
Luther
Burbank
and
thus
summed
up
the
difference
in
their
respective
experi
ments
Burbank
crosses
species
I
seek
to
create
new
ones
He
does
create
new
species
does
this
benevolent
looking
Klingsor
with
the
flowers
of
his
magic
garden
But
his
is
white
not
black
magic
He
lets
nature
fol
low
her
capricious
way
giving
her
from
time
to
time
a
hint
A
sort
of
floral
eugenics
I
saw
eight-leaved
clovers
and
was
told
that
many
more
leaves
would
bud
as
originally
the
clover
was
a
stalk
full
of
buds
For
the
superstitiously
inclined
there
are
three
four
five
six
and
seven-leaved
varieties
The
evening
primrose
Eon
thera
lamarckiana
was
then
the
object
of
the
De
Vries
experiments
Certainly
this
yellow
flower
means
more
to
him
than
it
did
to
Wordsworth
s
Peter
The
pro
fessor
ties
up
its
petals
in
tiny
bags
and
thus
protected
from
marauding
birds
and
bees
and
no
doubt
bored
by
solitude
though
pistil
and
stamen
remain
the
flower
begins
to
put
forth
a
new
species
I
witnessed
the
miracle
of
a
half-dozen
flowers
coming
into
the
world
that
were
not
in
existence
the
season
before
It
reminded
me
of
Professor
Jacques
Loeb
and
his
creative
evolu
tion
with
sea-urchins
That
is
creating
life
and
even
Sir
Oliver
Lodge
would
give
his
assent
to
the
statement
But
when
I
spoke
later
in
London
to
Sir
E
Ray
Lankester
a
distin
guished
disciple
of
Huxley
and
a
hardened
Darwinian
he
rather
pooh-poohed
the
De
Vries
experiments
And
now
Professor
Henry
Fairfield
Osborn
president
of
the
American
Museum
of
Natural
History
is
inclined
to
minimise
not
so
much
the
value
of
the
De
Vries
dis
coveries
but
their
philosophical
inferences
He
writes
in
his
magisterial
volume
The
Origin
and
Evolution
of
Life
that
the
essential
feature
of
De
Vries
observa
tions
is
that
discontinuous
saltations
in
directions
that
are
entirely
fortuitous
a
theoretic
principle
which
agreeing
closely
with
Darwin
such
mutations
are
attributable
to
sudden
alterations
of
molecular
and
atomic
constitution
in
the
heredity
chromatin
or
the
altered
forms
of
energy
supplied
to
the
chromatin
during
development
Chromatin
is
another
term
for
the
germ-plasm
of
Weismann
But
according
to
De
Vries
his
discovery
is
the
reverse
of
Darwin
s
theory
that
evo
lution
is
slow
orderly
progressive
and
without
jumps
nature
never
leaps
there
are
no
sudden
miracles
De
Vries
proves
the
opposite
the
miracle
takes
place
over
night
in
his
experiments
nature
strikes
out
blindly
swiftly
apparently
without
selection
The
new
flower
is
a
constant
though
it
struggles
to
revert
to
its
old
pupillaceous
state
I
was
shown
what
he
calls
a
rosette
a
green
plantlike
production
a
new
birth
of
the
com
monplace
primrose
In
Alabama
Professor
De
Vries
gathered
his
parent
flower
He
was
interested
when
I
told
him
that
I
had
seen
Leidy
and
Cope
at
the
Academy
of
Natural
Sciences
Philadelphia
and
he
praised
their
genius
He
tramped
Fairmount
Park
and
knows
the
Bronx
Botanical
Garden
His
American
travels
and
ex
periments
are
published
in
a
big
volume
but
I
balk
at
Dutch
notwithstanding
its
relationships
to
the
German
and
English
languages
His
great
work
on
Mutation
is
translated
The
author
speaks
and
writes
English
flu
ently
and
idiomatically
I
was
loath
to
leave
this
man
who
in
the
Indian
summer
of
his
life
looks
like
a
bard
and
philosopher
summoning
strange
and
beautiful
flowers
from
the
vasty
deep
of
nature
He
is
an
exalted
member
of
the
most
honourable
profession
in
the
world
a
gentle
gardener
of
genius
Hugo
De
Vries
is
one
of
the
few
significant
figures
in
the
history
of
science
since
Darwin
A
brief
connection
with
another
journal
gave
me
much
satisfaction
though
less
cash
than
kudos
It
was
The
Weekly
Critical
Review
devoted
to
literature

I
flattered
As
I
have

Mine
was
the

I
m
not
in

ashamed
to
admit
it
You
if

would
be

felt

exclaimed

was

and
my
study
of
n8
STEEPLEJACK
Maeterlinck
s
play
Joyzelle
brought
me
letters
from
the
poet
and
from
Huysmans
and
De
Gourmont
This
was
in
June
1903
Joris-Karel
Huysmans
his
bap
tismal
names
were
George
Charles
but
as
a
pen-name
he
used
their
Dutch
equivalent
was
a
disagreeable
man
to
interview
if
you
were
not
fortified
with
letters
of
introduction
even
then
he
proved
a
difficult
man
of
gusty
humours
He
was
however
amiable
to
me
after
I
told
him
I
was
a
Roman
Catholic
but
frowned
when
I
said
that
I
was
not
particularly
pious
Mais
mon
cher
confrere
he
groaned
vous
etes
un
imbecile
Quoi
No
half-way
epithet
for
him
I
admitted
my
imbecility
and
shifted
the
subject
to
Rops
the
etcher
of
Satanism
He
contemptuously
waved
the
artist
away
With
Maurice
Maeterlinck
it
was
different
for
the
Bel
gian
he
had
a
predilection
yet
that
poet
is
not
particu
larly
pious
I
sometimes
suspect
the
piety
of
Huys
mans
unhappy
man
who
died
a
horrible
death
cancer
in
the
throat
But
I
never
suspect
his
sincerity
which
as
Abbe
Mugnier
wrote
is
a
form
of
his
genius
Will
iam
James
abominated
the
writings
of
Huysmans
espe
cially
En
Route
and
in
one
of
his
letters
to
me
distinctly
doubted
the
sincerity
of
the
Frenchman
s
conversion
but
when
I
pointed
out
to
him
that
Huysmans
strictly
speaking
was
not
converted
but
had
only
returned
to
the
faith
in
which
he
had
been
baptised
and
when
I
assured
him
that
not
even
St
Augustine
or
John
Bun
yan
the
saintly
tinker
were
more
sincere
then
Pro
fessor
James
with
his
accustomed
charity
to
all
varia
tions
of
religious
belief
acknowledged
that
the
array
of
arguments
almost
persuaded
him
But
the
erotic
prepossessions
of
Huysmans
had
evidently
set
his
teeth
on
edge
In
the
summer
of
1896
I
attended
the
funeral
of
Edmond
de
Goncourt
the
last
of
the
famous
brothers
I
saw
contemporary
men
of
letters
painters
and
musi
cians
at
the
church
but
I
did
not
see
Paul
Verlaine
the
maker
of
music
as
exquisite
as
ethereal
as
Chopin
s
or
Shelley
s
also
Paul
Verlaine
the
poetic
souse
and
lyric
deadbeat
He
had
died
in
January
of
the
same
year
1896
I
had
often
gone
to
Leon
Vanier
s
book
shop
on
the
Quai
de
Notre
Dame
with
the
hope
of
meet
ing
the
most
extraordinary
poetic
apparition
since
Bau
delaire
but
without
success
Unsuccessful
too
were
my
visits
to
the
Cafe
Francois
Premier
on
Boulevard
St
Michel
usually
called
by
pasteboard
Bohemians
of
Greenwich
Village
and
Washington
Square
BouF
Miche
because
they
never
were
near
the
establish
ment
I
saw
but
not
there
some
of
the
younger
group
of
French
poets
also
the
Americans
who
wrote
beautiful
poetry
in
that
language
Viele-Griffin
and
Stuart
Merrill
who
occasionally
wrote
me
from
Forest
near
Brussels
till
a
few
years
before
his
death
But
I
never
met
Paul
Verlaine
Indeed
I
may
boast
that
I
am
the
only
living
writer
who
didn
t
lend
money
to
that
poet
Maeterlinck
s
Joyzelle
was
produced
at
the
Gym
nase
temporarily
renamed
Theatre
Maeterlinck
in
May
1903
This
Conte
d
Amour
had
as
heroine
Georgette
Leblanc
Veiling
her
temperament
this
singer
of
songs
of
Isolde
of
Melisande
became
gentle
nai
ve
poetic
but
she
was
also
feline
and
passionate
A
curious
artiste
at
times
a
woman
who
seems
to
step
from
a
page
of
Georges
Rodenbach
that
exquisite
Belgian
poet
the
poet
laureate
one
might
say
of
Bruges
have
you
read
his
Bruges-Ia-Morte
with
its
Poe-Iike
legend
of
the
dear
dead
woman
and
her
golden
strangling
hair
and
then
she
is
metamorphosed
into
the
double
of
the
old-time
Sarah
of
the
siren
voice
Oddly
enough
this
earlier
wife
of
Maeterlinck
is
the
sister
of
Maurice
Le
blanc
the
fabricator
of
the
thrilling
tale
of
Arsene
Lupin
In
his
admirably
designed
cabinet
Maeterlinck
gave
Arthur
Bles
and
myself
a
welcome
He
then
lived
on
the
Rue
Reynouard
in
a
house
the
garden
of
which
overlooks
the
Seine
from
the
moderate
heights
of
Passy
To
reach
his
apartment
we
had
to
traverse
a
twisted
courtyard
several
mysterious
staircases
built
on
the
corkscrew
model
and
finally
we
were
ushered
into
an
antechamber
full
of
fans
screens
old
engravings
orna
mental
brass
and
reproductions
from
pictures
by
Man
tegna
Rossetti
Burne
Jones
and
symbolistic
painters
Symbolism
was
going
out
Cubism
coming
in
The
King
is
dead
damn
the
Pretender
But
we
were
not
allowed
to
abide
there
A
maid
with
doubting
eyes
piloted
us
across
a
narrow
hallway
through
a
room
where
sat
a
tirewoman
altering
theatrical
costumes
and
at
last
we
were
in
the
presence
of
Maurice
Maeterlinck
Not
yet
Down
another
courtyard
where
he
loomed
up
in
cycling
costume
handsome
grave
cordial
with
big
Flemish
bones
a
round
head
with
wavy
hair
dappling
at
the
temples
Past
forty
a
pensive
man
he
didn
t
look
like
his
present
photograph
for
his
mustaches
were
un
shaved
He
was
older
more
vigorous
than
I
had
pic
tured
him
His
head
was
that
of
a
thinker
his
eyes
those
of
a
dreamer
Grey-blue
with
hints
of
green
they
were
melancholy
eyes
with
long
dark
lashes
He
was
modest
even
diffident
but
touch
on
a
favourite
theme
and
he
readily
reacts
He
would
not
speak
English
though
he
has
all
English
literature
stored
in
his
skull
His
genera
race
characteristics
are
Flemish
He
also
suggests
the
solid
Belgian
beef
and
beer
Like
some
mystics
he
believes
in
the
things
that
cheer
and
nourish
He
told
me
that
in
composing
Monna
Vanna
he
read
Sismondi
for
a
year
to
get
historical
colour
He
was
frank
as
to
the
conception
of
the
play
I
wrote
it
for
Madame
Maeterlinck
he
said
which
disposed
of
my
theory
that
the
piece
was
written
to
prove
he
knew
how
to
make
a
drama
on
conventional
lines
Nat
urally
I
read
Browning
who
does
not
Luria
I
have
known
for
a
long
time
but
it
is
not
a
stage
play
He
spoke
of
Shakespeare
as
other
men
speak
of
their
deity
I
was
interested
in
what
he
thought
of
The
Tempest
for
he
had
been
accused
by
some
critics
of
studying
that
immortal
fantasy
before
he
wrote
Joyzelle
Cer
tainly
I
did
I
simply
used
Shakespeare
as
a
point
of
departure
Could
I
do
better
And
then
how
can
any
one
speak
of
plagiarism
who
has
read
The
Tempest
and
has
seen
my
little
piece
M
Maeterlinck
is
open
minded
We
spoke
of
other
things
of
Poe
s
vague
troubled
beauty
of
Emerson
upon
whose
aphoristic
phil
osophy
he
sets
a
great
store
and
of
the
contemporary
theatre
Fearful
of
tiring
the
poet
we
went
away
again
across
courtyards
down
spiral
staircases
Seemingly
a
recluse
Maeterlinck
is
the
most
active
of
men
His
translation
of
Macbeth
into
French
is
the
best
I
have
read
Later
I
may
quote
from
some
of
his
letters
to
me
CRITICISM
For
at
least
five
years
in
London
1890-1895
I
wrote
for
the
London
Musical
Courier
a
page
or
two
weekly
entitled
the
Raconteur
It
was
signed
Through
it
I
came
to
know
many
musical
and
literary
people
there
I
was
slowly
discovering
that
to
become
successful
a
critic
can
t
wait
for
masterpieces
but
must
coddle
medi
ocrity
Otherwise
an
idle
pen
Big
talents
are
rare
so
you
must
to
hold
your
job
praise
conventional
patterns
And
that
way
leads
to
the
stifling
of
critical
values
Everyone
criticises
You
do
the
flower
that
reacts
to
the
sun
your
butcher
the
policeman
on
the
block
all
criticise
It
is
a
beloved
prerogative
The
difference
between
your
criticism
and
mine
is
that
I
am
paid
for
mine
and
you
must
pay
for
yours
after
you
hear
music
or
see
the
play
In
his
invaluable
studies
Criticism
and
Standards
William
Crary
Brownell
does
not
hold
with
the
Brunetiere
nor
with
the
Anatole
France
oppos
ing
schools
of
criticism
He
detects
the
doctrinaire
and
pedagogue
in
Brunetiere
and
he
rightly
enough
fears
the
tendency
towards
loose
thinking
in
the
camp
of
impres
sionistic
criticism
of
which
Anatole
France
is
the
recog
nised
head
Mr
Brownell
believes
in
central
authority
Yet
he
is
not
a
pontiff
He
allows
the
needful
scope
for
a
writer
s
individuality
It
s
all
very
well
to
describe
the
boating
of
your
soul
among
the
masterpieces
if
you
pos
sess
a
soul
comparable
to
the
soul
of
Anatole
France
but
yours
may
be
a
mean
little
soul
dwelling
up
some
back
alley
and
your
pen
a
lean
dull
one
Will
your
critical
adventures
be
worth
relating
The
epicurean
test
of
the
impressionist
is
not
a
standard
says
Mr
Brownell
since
what
gives
pleasure
to
some
gives
none
to
others
And
some
standard
is
a
necessary
postulate
not
only
of
criticism
but
of
all
discussion
or
even
discourse
He
asserts
that
criticism
is
an
art
One
of
Sainte-Beuve
s
studies
is
as
definitely
a
portrait
as
one
of
Holbein
s
The
creative
critic
of
Wilde
is
hardly
a
reality
There
are
no
super-critics
Only
men
cultured
and
clairvoyant
Sainte-Beuve
Taine
Nietzsche
Arnold
Pater
Benedetto
Croce
Georg
Brandes
and
this
Dane
is
the
most
cos
mopolitan
of
all
are
thinkers
and
literary
artists
It
is
perilously
easy
to
imitate
their
mannerisms
as
it
is
to
parody
the
unpoetic
parodies
of
Whitman
but
it
ends
there
A
little
humility
in
a
critic
is
a
wise
attitude
Humbly
to
follow
and
register
his
emotions
aroused
by
the
masterpiece
is
his
function
There
must
be
standards
but
the
two
greatest
are
sympathy
and
its
half-sister
sincerity
The
schoolmaster
rule
of
thumb
is
ridiculous
ridiculous
too
is
any
man
setting
up
an
effigy
of
himself
and
boasting
of
his
objectivity
The
happy
mean
be
tween
swashbuckling
criticism
and
the
pompous
academic
attitude
dull
but
dignified
seems
difficult
of
attainment
But
it
exists
To
use
the
personal
pronoun
in
criticism
doesn
t
always
mean
subjectivity
I
don
t
believe
in
schools
movements
or
schematologies
or
any
one
method
of
seeing
and
writing
Be
charitable
be
broad
in
a
word
be
cosmopolitan
He
is
a
hobby
of
mine
this
citizen
of
the
world
A
novelist
may
be
provincial
parochial
as
the
town
pump
that
is
his
picture
but
a
critic
must
not
be
narrow
in
his
outlook
on
the
world
He
need
not
be
so
catholic
as
to
admire
both
Cezanne
and
Cabanel
for
they
are
mutually
exclusive
but
he
should
be
cosmopolitan
in
his
sympathies
else
his
standards
are
insufficient
The
truth
is
criticism
is
a
full-sized
man
s
job
I
was
amused
some
years
ago
to
read
the
edict
of
some
young
Johnny
who
writes
hogwash
fiction
for
bone
heads
in
which
he
proclaimed
that
essay
writing
and
criticism
were
for
women
I
don
t
deny
they
are
but
our
uncritical
hero
whose
name
I
ve
forgotten
but
who
probably
turns
out
five
thousand
words
a
day
on
a
type
writer
meant
the
statement
in
a
derogatory
sense
The
literature
that
can
show
such
a
virile
essayist
as
Hazlitt
as
exquisite
as
Lamb
and
Alice
Meynell
to
men
tion
only
three
is
hardly
a
literature
that
needs
justifica
tion
And
what
of
Coleridge
De
Quincey
and
Ruskin
I
wrote
for
the
London
Saturday
Review
But
I
was
growing
tired
of
music
and
drama
from
the
critical
standpoint
Books
too
were
getting
on
my
nerves
There
is
a
lot
of
nonsense
written
about
the
evil
that
a
book
may
accomplish
Books
never
kill
even
their
vaunted
influence
is
limited
else
what
vases
of
iniquity
would
be
the
reviewers
I
confess
I
even
doubt
the
value
of
so-called
constructive
criticism
Interpreters
of
music
drama
paint
marble
poetry
and
prose
write
nice
little
letters
to
critics
assuring
them
that
such
and
such
a
critique
changed
their
conception
of
such
and
such
a
work
I
am
sceptical
You
tickle
an
artist
in
print
and
he
flatters
you
in
private
I
have
known
of
prima
donnas
that
send
flowers
to
the
wives
of
critics
but
that
is
too
obvious
a
proceeding
also
too
expensive
The
reason
I
don
t
believe
artists
of
the
theatre
opera
or
the
plastic
arts
ever
alter
artist
s
schemes
of
interpreta
tion
is
because
they
couldn
t
do
it
if
they
tried
I
don
t
mean
that
he
or
she
doesn
t
broaden
with
experience
polish
comes
with
practice
but
I
doubt
those
radical
changes
which
some
critics
pretend
to
have
brought
about
with
their
omniscient
pens
In
the
case
of
no
bodies
or
mediocrities
who
never
make
up
their
mind
to
a
definite
conception
it
may
be
different
Great
artists
are
secretly
contemptuous
of
what
amateurs
meaning
critics
may
say
of
them
no
matter
the
thickness
of
the
butter
they
spread
on
the
critic
s
bread
A
book
review
didn
t
kill
John
Keats
Criticism
is
an
inverted
form
of
love
The
chief
thing
to
the
public
performer
whether
in
the
pulpit
or
politics
is
neither
blame
nor
praise
but
the
mention
of
their
names
in
print
The
mud
or
the
treacle
is
soon
forgotten
The
name
sticks
There
is
a
large
element
of
charlatanism
in
everyone
who
earns
his
living
before
the
footlights
of
life
Ah
the
Art
of
Pub
licity
In
his
peculiarly
amiable
manner
George
Bernard
Shaw
once
reproached
me
with
being
a
hero-worshipper
of
the
sort
who
not
finding
his
idol
precisely
as
he
had
pictured
him
promptly
tweaks
pagan-wise
his
sacred
nose
George
probably
thought
of
me
as
a
pie-eyed
youth
who
was
all
roses
and
raptures
one
who
couldn
t
see
through
the
exceedingly
large
rift
in
the
Shavian
mill
stone
He
changed
his
mind
later
But
I
am
a
hero
worshipper
I
have
a
large
fund
of
admiration
for
the
achievements
of
men
and
women
and
I
can
admire
Mr
Shaw
simply
because
he
so
admires
his
own
bright
par
ticular
deity
Himself
But
I
can
t
go
off
half-trigger
if
the
target
is
not
to
my
taste
Many
times
I
have
been
dragged
to
the
well
and
couldn
t
be
made
to
drink
not
because
of
the
water
therein
but
that
I
wasn
t
thirsty
I
have
with
all
my
boasted
cosmopolitanism

Dr
Fells
the
reason
why
I
can
not
tell
It
was
with
difficulty
I
read
Arnold
Bennett
notwithstanding
the
joy
he
gave
me
in
Buried
Alive
yet
I
couldn
t
swallow
Old
Wives
Tale
the
hiss
ing

of
s
s
nor
that
dull
epic
Clayhanger
Mr
Bennett
whose
touch
is
Gallic
who
is
first
and
last
a
trained
newspaper
man
is
out
of
his
depth
in
the
artistic
territory
of
Tolstoy
and
Hardy
He
is
not
a
literary
artist
like
George
Moore
or
John
Galsworthy
But
Mr
Bennett
enthralled
me
with
his
The
Pretty
Lady
an
evocation
artistically
evoked
So
thus
I
had
to
reverse
a
too
hasty
judgment
upon
Arnold
Bennett
whose
re
sources
are
evidently
not
exhausted
When
Mr
Wells
writes
a
new
book
I
always
take
down
one
of
his
earlier
ones
I
can
t
believe
in
those
silhouettes
that
he
pro
jects
across
his
pages
with
the
velocity
of
moving
pictures
They
are
not
altogether
human
those
men
and
women
who
talk
a
jumble
of
Meredithese
and
social
science
But
how
the
wheels
whiz
round
I
don
t
be
lieve
in
them
I
don
t
believe
in
Machiavel
or
Tono
Bungay
or
Mr
Britling
or
that
absurd
Bishop
above
all
I
don
t
believe
in
the
god
with
a
lower-case
g
of
Mr

A

a

WITH
JOSEPH
CONRAD
One
afternoon
years
ago
Stephen
Crane
sat
in
the
Everett
House
dining-room
We
looked
out
on
Union
Square
The
author
of
The
Red
Badge
of
Courage
asked
me
if
I
had
read
anything
by
Joseph
Conrad
a
friend
of
his
a
Polish
sea-captain
who
was
writing
the
most
wonderful
things
in
English
That
was
the
first
time
I
heard
Conrad
s
name
When
I
went
to
see
him
in
England
I
found
a
photograph
of
Stephen
Crane
on
his
desk
The
Conrads
loved
the
American
writer
who
had
often
visited
them
I
thought
of
Crane
when
I
left
London
one
foggy
morning
to
go
down
to
Kent
invited
by
Conrad
and
I
also
thought
of
Mr
Shaw
for
Joseph
Conrad
had
become
the
object
of
my
hero-worship
nor
has
the
worship
waned
with
the
years
quite
the
contrary
His
royal
command
to
visit
him
stirred
my
imagina
tion
The
mirror
of
the
sea
master
of
prose
though
writing
in
a
foreign
language
possessing
a
style
large
sonorous
picture-evoking
as
microscopic
in
his
analysis
as
Paul
Bourget
as
exotic
as
Pierre
Loti
without
the
egotism
of
that
essentially
feminine
soul
withal
a
Slav
when
he
most
seems
an
Englishman
Joseph
Conrad
is
the
unique
weaver
of
magic
variations
on
that
most
tre
mendous
theme
the
sea
I
was
summoned
as
I
say
to
his
country
home
in
Kent
and
in
the
most
cordial
fashion
I
had
not
expected
a
typhoon
blast
in
the
form
of
an
invitation
nevertheless
from
the
writer
of
The
Nigger
of
the
Narcissus
I
had
looked
for
something
more
nautical
something
like
this
What
ho
luff
to
and
run
your
miserable
little
writing
yawl
into
my
harbour
and
don
t
be
slow
about
it
blast
your
buttons
But
I
had
forgotten
that
I
was
about
to
visit
Joseph
Conrad
and
not
the
merry
Mr
Jacobs
and
his
many
cargoes
Kent
is
charming
Kent
is
hospitable
But
it
consumed
all
of
two
hours
to
reach
a
remote
station
called
Hamstreet
after
changing
at
Ashford
A
motor-car
met
me
I
thought
again
of
Mr
Shaw
If
it
had
been
a
hydro-airplane
or
a
steam
launch
I
shouldn
t
have
been
surprised
but
a
motor
car
and
Conrad
didn
t
modulate
which
proves
the
folly
of
preconceived
notions
I
had
seen
protographs
of
Mr
Conrad
mature
bearded
with
commanding
eyes
a
master-mariner
as
well
as
a
master-psychologist
Would
he
resemble
his
portraits
Of
course
not
and
I
prepared
for
the
worst
I
was
delightfully
disappointed
At
the
door
of
his
farmhouse
as
he
calls
it
I
met
a
man
of
the
world
neither
sailor
nor
novelist
just
a
simple
mannered
gentleman
whose
welcome
was
sincere
whose
glance
was
veiled
at
times
far-away
whose
ways
were
French
Polish
anything
but
literary
bluff
or
English
He
is
not
as
tall
as
he
seems
He
is
restless
He
paces
an
imaginary
quarter-deck
occasionally
peers
through
the
windows
as
if
searching
the
horizon
for
news
of
the
weather
A
caged
sea-lion
His
shoulder-shrug
and
play
of
hands
are
Gallic
or
Polish
as
you
will
and
his
eyes
clouded
or
shining
are
not
of
the
Anglo-Saxon
race
they
are
Slavic
even
the
slightly
muffled
voice
is
Slavic
One
of
the
most
beautiful
sounding
of
languages
is
Polish
the
French
of
the
North
When
Mr
Conrad
speaks
English
which
he
does
swiftly
and
with
clearness
of
enun
elation
you
may
hear
rather
overhear
the
foreign
cadence
the
soft
slurring
of
sibilants
characteristic
of
Polish
speech
He
is
more
foreign
looking
than
I
had
expected
He
fluently
speaks
French
and
he
often
lapsed
into
it
during
our
conversation
And
like
other
big
men
he
asked
more
questions
than
he
answered
supersubtle
Sarmatian
that
he
is
But
his
curiosity
is
prompted
by
boundless
sympathy
for
things
human
He
is
as
you
must
have
surmised
the
most
lovable
of
men
He
takes
an
interest
in
everything
save
bad
art
which
moves
him
to
vibrating
indignation
and
he
is
sympathetic
when
speaking
of
the
work
of
his
contem
poraries
What
a
lesson
for
critics
with
a
barbed-wire
method
would
be
the
opinions
of
Mr
Conrad
on
art
and
artists
Naturally
he
has
his
gods
his
half-gods
his
major
detestations
The
Bible
and
Flaubert
were
his
companions
throughout
the
years
he
voyaged
in
southern
seas
from
holy
writ
he
absorbed
his
racy
idiomatic
and
diapasonic
English
from
the
sonorous
shining
prose
of
the
great
French
writer
he
learned
the
art
of
writing
sen
tences
their
comely
shape
and
varied
rhythmic
gait
their
sound
colour
perfume
the
passionate
music
of
words
their
hateful
and
harmonic
power
He
studied
other
masters
Balzac
and
the
Russians
Henry
James
has
written
of
the
effect
produced
on
his
French
fellow
craftsmen
by
Ivan
Turgenev
His
Gallic
side
a
side
frequently
shown
by
Russians
they
appreciated
his
philosophical
German
training
they
understood
but
the
vast
mysterious
reservoir
of
his
Slavic
temperament
was
for
them
non-existent
So
close
a
friend
as
Flaubert
was
unresponsive
to
the
rarest
in
Turgenev
At
this
juncture
I
can
t
help
thinking
of
Conrad
No
prophet
has
been
more
envied
out
of
his
own
country
His
fellow
artists
Hardy
Kipling
Galsworthy
Arthur
Symons
the
late
Henry
James
and
the
younger
choir
were
and
are
his
admirers
His
critics
are
sometimes
extravagant
in
their
praise
of
his
art
yet
I
haven
t
thus
far
read
a
critique
that
gives
me
a
sense
of
finality
They
miss
his
Slavic
side
else
are
repelled
by
it
And
irony
an
unforgivable
offence
Mr
Shaw
found
out
that
fact
early
in
the
game
and
always
uses
a
bludgeon
that
is
why
he
is
called
subtle
in
England
and
America
when
he
is
drawing
blood
with
the
blunt
edge
of
his
razor
Conrad
is
nothing
if
not
ironical
His
irony
is
an
illu
minating
model
for
the
elect
but
it
has
not
endeared
him
to
the
public
and
to
certain
critics
What
havoc
was
wrought
on
the
appearance
of
Under
Western
Eyes
which
might
have
been
written
by
Turgenev
so
far
as
its
verbal
artistry
and
planned
by
Dostoievsky
because
of
its
profound
characterisation
and
mystic
power
yet
it
is
unlike
any
book
by
either
of
the
two
Russians
Its
almost
malign
ironical
mode
has
been
seldom
noted
we
were
only
informed
by
the
pens
of
presumptuous
young
persons
principally
in
petticoats
that
Under
Western
Eyes
is
a
copy
of
The
Crime
and
The
Punish
ment
when
it
is
the
most
searching
arraignment
of
Rus
sian
tyranny
Russian
bureaucracy
which
is
the
same
thing
ever
written
But
in
the
quiet
inferential
Con
rad
key
A
Pole
he
hates
Russia
as
hated
its
miserable
Czar-crowned
rule
Frederic
Chopin
And
like
Chopin
Conrad
buries
his
cannon
in
flowers
That
is
the
clue
to
this
great
fiction
a
Dostoievsky
reversed
a
contemner
not
an
apologist
of
the
Russian
Government
I
have
told
you
that
I
loved
Polish
art
and
Joseph
Conrad
is
another
of
my
idols
He
is
pre-eminently
versatile
and
in
the
back
garden
of
his
culture
in
the
enormous
storehouse
of
his
experi
ences
there
flits
betimes
an
uneasy
shadow
an
ogre
that
threatens
it
is
his
Slavic
temperament
He
would
not
be
Polish
and
a
man
of
genius
if
the
Polish
ZaI
was
not
in
his
writings
in
his
gaze
and
speech
that
half-desire
half-melancholy
that
half-yearning
half-sorrow
a
divine
discontent
not
to
be
expressed
in
a
phrase
unless
it
be
in
the
magical
phrase
of
his
countryman
Chopin
The
existence
of
Conrad
has
been
too
close
to
the
soil
not
to
have
heard
the
humming
of
the
human
heart
and
its
overtones
The
elemental
things
are
his
chief
con
cern
not
the
doings
of
dolls
He
is
not
a
propagandist
He
never
tries
to
prove
anything
He
is
the
artist
pure
and
simple
He
has
followed
the
ancient
injunction
to
look
into
his
heart
and
write
he
the
most
objective
of
artists
with
the
clairvoyance
of
a
seer
Nevertheless
his
true
happiness
lies
nearer
the
core
of
his
nature
the
love
of
his
family
For
certain
young
writers
this
hu
man
trait
may
seem
banal
Any
butcher
or
policeman
can
love
his
wife
and
children
Art
is
a
jealous
mistress
we
are
told
by
pale
youths
who
wearily
look
down
upon
a
stupid
world
from
their
ivory
towers
It
was
the
un
happy
Marie
Bashkirtseff
who
said
that
her
washer
woman
could
breed
children
so
there
was
nothing
to
boast
about
maternity
Mr
Conrad
thinks
otherwise
He
is
not
only
a
great
writer
but
a
loving
father
and
husband
that
classic
obituary
phrase
There
is
no
paradox
here
It
is
because
he
is
so
human
that
helps
him
to
be
so
masterful
a
writer
He
can
pluck
the
strings
of
pity
terror
irony
and
humour
and
draw
re
sounding
music
from
them
But
if
you
speak
of
him
as
a
literary
man
he
waves
you
an
emphatic
negative
He
admires
literary
virtuosity
but
does
not
often
in
dulge
in
it
He
admires
Anatole
France
but
in
the
prac
tice
of
his
own
art
he
is
the
opposite
of
that
velvety
sophist
He
takes
pride
in
his
profession
yet
is
free
from
vanity
or
self-seeking
indeed
he
is
far
from
being
a
practical
man
This
worries
him
more
than
it
does
his
friends
and
the
fact
that
he
is
not
a
well
man
is
another
thorn
in
his
flesh
For
months
at
a
time
he
is
tortured
by
rheumatic
gout
which
illness
keeps
him
from
his
desk
thereat
much
wrath
and
many
regrets
However
the
optimistic
spirit
of
the
great
artist
shines
through
the
mists
of
his
pessimism
In
his
reminiscences
you
will
find
a
veracious
account
of
his
childhood
and
his
early
passion
for
the
sea
Later
in
the
afternoon
of
my
visit
he
astonished
me
by
transforming
himself
into
an
Englishman
He
sported
a
monocle
and
his
expression
was
haughty
as
he
drove
his
car
over
the
smooth
Kentish
roads
The
Slav
had
disappeared
He
spoke
no
more
of
art
but
dwelt
on
his
gout
his
poor
man
s
gout
as
he
smilingly
called
it
Too
soon
I
was
standing
on
the
platform
of
Ashford
station
en
route
for
London
Conrad
is
only
one
of
his
names
his
family
belongs
to
the
Polish
nobility
but
the
mag
netism
of
the
waters
drew
him
to
the
sea
in
ships
and
only
accidentally
did
he
become
a
writer
Accident
Chance
It
is
a
leading
motive
of
his
fiction
One
night
sitting
in
a
cafe
in
Ghent
Maurice
Maeterlinck
con
versed
with
his
friend
Charles
Van
Lerberghe
a
Belgian
writer
of
originality
and
that
same
conversation
proved
a
springboard
for
the
art
of
the
younger
man
Van
Lerberghe
indicated
Maeterlinck
developed
Chance

Joseph

BRANDES
IN
NEW
YORK
When
I
saw
Dr
Georg
Brandes
at
the
Hotel
Astor
a
few
months
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
I
told
him
that
he
resembled
the
bust
of
him
by
Klinger
It
was
the
first
time
that
I
had
seen
the
famous
Danish
author
to
whom
I
dedicated
Egoists
Past
seventy
then
as
active
as
a
youth
I
saw
no
reason
why
he
shouldn
t
live
to
be
a
centenarian
An
active
brain
is
lodged
in
his
nimble
body
I
had
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
him
no
questions
about
America
I
found
him
in
a
rage
over
the
manner
in
which
he
was
misrepresented
by
his
interviewers
It
should
be
remembered
that
primarily
he
is
a
cosmopolitan
He
writes
in
English
Danish
French
and
German
with
equal
ease
As
to
the
provinciality
of
our
country
in
the
matter
of
art
and
literature
he
has
definite
opinions
but
he
was
polite
enough
not
to
rub
them
in
on
me
He
was
accused
by
some
rough-rider
cub
reporter
of
finding
his
favourite
reading
in
the
works
of
Jack
London
That
amused
him
Poe
Emerson
and
Whitman
inter
ested
him
though
not
as
pathfinders
or
iconoclasts
The
originality
of
this
trinity
he
failed
to
recognise
made-over
Europeans
he
called
them
Emerson
and
German
transcendental
philosophy
Poe
and
E
T
W
Hoffman
Whitman
and
Ossian
Even
Walt
s
rugged
speech
is
a
parody
of
MacPherson
s
and
Ossian
himself
is
a
windy
parody
of
the
Old
Testament
style
Brandes
is
an
iconoclast
a
radical
a
born
non-conformist
and
oftener
a
No-Sayer
than
a
Yes-Sayer
The
many-headed
monster
has
no
message
for
him
As
he
was
the
first
European
critic
to
give
us
a
true
picture
of
Ibsen
and
Nietzsche
I
led
him
to
speak
of
Nietzsche
Once
at
Baireuth
where
I
went
many
times
to
hear
the
Wagner
music-drama
at
the
fountainhead
and
often
muddy
was
the
music-making
I
am
sorry
to
say
I
was
shown
the
house
of
Max
Stirner
by
a
friend
who
said
When
the
name
and
music
of
Wagner
is
forgotten
Stirner
s
will
be
in
the
mouth
of
the
world
I
pricked
up
my
ears
at
this
I
knew
Stirner
s
extraordinary
book
The
Ego
and
His
Own
knew
his
real
name
Johann
Kaspar
Schmitt
imprisoned
by
the
Prussian
Government
This
intel
lectual
anarch
rather
call
him
nihilist
for
compared
with
his
nihilism
Bakunine
s
is
revolutionary
rhetoric
was
to
become
the
mightiest
force
in
civilisation
I
couldn
t
believe
it
This
was
in
1896
But
in
1919
I
re
call
my
friend
s
prophecy
when
I
read
of
the
Bolsheviki
in
Russia
Not
Nietzsche
but
Max
Stirner
has
been
the
motor-force
in
the
new
revolution
No
half-way
house
of
socialism
for
the
Reds
That
is
the
lesson
of
Artzi
bachev
s
Sanine
which
most
critics
missed
partially
because
of
an
imperfect
English
translation
whole
key
note
chapters
suppressed
and
also
because
they
did
not
note
the
significance
of
the
new
man
who
while
continu
ing
the
realistic
tradition
of
Dostoievsky
and
Tolstoy
was
diametrically
opposed
to
their
sentimental
Brother
hood
of
Man
humbug
and
preached
the
fiercest
indi
vidualism
while
repudiating
Nietzsche
and
his
aristo
cratic
individualism
Dr
Brandes
sets
more
store
by
Nietzsche
than
Stirner
and
was
the
first
to
apply
to
Nietzsche
the
appellation
of
radical
aristocrat
He
did
not
think
that
Nietzsche
had
access
to
Stirner
s
The
Ego
and
His
Own
I
believe
the
opposite
I
know
he
had
and
there
is
a
brochure
published
by
a
learned
Swiss
which
proves
the
fact
However
the
man
who
called
the
Germans
the
Chinese
of
Europe
wasn
t
Stirner
It
was
Nietzsche
When
we
switched
to
August
Strindberg
of
whom
I
wrote
at
length
in
Iconoclasts
Dr
Brandes
remarked
Yes
he
was
mad
Once
he
visited
me
and
related
how
he
had
called
at
a
lunatic
asylum
near
Stockholm
He
rang
the
bell
and
asked
the
physician
if
he
Strindberg
were
crazy
to
which
the
doctor
replied
My
dear
Mr
Strind
berg
if
you
will
only
consent
to
stay
with
me
for
six
weeks
and
talk
with
me
every
day
I
promise
to
answer
your
question
After
that
Brandes
had
no
doubts
And
then
Strindberg
s
wild
ideas
about
Ibsen
he
was
convinced
that
Ibsen
had
taken
him
for
the
model
of
Ekdal
the
erratic
photographer
in
The
Wild
Duck
Brandes
considers
Miss
Julie
the
best
play
of
Strindberg
I
amused
him
by
telling
how
I
had
gone
to
Stockholm
sixteen
years
ago
to
interview
the
Swedish
poet
and
dramatist
I
saw
him
once
for
two
minutes
It
was
after
midnight
and
he
stood
in
his
lighted
window
and
cursed
me
cursed
the
lady
with
me
who
had
aroused
him
by
throwing
gravel
at
his
bedroom
window
and
then
he
disappeared
in
a
blue
haze
of
profanity
It
was
gently
explained
to
me
that
one
reason
for
his
bad
humour
and
for
the
rift
in
the
matrimonial
lute
he
had
three
or
four
such
lutes
was
the
knowledge
that
his
third
wife
had
played
Nora
in
A
Doll
s
House
the
night
I
had
called
on
him
Which
was
unfortunate
for
me
Strindberg
hated
Ibsen
which
hatred
was
not
returned
quite
the
contrary
Ibsen
is
said
to
have
admired
Strind
berg
s
versatility
and
bursts
of
dramatic
power
Brandes
is
not
alone
the
discoverer
of
Ibsen
Nietzsche
and
Strindberg
but
he
is
himself
a
re
valuer
of
old
valua
tions
Therein
lies
his
significance
for
this
generation
He
wrote
to
Nietzsche
in
1888
I
have
been
the
best
hated
man
in
the
North
for
the
past
four
years
The
newspapers
rave
against
me
every
day
especially
since
my
last
long
feud
with
Bjornson
in
which
all
the
Moral
German
newspapers
take
sides
against
me
Perhaps
you
know
Bjornson
s
insipid
drama
The
Glove
and
have
heard
of
his
propaganda
for
the
virginity
of
men
and
his
league
with
the
women
advocates
who
demand
moral
equality
In
Sweden
the
crazy
young
things
have
formed
themselves
into
large
societies
promising
to
marry
only
virgin
young
men
I
presume
they
will
get
them
guaranteed
like
watches
but
there
will
be
no
guar
anteeing
for
the
future
There
you
have
a
specimen
of
the
hitting
out
from
the
shoulder
by
this
Dane
He
be
lieves
in
the
vote
for
women
but
dislikes
the
moral
hum
buggery
and
sentimental
flimflam
which
everywhere
per
meates
the
movement
He
knows
as
all
sensible
women
know
that
the
vote
will
not
prove
a
panacea
for
the
wrongs
of
their
sex
the
chief
one
seeming
to
be
in
their
eyes
the
fact
that
they
are
born
women
and
not
men
nor
will
it
add
one
cubit
to
their
physical
or
men
tal
stature
Dr
Brandes
is
an
uncompromising
indi
vidualist
Men
or
women
must
work
out
their
moral
salvation
and
movements
laws
majorities
will
not
help
in
fact
will
impede
personal
development
The
affections
of
Brandes
have
always
been
bestowed
on
the
literatures
of
England
and
France
Consider
his
Modern
Spirits
studies
of
Renan
Flaubert
Turgenev
Goncourt
or
his
work
on
Shakespeare
or
his
Main
Cur
rents
in
the
Literature
of
the
Nineteenth
Century
of
which
a
French
critic
Maurice
Bigeon
has
said
that
Brandes
did
for
his
century
what
Sainte-Beuve
did
for
the
seventeenth
century
in
his
History
of
Port-Royal
And
how
many
flies
large
and
small
there
are
imbedded
in
the
amber
of
the
Brandes
style
He
is
of
Jewish
origin
and
like
his
parents
not
orthodox
Christians
call
him
a
Jew
while
orthodox
Jews
will
have
none
of
him
He
little
cares
no
doubt
crying
a
plague
on
both
their
houses
But
he
fights
for
his
race
he
repeatedly
attacked
Russia
for
its
treatment
of
the
Jew
and
he
has
always
been
disliked
in
Germany
for
his
trenchant
ar
raignment
of
the
Schleswig-Holstein
incident
He
has
combated
the
eternal
imbecility
of
mankind
fighting
like
all
independent
thinkers
on
the
losing
side
The
war
with
Prussia
in
1
864
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
young
man
He
was
born
in
1842
It
opened
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
Latin
genius
was
more
akin
to
the
Danish
than
the
Germanic
In
1866
he
visited
Paris
and
fell
under
the
spell
of
French
culture
When
the
war
of
time
his
mind
mirror-like
reflected
many
characteristics
of
contemporary
thinkers
He
had
already
met
John
Stuart
Mill
and
translated
him
into
Danish
The
hard
positivism
of
the
Englishman
he
was
never
wholly
to
lose
luckily
it
was
tempered
by
his
acquaintance
with
Taine
and
Renan
What
is
vital
what
makes
for
prog
ress
what
has
lasting
influence
in
social
life
he
asks
in
his
Main
Currents
With
his
Hebraic
irony
he
stung
the
intellectual
sloth
of
Denmark
to
the
quick
His
life
was
made
unpleasant
at
the
Copenhagen
University
but
he
had
the
younger
generation
behind
him
He
knew
that
to
write
for
the
entrenched
prejudiced
class
would
be
a
waste
of
ink
He
exploded
his
bomb
beneath
the
na
tional
ark
and
blew
sky-high
conservative
ideals
He
not
only
became
a
national
figure
but
a
world-critic
Not
the
polished
artistic
writer
that
is
Sainte-Beuve
not
the
possessor
of
such
a
synthetic
intellect
as
Taine
s
Georg
Brandes
is
the
cosmopolitan
thinker
par
excellence
and
on
his
shoulders
their
mantles
have
fallen
He
will
re
main
the
archetype
of
cosmopolitan
critics
for
future
generations
It
is
of
him
I
think
when
I
preach
breadth
in
criticism
and
while
he
is
not
a
specialist
in
art
or
music
his
culture
is
broad
enough
to
embrace
their
values
A
humanist
the
mind
of
Brandes
is
steel-col
oured
When
white-hot
it
is
ductile
it
flows
like
lava
from
an
eruptive
volcano
but
always
is
it
steel
whether
rigid
or
liquefied
It
is
pre-eminently
the
fighting
mind
He
objected
to
being
described
as
brilliant
He
must
hate
the
word
as
I
m
sure
Bernard
Shaw
does
When
all
other
adjectives
fail
then
brilliant
is
lugged
in
to
do
duty
at
a
funeral
or
a
marriage
and
no
doubt
at
bril
liant
obstetrical
events
The
model
of
Brandes
as
a
portrait-painter
of
individuals
and
ideas
is
Velasquez
because
Velasquez
is
not
brilliant
but
true
Yet
he
is
brilliant
and
steel-like
and
lucid
whether
writing
of
Lassalle
or
Shakespeare
or
Poland
His
Impressions
of
Russia
barred
him
from
that
country
If
the
powers
that
be
had
listened
in
1914
to
the
denunciations
and
warnings
of
Brandes
and
Israel
Zangwill
certain
dis
asters
might
not
have
come
to
pass
in
Russia
An
ardent
upholder
of
Taine
and
the
psychology
of
race
he
con
tends
that
in
the
individual
not
the
mob
is
the
only
hope
for
progress
He
is
all
for
the
psychology
of
the
individual
Like
Carlyle
he
has
the
cult
of
the
great
man
The
fundamental
question
is
can
the
well-being
of
the
race
which
is
the
end
of
all
effort
be
attained
without
great
men
I
say
no
and
again
no
he
cries
He
is
a
firm
believer
that
every
tub
should
stand
on
its
own
bottom
and
in
this
earthly
pasture
where
the
sheep
think
and
vote
to
order
his
lesson
is
writ
clear
To
thyself
be
true
the
lesson
set
forth
with
double
facets
by
Ibsen
in
Peer
Gynt
and
Brand
And
also
by
Emerson
For
mob
and
mob-made
laws
Georg
Brandes
has
a
mighty
hatred
He
is
a
radical
aristocrat
whose
motto
might
be
Blessed
are
the
proud
of
spirit
for
they
shall
inherit
the
Kingdom
of
Earth
Agitated
as
he
is
by
the
Great
War
his
letters
to
me
were
full
of
it
he
was
philosopher
enough
to
plunge
into
philosophical
work
and
he
has
written
since
1914
two
profound
works
on
such
divergent
themes
as
Goethe
and
Voltaire
both
of
which
will
be
given
an
English
garb
when
a
more
pro
pitious
period
arrives
THE
COLONEL
I
was
not
precisely
summoned
to
Oyster
Bay
on
election
day
early
in
November
1915
but
I
took
Colonel
Roosevelt
s
invitation
in
the
light
of
a
royal
command
and
went
down
in
company
with
John
Quinn
who
had
arranged
the
affair
and
Francis
Heney
formerly
public
prosecutor
in
San
Francisco
I
had
received
several
let
ters
from
the
Colonel
of
Colonels
of
which
I
recall
two
sentences
One
was
What
a
trump
John
Quinn
is
the
other
I
have
just
received
New
Cosmopolis
my
son
Kermit
whose
special
delight
is
New
York
would
probably
appreciate
it
more
than
I
do
for
I
am
a
coun
tryman
rather
than
a
man
of
the
pavements
Now
I
had
always
thought
of
Theodore
Roosevelt
as
a
man
of
the
pavements
despite
his
delight
in
rough-riding
over
Western
prairies
Personally
I
found
him
the
reverse
of
either
a
scholarly
man
fond
of
the
arts
he
has
a
num
ber
of
pictures
by
the
late
Marcius
Simons
a
young
American
painter
who
had
been
influenced
by
Turner
He
has
an
excellent
library
of
Colonial
literature
and
is
fond
of
digging
out
pregnant
sentences
from
early
preach
ers
and
statesmen
He
showed
me
some
of
the
trophies
he
had
acquired
in
Europe
while
on
his
Grand
Tour
One
was
a
photograph
of
the
late
Andrew
Carnegie
taken
in
Berlin
during
military
manoeuvres
Both
Colonel
Roosevelt
and
Mr
Carnegie
were
guests
of
Kaiser
Wil
helm
On
the
photograph
the
Kaiser
had
politely
scrib
bled
That
old
fool
Andrew
Carnegie
probably
allud
ing
to
the
projected
Peace
Palace
at
The
Hague
Young
Philip
Roosevelt
was
visiting
his
uncle
that
day
I
had
previously
met
him
War
was
discussed
by
the
Colonel
with
the
zest
he
displayed
to
the
last
I
told
him
that
I
had
been
present
at
the
formal
opening
of
the
Peace
Palace
in
September
1913
at
The
Hague
and
that
the
day
was
so
hot
that
all
Holland
fled
to
the
beach
at
Scheveningen
adding
that
I
believed
the
palace
would
eventually
be
turned
into
the
finest
cafe
in
Europe
And
I
printed
this
prophecy
in
the
New
York
Times
in
my
reporting
of
the
hollow
mockery
One
question
I
permitted
myself
Colonel
would
the
Lusitania
have
been
sunk
if
you
had
been
in
the
White
House
Snap
ping
that
formidable
jaw
of
his
he
exclaimed
I
don
t
think
there
would
have
been
a
Lusitania
incident
if
I
had
been
President
I
believed
him
John
Quinn
to
whom
he
referred
is
I
need
hardly
tell
you
an
art
collector
and
a
well-known
barrister
in
New
York
His
collection
is
rich
in
modern
pictures
from
Puvis
de
Chavannes
to
Augustus
John
and
Picasso
I
saw
Henry
Ward
Beecher
once
on
Fulton
Street
near
the
ferry
He
had
the
mask
of
a
tragic
actor
the
jowls
heavy
the
eyes
wonderful
in
expression
This
virile
clergyman
and
patriot
has
a
statue
erected
to
his
memory
in
Brooklyn
Which
is
just
Setting
aside
his
services
for
the
cause
of
liberty
during
the
war
of
emancipation
did
he
not
enrich
English
speech
with
such
racy
phrases
as
nest-hiding
on
the
ragged
edge
and
the
parox
ysmal
kiss
With
the
solitary
exception
of
Walt
Whit
man
no
man
has
come
out
of
Brooklyn
who
could
write
such
powerful
words
Henry
James
I
only
saw
once
and
then
as
he
stepped
on
the
lift
he
saluted
me
as
Good
by
Mr
Scribner
It
was
at
the
publishing
house
of
Scribners
then
on
Fifth
Avenue
below
Twenty-second
Street
My
shaven
face
and
glasses
must
have
deceived
him
Still
for
a
poor
devil
of
an
author
to
be
taken
for
one
of
his
publishers
was
after
all
achieving
something
in
literature
Another
great
man
that
I
saw
and
only
once
was
the
poet
Swinburne
It
was
during
a
Channel
crossing
I
had
encountered
Heinrich
Conried
not
then
manager
of
our
Opera
House
in
Dieppe
and
he
was
so
seasick
that
I
was
alarmed
fearing
he
would
collapse
Swinburne
did
not
look
cheerful
himself
and
for
a
poet
who
so
rapturously
celebrates
the
sea
I
fancied
he
felt
rather
seedy
certainly
he
hugged
the
rail
The
water
was
very
rough
I
should
like
to
have
gone
closer
to
have
touched
his
hand
and
cried
Thalassa
but
his
eyes
were
distraught
his
locks
dank
and
with
a
shawl
around
his
slim
shoulders
he
was
far
from
a
heroic
spectacle
Swinburne
looked
less
like
a
poet
than
Arthur
Symons
who
in
the
old
days
was
poetical
in
appearance
DRAMATIC
CRITICS
When
I
began
writing
about
the
theatre
the
principal
critics
of
the
drama
were
William
Winter
of
The
Tribune
Weeping
Willie
as
Charlie
McLellan
nicknamed
him
because
of
his
lachrymose
lyrical
propensities
Edward
A
Dithmar
of
The
Times
who
literally
made
Richard
Mansfield
Nym
Crinkle
of
The
World
in
private
life
Andrew
C
Wheeler
an
able
writer
Alan
Dale
Alfred
Cohen
of
The
Evening
World
later
with
The
Morning
Journal
now
The
American
Steinberg
of
The
Herald
Franklin
Fyles
of
The
Sun
Willy
von
Sachs
of
The
Commercial
Advertiser
John
Ranken
Towse
then
as
now
dramatic
editor
of
The
Evening
Post
Charles
Dil
lingham
and
Acton
Davies
of
The
Evening
Sun
Mr
Dillingham
soon
graduated
into
the
managerial
ranks
C
M
S
McLellan
was
the
wittiest
of
all
and
his
theatri
cal
column
in
Town
Topics
was
worth
reading
though
it
stabbed
some
one
in
every
sentence
I
have
told
you
of
The
Recorder
and
its
fortunes
Lawrence
Reamer
who
has
been
with
The
Sun
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
wrote
with
equal
ease
musical
and
dramatic
criticism
As
I
have
already
told
you
I
followed
Mr
Fyles
in
1902
as
dramatic
critic
of
The
Sun
William
Winter
was
the
most
poetic
and
erudite
of
critics
For
years
he
wrote
with
un
flagging
vivacity
English
undefiled
and
musical
to
the
ear
He
was
unfair
to
visiting
artists
unless
of
English
origin
He
nearly
strangled
Henry
Irving
that
worst
of
great
actors
with
undeserved
praise
But
if
actresses
came
from
the
continent
such
as
Bernhardt
Duse
Rejane
Segond
Weber
Mr
Winter
poured
a
volley
of
abuse
into
them
riddling
their
private
life
ridiculing
their
art
alto
gether
behaving
like
a
hen-minded
and
highly
moral
man
His
unfairness
has
had
no
equal
before
or
since
notwithstanding
his
vast
knowledge
and
experience
Foreign
strumpets
was
no
unusual
expression
to
be
found
in
his
reviews
He
notoriously
overpraised
Ada
Rehan
who
couldn
t
hold
a
candle
to
Helena
Modjeska
not
that
he
was
unfair
to
that
subtle
and
charming
Polish
actress
but
that
Augustin
Daly
and
Miss
Rehan
had
won
his
critical
suffrage
He
used
to
be
called
the
House
Poet
of
Daly
s
not
without
warrant
One
morning
he
published
a
nasty
attack
on
Maurice
Barrymore
not
because
of
his
acting
but
his
morals
Maurice
who
lived
a
Bohemian
life
didn
t
see
what
his
doing
off
the
boards
had
to
do
with
his
artistic
capacity
I
was
with
him
at
the
Arena
when
he
wrote
the
following
brief
letter
to
Mr
Winter
Sir
in
your
column
of
The
Tribune
this
morning
you
allude
to
me
as
an
immoral
actor
who
should
not
be
allowed
to
blister
the
gaze
of
the
theatre-going
public
Sir
I
never
kissed
your
daugh
ter
Maurice
Barrymore
I
was
aghast
But
Her
bie
I
remonstrated
people
don
t
write
such
letters
He
gave
me
one
of
his
swift
dagger
glances
and
coolly
rejoined
But
they
do
Honey
they
not
only
write
them
but
they
mail
them
and
he
did
mail
the
letter
and
then
turning
to
me
he
winked
Of
course
you
know
the
old
hedgehog
has
no
daughter
But
he
had
I
shouldn
t
have
written
it
if
he
had
one
This
was
characteristic
of
Barrymore
Another
of
his
bon-mots
was
made
to
me
early
one
morning
as
we
went
up
the
steps
of
the
Lambs
Club
then
on
Thirty-fifth
Street
opposite
the
Garrick
formerly
Harrigan
and
Hart
s
Theatre
We
had
been
on
the
loose
since
the
afternoon
before
though
not
off
the
list
of
the
living
by
a
long
shot
Barrymore
had
conceived
the
queer
notion
that
a
glass
dog
was
fol
lowing
him
and
being
of
a
fanciful
turn
he
speedily
found
a
glass
chain
for
the
fragile
animal
At
Moulds
down
on
University
Place
he
explained
the
invisibility
of
the
dog
by
the
fact
that
light
passed
through
it
and
cast
no
shadow
He
fought
one
unfortunate
man
to
a
finish
Barry
was
a
fighter
of
science
he
had
been
suc
cessful
in
the
prize-ring
and
when
he
grabbed
the
doubter
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
he
led
him
to
the
bar
and
bade
him
drink
adding
Now
next
time
you
ll
know
a
glass
dog
when
you
see
one
The
man
assented
Well
we
led
the
mythical
canine
to
the
Lambs
and
there
it
occurred
to
me
that
dramatic
critics
were
not
admitted
within
its
sacred
enclosure
Oh
come
in
come
in
you
are
not
a
dramatic
critic
said
Maurice
The
witticism
is
ancient
but
the
instance
was
modern
I
went
in
the
glass
dog
tinkling
after
us
on
crystal
paws
and
as
ve
found
Victor
Herbert
and
Victor
Harris
we
didn
t
go
home
till
breakfast
Dear
old
Barry
What
an
Apollo
he
was
Rather
slack
in
his
acting
a
careless
study
he
seemed
the
ideal
Orlando
and
Benedick
I
say
seemed
because
he
was
not
Charles
Coghlan
was
his
superior
at
every
point
save
virile
beauty
and
personal
fascination
though
Coghlan
had
enough
of
both
Alan
Dale
is
still
amusing
us
with
his
criticisms
in
which
always
lurk
kernels
of
truth
despite
his
flippant
manner
Nym
Crinkle
was
more
brilliant
than
safe
and
after
forty
years
I
still
find
myself
reading
Mr
Towse
in
The
Evening
Post
and
agreeing
with
him
Sane
and
scholarly
he
did
not
yield
to
the
Ibsen
or
Shaw
movement
but
to
his
book
Sixty
Years
in
the
Theatre
I
turn
when
I
wish
to
learn
something
of
an
actor
or
actress
their
act
ing
their
personalities
and
not
to
Winter
s
more
polished
literary
performances
Mr
Towse
is
the
sounder
critic
of
the
two
We
often
wondered
how
Mr
Winter
con
trived
to
turn
out
such
a
prodigious
amount
of
copy
in
his
morning
columns
He
would
usually
stay
to
the
end
of
the
play
then
go
to
the
Tribune
Building
and
down-stairs
in
the
public
office
would
write
standing
at
a
desk
then
he
would
go
to
his
home
on
Staten
Island
And
for
fifty
years
or
more
It
was
puzzling
till
some
one
saw
him
working
on
his
voluminous
essays
and
the
mystery
was
partly
explained
So
varied
had
been
his
experience
such
a
trained
journalist
was
he
that
he
could
write
several
thousand
words
about
a
play
before
the
performance
especially
Shakespeare
s
leaving
spaces
for
interlineations
chiefly
dealing
with
the
acting
In
the
case
of
Daly
s
productions
he
attended
rehearsals
and
had
leisure
to
file
his
Augustan
prose
A
perilous
example
for
a
lesser
talent
But
what
classics
he
wrote
When
he
and
Henry
Krehbiel
during
the
early
Wagner
seasons
and
Royal
Cortissoz
were
together
on
The
Trib
une
the
combination
was
difficult
to
beat
In
fact
it
wasn
t
beaten
Mr
Cortissoz
was
literary
editor
in
those
days
and
art
writer
too
He
is
a
ripe
scholar
and
master
of
coloured
prose
I
plodded
I
did
much
reading
in
the
Elizabethans
but
I
saw
I
could
never
hope
to
meet
such
a
master
as
William
Winter
on
equal
terms
besides
I
was
interested
in
the
moderns
Ibsen
Maeterlinck
Hauptmann
Suder
mann
Schnitzler
Strindberg
all
the
new
Paris
crowd
Henri
Becque
first
and
also
the
nascent
dramatic
movement
in
England
For
D
Annunzio
I
had
a
hearty
admiration
though
his
poetic
drama
is
not
for
this
epoch
in
the
theatre
where
vulgarity
and
frivolity
rule
But
as
interpreted
by
that
rarest
of
all
contemporary
act
resses
Eleanora
Duse
the
works
of
the
Italian
are
an
aesthetic
joy
Not
only
is
D
Annunzio
the
greatest
liv
ing
poet
but
as
prose-master
he
has
matched
the
rhyth
mic
and
numerous
prose
of
Ruskin
Swinburne
and
Pater
His
eroticism
barred
all
hope
of
fair
critical
judgment
here
and
in
England
which
is
piddling
hypoc
risy
But
his
themes
aesthetic
and
ever
poetic
would
have
prevented
him
from
the
glaring
badge
of
popular
ity
The
most
virile
poet
of
Italy
since
Carducci
Ga
briele
D
Annunzio
is
uncrowned
poet-laureate
but
crowned
by
the
love
and
admiration
of
his
fellow
countrymen
as
patriot-poet
His
most
significant
novel
is
not
translated
It
deals
with
aviation
It
is
magnifi
cent
and
is
entitled
Forse
che
Si
Fors
che
No
Perhaps
Yes
Perhaps
No
How
I
did
rave
over
Duse
when
she
called
for
reticence
in
criticism
the
golden
reticence
of
her
mysterious
and
moving
art
With
Duse
her
first
season
was
a
remarkable
actor
Flavio
Ando
The
first
play
I
saw
in
New
York
coincided
with
my
first
visit
to
the
city
May
1877
With
my
brother
John
I
went
to
Wallack
s
Theatre
then
at
Broadway
and
Thirteenth
Street
and
enjoyed
Lester
Wallack
in
My
Awful
Dad
not
a
prime
work
of
dramatic
art
but
amusing
Wallack
was
in
his
prime
Later
I
saw
him
in
his
repertory
Rosedale
among
the
rest
But
I
admired
Charles
Coghlan
the
more
In
Diplomacy
with
his
sister
Rose
Coghlan
you
couldn
t
get
anything
better
John
Brougham
John
Gilbert
and
Madame
Ponisi
had
seen
their
best
days
Edwin
Booth
enthralled
me
Lawrence
Barrett
and
John
McCuIIough
did
not
William
Thompson
was
beginning
his
versatile
career
and
Irving
and
Terry
were
considered
the
wonders
of
the
world
The
first
night
at
Philadelphia
of
the
English
actors
I
was
with
my
father
After
Hamlet
s
entrance
my
father
nudged
me
As
cold
as
Macready
without
the
elocution
which
simply
meant
that
like
Macready
Henry
Irving
was
cerebral
as
for
his
speech
and
gait
they
were
distracting
to
ear
and
eye
It
was
a
pity
that
Richard
Mansfield
went
to
London
at
a
time
when
his
style
was
unformed
He
never
outlived
the
mannerisms
he
borrowed
from
Irving
a
deadly
example
for
him
Mansfield
was
a
dynamic
actor
His
German
blood
and
breeding
his
cosmopolitan
culture
made
him
totally
un
American
in
his
methods
He
was
born
on
the
island
of
Heligoland
when
it
was
British
His
mother
Madame
Rudensdorff
I
knew
when
she
lived
at
the
Belvidere
House
and
smashed
the
furniture
in
her
periodical
rages
She
had
been
a
Wagner
singer
in
her
day
From
her
Dick
inherited
his
irritable
temper
his
megalomania
and
from
her
he
acquired
his
skill
in
music
His
father
Gossip
gave
him
several
Jordan
in
Boston
Mansfeldt
and
Signor
Randegger
a
fashionable
singing-master
in
London
I
saw
Randegger
in
the
Co
vent
Garden
Opera
House
one
afternoon
in
1901
when
Hans
Richter
conduct
ed
The
Ring
I
asked
my
friend
Who
does
that
old
gentleman
with
the
bald
head
with
his
back
to
the
orches
tra
look
like
The
answer
promptly
came
Like
Rich
ard
Mansfield
s
father
The
resemblance
was
startling
but
who
shall
say
With
such
artistic
parents
he
was
doomed
to
be
either
an
actor
or
a
singer
he
was
both
He
could
sing
Schubert
Schumann
Brahms
with
finish
Max
Heinrich
had
coached
him
His
speaking
voice
was
resonant
and
varied
Irving
never
had
such
range
of
vo
cal
dynamics
apart
from
the
fact
that
he
was
born
with
an
indifferent
organ
Richard
Mansfield
and
voice
all
the
rest
was
scowling
and
wire-drawn
mimicry
Yet
he
possessed
pathos
and
was
effective
in
a
powerful
cres
cendo
He
reminded
me
of
Friedrich
Haase
without
that
excellent
actor
s
range
Nevertheless
Mansfield
has
not
yet
been
replaced
in
our
theatre
First
heard
in
New
York
in
1897
and
again
in
1904
we
welcomed
the
Hamlet
of
Forbes-Robertson
as
a
revela
tion
Henry
Irving
s
more
intellectual
reading
was
almost
forgotten
and
comparisons
with
Mounet-SuIIy
s
Gallic
fanfaronades
were
out
of
the
question
The
Hamlet
of
Salvini
had
been
magnificent
only
it
wasn
t
the
Prince
Willard
was
too
phlegmatic
Beerbohm
Tree
too
fantastic
and
E
H
Sothern
too
staccato
Edwin
Booth
s
Hamlet
alone
outranked
Robertson
s
finished
as
was
the
art
of
Rossi
his
interpretation
was
Italianate
not
of
the
North
However
for
the
younger
generation
which
knew
not
Booth
except
as
a
ghost
of
himself
surrounded
by
a
third-rate
company
shabby
scenery
and
costume
the
performances
of
Mr
Robert
son
proved
to
be
in
the
nature
of
a
charm
He
was
a
gentle
Danish
Prince
never
truculent
seldom
militant
The
swiftness
and
wholly
modern
quality
did
not
conceal
the
inexorable
fact
that
no
man
has
ever
played
in
its
entirety
the
Prince
that
Shakespeare
drew
that
an
ex
perienced
artist
knowing
this
is
forced
to
compro
mise
that
in
the
case
of
Robertson
temperamen
tal
bias
led
him
into
the
only
path
for
himself
Of
the
melancholic
type
in
facial
expression
sensitive
a
scholarly
amiable
man
perhaps
by
nature
somewhat
of
a
pessimist
he
was
above
all
an
actor
endowed
with
imagination
These
qualities
pressed
into
service
by
a
loving
devotion
to
his
art
and
an
exalted
sincerity
of
purpose
lifted
his
work
to
a
high
plane
He
had
at
his
command
a
supple
mechanism
And
he
was
first
the
elocutionist
then
the
actor
Never
electrifying
his
audi
tors
he
managed
his
transitional
passages
smoothly
without
robbing
them
of
variety
or
emphasis
He
modu
lated
his
effects
without
abruptness
or
violence
Sweetly
morose
ever
luminous
and
in
style
largely
moulded
never
staccato
nor
colloquial
most
musical
most
melancholy
and
of
rare
personal
distinction
the
Hamlet
of
Forbes
Robertson
was
the
most
appealing
since
the
day
of
Booth
Mr
Robertson
was
not
the
mad
Prince
not
the
histrionic
maniac
nor
the
pathologic
case
fit
for
the
psychiatrist
s
clinic
which
some
players
have
made
Hamlet
He
was
sane
so
exquisitely
sane
that
while
the
rude
buffets
of
a
cruel
and
swirling
fortune
at
times
shook
his
spiritual
nature
to
its
centre
yet
they
never
quite
toppled
it
over
This
Hamlet
knew
a
hawk
from
a
hernshaw
I
may
add
that
there
is
much
nonsense
in
the
statement
that
Ham
let
can
not
be
altogether
badly
acted
that
it
is
self-play
ing
when
in
reality
it
is
the
most
abused
character
in
the
Shakespearean
gallery
As
for
Kipling
s
sentimental
The
Light
That
Failed
while
Mr
Robertson
exhibited
technical
skill
and
tender
emotion
the
role
was
beneath
his
powers
Yet
in
that
and
the
sloppy
Jerome
play
he
made
fame
and
fortune
I
have
mentioned
Kipling
I
came
up
from
Paris
to
Rouen
one
morning
with
him
I
was
about
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
tomb
of
Saint
Flaubert
When
I
alighted
Mr
and
Mrs
Kipling
had
taken
their
seats
in
the
dining
car
for
the
midday
dejeuner
The
window
was
open
so
I
said
Mr
Kipling
you
should
have
stopped
at
Rouen
and
made
a
propitiatory
pilgrimage
to
the
tomb
of
Flaubert
in
the
Monumental
Cemetery
if
for
nothing
else
but
to
expiate
your
literary
sins
Mrs
Kipling
smiled
her
brother
Wolcott
Balestier
was
an
old
friend
of
mine
when
he
was
on
The
Sun
but
Rudyard
of
the
Clan
Kipling
preserved
a
stony
mask
The
train
moved
No
doubt
he
took
me
for
a
harmless
lunatic
and
perhaps
he
was
right
I
tried
to
stir
his
artistic
conscience
and
I
knew
of
nothing
more
efficacious
than
a
humble
prayer
pronounced
before
the
Flaubert
commemoration
tablet
in
the
Pare
Solferino
or
at
the
grave
of
the
Holy
Gustave
A
trip
down
the
Seine
to
Croisset
where
is
the
Flaubert
Museum
would
give
the
finishing
touch
In
The
Pathos
of
Distance
I
made
a
little
study
of
the
Violas
I
had
seen
beginning
with
Adelaide
Neilson
in
Theatre
Miss
Neilson
was
supported
by
Eben
Plympton
the
Sebastian
Walcot
Malvolio
McDonough
Sir
Toby
Howard
Sir
Andrew
Hemple
the
Clown
Miss
Barbour
the
Maria
At
the
Fifth
Avenue
Theatre
Mr
Daly
revived
Twelfth
Night
in
1877
with
Miss
Neilson
as
Viola
Charles
Fisher
Malvolio
Barton
Hill
George
Clarke
Harry
Dixey
have
played
Malvolio
and
can
we
forget
Irving
Charles
Walcot
was
my
first
Malvolio
The
Violas
were
Mrs
Scott-Siddons
Ellen
Terry
Fanny
Davenport
Ada
Rehan
Marie
Wainwright
Helena
Modjeska
most
poetic
after
Neilson
s
Viola
Allen
and
Julia
Marlowe
In
her
early
days
Mrs
John
Drew
played
Viola
It
was
at
a
reading
that
I
heard
Mrs
Scott-Siddon
s
Viola
She
was
beautiful
to
gaze
upon
Miss
Marlowe
was
charming
and
Miss
Matthison
a
Viola
in
the
mode
minor
Her
voice
was
noble
though
not
so
caressing
as
the
organ
of
rare
Julia
Marlowe
Ah
the
pathos
of
distance
Through
the
avenue
of
my
memory
there
silently
passes
a
throng
of
names
The
members
of
the
Union
Square
Stock
Company
of
Wallack
s
of
the
Madison
Square
during
the
auspicious
reign
of
Daniel
Frohman
of
Daly
s
of
the
Empire
I
suppose
the
complaint
of
grumbling
after
forty
is
chronic
with
critics
The
palmy
days
we
sigh
and
some
day
the
present
generation
will
do
the
same
Ah
those
were
the
palmy
days
of
George
Cohan
Sam
Bernard
and
Louis
Mann
When
the
Har
rigan
and
Hart
company
dissolved
we
thought
no
one
could
replace
Annie
Yeamans
or
Johnny
Wild
and
no
one
has
The
Charles
Hoyt
regime
set
in
and
it
was
amusing
enough
after
a
lapse
George
Cohan
appeared
on
the
scene
and
seizing
the
Time-Spirit
by
the
horns
brought
the
beast
to
its
knees
There
is
a
divining
sense
given
to
a
few
lucky
mortals
and
clever
George
possesses
it
The
hour
was
ripe
for
vulgarity
and
as
there
is
noth
ing
so
catching

On
West
Twenty-fifth
Street
there
was
a
French
boarding-house
kept
by
a
couple
M
and
Madame
Felix
The
guests
were
mainly
theatrical
folk
with
a
sprinkling
of
musicians
and
writers
The
table
was
good
the
wines
cheap
and
always
was
there
a
little
poker
game
in
the
private
apartment
of
M
Felix
I
lived
there
for
years
It
was
in
the
heart
of
theatre-land
and
thus
I
made
the
acquaintance
of
David
Belasco
who
with
his
lovable
family
occupied
a
suite
on
the
same
floor
as
I
I
verily
believe
that
Balzac
would
have
wished
for
noth
ing
better
to
describe
than
the
Maison
Felix
The
com
pany
was
lively
there
were
pretty
women
jolly
men
Occasionally
but
not
too
often
or
too
openly
a
basket
containing
letters
would
be
let
down
from
an
upper
story
on
a
string
There
were
few
ructions
nevertheless
the
atmosphere
was
worthy
of
De
Maupassant
I
got
into
the
habit
of
taking
midnight
walks
with
David
Belasco
He
was
stage
producer
then
for
the
Frohmans
and
I
was
writing
about
the
theatre
D
B
as
we
called
him
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
stage
As
he
drank
his
milk
he
would
urge
me
to
play-making
but
I
hadn
t
the
vocation
and
heeded
him
not
Have
I
written
poetry
Yes

Have
I
written

Yes
Locked
in

was

A
funny
affair
at
the
Maison
Felix
was
a
farewell
dinner
given
by
his
friends
to
a
singer
about
to
launch
himself
into
the
perilous
sea
of
matrimony
with
a
celebrated
singing
actress
With
the
exception
of
myself
probably
every
man
Jack
at
the
table
had
been
on
friendly
terms
with
the
bride
Speeches
were
made
Toasts
were
drunk
The
bridegroom
was
overwhelmed
by
emotion
Did
he
guess
the
truth
I
never
made
after-dinner
speeches
but
urged
by
strong
hands
I
got
on
my
legs
and
began

might
say

It

only

I
was
so
im
pressed
by
the
evening
that
I
wrote
a
prose-poem
about
it
It
makes
me
think
of
the
two
young
women
in
Paris
who
found
themselves
at
a
monkey
cage
in
the
Zoo
They
were
experienced
members
of
a
very
ancient
profession
and
as
the
agile
and
grotesque
animals
were
playing
all
sorts
of
silly
tricks
one
girl
said
to
the
other
Give
them
clothes
with
money
in
their
pockets
and
they
would
be
real
men
Did
I
ever
tell
you
the
witticism
of
Maurice
Barrymore
concerning
a
fiasco
made
by
a
foreign-born
actress
of
a
certain
reputation
at
the
Man
hattan
Opera
House
Barry
supported
the
lady
whose
voice
was
not
powerful
enough
for
the
big
auditorium
I
asked
him
how
she
succeeded
I
was
at
another
theatre
Obscene
but
not
heard
he
answered
I
have
told
you
that
I
knew
Willie
Wilde
Oscar
s
brother
He
was
a
companionable
pagan
Every
ten
minutes
he
would
light
a
fresh
cigarette
every
fifteen
ask
for
another
drink
He
invariably
preluded

saw
much
of

Weimar

and

I
wrote
about
Nietzsche
as
early
as
1888
and
Ibsen
still
earlier
yet
I
was
not
an
Ibsenite
The
two
Ibsen
pioneers
here
were
Professor
H

Boyesen
of
Columbia
Univer
sity
and
William
Morton
Payne
then
editor
of

Mr
Payne
translated
and
finished
Jaeger
s
Life
of
Ibsen
In
England
Edmund
Gosse
and
William
Archer
were
the
sponsors
of
Ibsen
But
I
fought
in
the
critical
trenches
for
the
new
art
from
the
Land
of
the
Midnight
Whiskers
And
it
was
a
hard
battle
as
the
entire
press
was
dead
against
him
We
took
our
the
atrical
fashions
from
England
and

An
honourable
exception

years

that
the

It
was
unfortunate
for
Henrik

that

discovered
him
In
this
misfortune
he
keeps
company
with
Browning
and
Meredith
There
are
dark
places
in
the

of
every

these
obscurities
should
not

illuminations
Long
ago
Daddy
Ibsen
s
plays
were
seized
by
the
propagandists
at
first
by
the
socialists
then
the
individualists
then
by
the
women
in
search
of
a
message
Now
the
women
have
cooled
off
a
little
in
their
devotion
Ibsen
at
a
banquet
in
Christiania
told
the
ladies
present
that
their
place
was
in
the
home
Shades
of
Nora
Helmer
He
said
that
he
was
primarily
interested
in
them
as
human
beings
not
in
their
sex
or
their
wrongs
But
the
mystery-mongers
found
him
too
tempting
a
subject
for
their
busy
exegetical
pens
hence
the
huge
and
absolutely
useless
literature
that
has
accumulated
dealing
with
the
meanings
of
his
works
when
his
chief
significance
is
as
a
creator
of
characters
and
in
his
dramatic
construction
Techni
cally
he
stems
from
France
the
influences
of
Scribe
and
Dumas
fils
are
not
to
be
denied
But
the
unhappy
man
fell
into
the
clutches
of
the
college
professor
and
exegesis
slew
him
To-day
he
is
played
with
the
vivacity
of
an
undertaker
at
a
preacher
s
funeral
Every
phrase
is
packed
with
esoteric
meaning
and
the
itching
to
dis
cover
strange
symbols
in
his
dialogue
causes
an
atmos
phere
of
gloom
and
apathy
instead
of
a
brisk
tempo
the
players
utter
their
lines
as
if
the
earth
was
on
the
edge
of
dissolution
Ibsen
s
dialogue
is
natural
or
noth
ing
He
is
a
reader
of
the
human
heart
And
when
he
is
in
the
roster
of
all
stock
companies
as
he
is
on
the
continent
then
he
may
be
appreciated
But
I
doubt
it
He
makes
you
think
as
well
as
feel
Not
with
impunity
can
genius
benefit

slyly
remarked

PICTURES
After
writing
about
art
on
The
Sun
for
a
year
I
made
pilgrimages
to
the
principal
art
shrines
of
Europe
I
had
a
brief
passion
for
the
gorgeous
canvases
of
Monti
celli
and
while
it
would
be
impossible
to
see
them
all
he
painted
one
a
day
for
his
absinthe
I
saw
the
best
I
went
to
the
south
of
France
as
far
as
Marseilles
and
discovered
some
notable
pictures
Then
a
reaction
I
fancy
I
fell
in
love
for
the
hundredth
time
with
Ver
meer
I
actually
saw
thirty
of
his
thirty-three
or
four
masterpieces
missing
only
one
important
example
somewhere
in
Scotland
a
Christ
composition
The
Rembrandts
are
not
easily
traced
but
when
I
got
as
far
as
the
Hermitage
self-portrait
at
Petrograd
I
called
a
halt
In
New

I
wrote
much
of
the
so-called

Alden
Weir
Arthur
B
Davies
is
to
my
way
of
thinking
the
most
individual
artist
we
have
to-day
in
this
country
He
has
vision
and
is
a
master
of
his
material
When
Alfred
Stieglitz
opened
his
little
Photo-Secession
Gallery
at
291
Fifth
Avenue
he
practically
inaugurated
a
new
movement
in
art
The
exhibitions
of
Independents
that
I
had
been
visiting
at
Paris
for
ten
years
were
suddenly
transplanted
to
New
York
We
were
shown
Matisse
Picasso
Picabia
Bran
cusi
Cezanne
Gauguin
Van

Their
artistic
im
pact
on
the
younger
generation
was
marked
We
had
John
Marin
Rockwell
Kent
Samuel
Halpert
Marsden
Hartley
Weber
Jo
Davidson
and
Walkowitz
Robert
Henri
held
aloof
from
the
movement
he
was
self-con
tained
and
influenced
more
by
Goya
The

Albert
P
Ryder
has

lives
Not
to
go
back
to
the

there
was
a
time
when
Bouguereau
occupied

in
New

and
his
worshippers
went
to
the

bar
to
stare
at

too
and
after

Barbizons
Manet
Renoir
also
Bastien-Lepage
Even
in
New
York
as
late
as
1906
I
found
to
my
amazement
that
Manet
was
con
sidered
terribly
audacious
that
he
was
neither
an
expert
draughtsman
nor
a
colourist
Stupendous
And
then

crazy
clowns
Futurists
Neo-Impres
sionists

swelling
host

ocrities
Paul
Cezanne
had
intervened
He
became
the
rage
Spry
collectors
pursued
him
in
the
haunt
of
every
collector
there
is
a
bargain
counter
Dealers
yearned
for
him
Elderly
painters
execrated
his
name
Guileless
folk
pronounced
him
Suzanne
and
secretly
wondered
why
he
is
so
ugly
And
though
not
the
greatest
painter
of
all
nevertheless
his
was
a
philosophic
temperament
The
chiefest
misconception
of
Cezanne
is
that
of
the
theoretical
fanatics
who
not
only
proclaim
him
chef
d
ecole
which
he
is
but
also
declare
him
to
be
the
greatest
painter
that
wielded
a
brush
since

tines

would
have
been
astounded
if
he
had
known
that
he
would
be
saluted
by
such
uncritical
rhap
sodies
If
ever
an
axiom
is
contradicted
in
practice
it
is
that
there
is
no
disputing
tastes
As
if
we
don
t
spend
part
of
our
existence
battling
with
other
people
s
preju
dices
Note
also
that
the
other
fellow
is
always
prej
udiced
in
favour
of
his
own
opinions
usually
considered
by
us
as
stupid
or
narrow
Our
judgments
are
well
nigh
infallible
and
our
special
mission
is
to
set
our
neigh
bour
right
This
conflict
is
perpetual
It
makes
life
bearable
In
matters
of
art
I
find
the
same
intolerance
Because
I
like
Henri
Matisse
I
am
told
that
I
suffer
from
optical
degeneration
The
same
was
said
of
me
when
I
admired
Manet
Monet
Degas
Matisse
has
confessed
I
condense
the
signification
of
the
body
by
looking
for
the
essential
lines
which
is
slightly
different
from
the
cockney
Cubists
and
their
chatter
about
sig
nificant
form
Mr
Berenson
has
pronounced
Matisse
to
be
a
magnificent
draughtsman
and
a
great
designer
The
Chinese
are
his
masters
also
the
masters
of
the
world
in
art
though
we
are
only
beginning
to
find
it
out
Japan
which
originates
nothing
borrowed
its
art
from
the
older
kingdom
I
don
t
care
whether
Matisse
is
a
Poster-Impressionist
a
sensitivist
expressivist
or
a
snark
but
I
do
know
that
he
is
a
master
of
line
that
as
Frank
Mather
Jr
asserts
has
had
no
superior
since
the
time
of
PoIIajuolo
and
the
Florentines
What
if
the
concu
binage
of
his
colours
screams
in
rhythms
that
make
the
flesh
creep
There
is
power
profound
sophistication
subtle
rhythm
all
couched
in
novel
terms
He
can
be
suavely
harmonious
He
is
sometimes
as
sunny
and
simple
as
Mozart
or
Monet
Since
the
death
of
Ce
zanne
Gauguin
and
Van
Gogh
Matisse
is
the
master
of
the
field
But
Cezanne
is
the
enthroned
pontiff
of
the
modern
pantheon
It
was
at
Saratoga
I
met
a
man
who
called
himself
a
common
gambler
In
reality
he
was
uncommon
Sel
dom
was
one
in
his
profession
as
cultivated
A
pagan
he
was
refreshing
in
his
freedom
from
hypoc
risy
Clerical
in
appearance
so
clerical
that
James
Whistler
who
painted
his
portrait
and
the
artist
he
most
admired
and
cherished
among
the
moderns
had
nicknamed
him
His
Reverence
The
portrait
bore
that
title
when
exhibited
He
had
no
illusion
as
to
his
social
position
nor
was
he
a
snob
among
sports
When
he
alluded
to
his
calling
he
was
neither
shrinking
nor
vainglorious
He
maintained
that
his
was
the
next
old
est
of
professions
Place
aux
dames
He
asserted
that
a
man
had
a
run
for
his
money
when
he
gambled
at
least
he
could
see
his
cash
planked
down
on
the
green
see
it
swallowed
by
the
turn
of
the
wheel
or
rapt
away
by
an
unlucky
card
whereas
on
the
Street
you
sel
dom
see
the
colour
of
your
bank-notes
after
they
leave
your
hands
And
continued
my
friend
the
game
on
Wall
Street
is
not
always
as
fair
as
at
Saratoga
New
port
or
Forty-fourth
Street
Yet
this
hardheaded
money-getting
man
was
soft-hearted
at
the
proper
time
In
1906
during
the
palmy
days
of
his
Casino
I
saw
him
send
away
a
young
fool
who
had
whimperingly
confessed
that
the
money
he
had
staked
at
roulette
was
not
his
in
a
word
stolen
The
gambler
said
Here
is
your
money
young
man
return
it
to
the
bank
adding
with
an
ironical
smile
Go
and
sin
no
more
But
when
a
sporting
millionaire
wished
to
play
then
the
wheel
whizzed
its
merriest
A
Robin
Hood
of
the
Green
was
our
gambler
His
love
of
pictures
and
old
furniture
became
a
veritable
passion
His
taste
was
impeccable
his
judgment
seldom
at
fault
His
chief
god
in
art
was
Velasquez
We
always
called
him
The
Spaniard
He
bought
Whistlers
at
a
time
when
it
was
a
courageous
act
I
often
crossed
with
him
to
Europe
and
his
good
graces
introduced
me
to
Whistler
who
was
exceedingly
uncertain
in
likes
and
dislikes
He
liked
the
gambler
and
was
not
rude
to
his
friends
When
the
Whistler
collection
was
shown
at
the
Metropolitan
Museum
we
were
amazed
at
its
quality
yet
he
had
no
illusions
concerning
Butterfly
James
He
will
live
by
his
etch
ings
not
his
pictures
an
opinion
I
had
heard
from
the
mouth
of
William
M
Laffan
an
expert
who
predicted
that
owing
to
his
poisonous
paint
the
canvases
were
doomed
to
blackening
and
desiccation
This
prophecy
is
I
am
sorry
to
say
being
fulfilled
Charitable
and
ac
cording
to
his
lights
honourable
my
gambling
friend
was
a
complex
of
confusing
and
contradictory
traits
A
psy
chologist
would
have
enjoyed
as
I
did
unwinding
the
tan
gled
skein
of
his
character
When
his
wonderful
Whistlers
were
sold
and
with
them
his
prized
Sheraton
furniture
I
studied
them
at
his
Madison
Avenue
home
and
also
at
his
house
across
the
street
from
the
St
Regis
the
art
world
was
aflame
with
curiosity
He
died
of
a
fall
in
the
subway
and
left
more
friends
than
he
knew
His
name
was
need
I
tell
you
Richard
Canfield
While
writing
of
old-time
theatrical
topics
I
forgot
to
relate
a
story
about
Adelaide
Neilson
and
her
man
ager
Frederick
Schwab
There
had
been
some
gossip
when
the
star
went
to
San
Francisco
A
report
of
their
matrimonial
engagement
was
circulated
As
Miss
Neilson
was
not
on
the
best
of
terms
with
Schwab
she
threatened
to
discharge
him
if
he
didn
t
contradict
the
rumour
He
answered
I
don
t
know
who
ought
to
get
most
angry
about
the
gossip
If
you
feel
yourself
disgraced
by
it
what
should
I
feel
Which
was
the
retort
courteous
Miss
Neilson
was
fond
of
Schwab
be
cause
he
was
the
first
man
to
greet
her
on
her
arrival
in
New
York
Years
afterwards
when
he
was
manager
for
Vladimir
de
Pachmann
the
slightly
eccentric
pianist
I
think
in
1890
he
had
a
trying
time
to
keep
the
little
artist
in
order
One
morning
at
Schuberth
s
music
store
on
Union
Square
Fred
Schwab
entered
De
Pachmann
his
right
name
is
Waldemar
Bachmann
without
the
De
who
had
been
playing
rushed
to
his
manager
cry
ing
I
love
you
so
much
I
must
kiss
you
He
kissed
Schwab
on
the
neck
not
a
kiss
of
peace
but
a
bite
so
nasty
indeed
that
the
manager
had
to
wear
a
silk
scarf
to
hide
the
teethmarks
He
did
not
have
de
Pachmann
arrested
for
mayhem
surely
a
Chopinzee
then
but
so
it
was
whispered
made
an
iron-clad
contract
for
the
next
season
by
the
terms
of
which
the
manager
would
not
be
altogether
the
loser
At
the
time
I
remarked
of
de
Pachmann
that
his
Bach
was
worse
than
his
bite
At
a
piano
recital
in
old
Chick
ering
Hall
given
by
his
wife
and
pupil
Margaret
Okey
now
the
widow
of
the
French
advocate
Ferdinand
Labori
counsel
for
Dreyfus
de
Pachmann
after
up
roariously
applauding
her
became
censorious
when
she
finished
a
Henselt
etude
Thanksgiving
after
the
Storm
A
sharp
hiss
was
heard
in
the
auditorium
It
was
from
the
lips
of
her
husband
Oscar
Hammerstein
I
remem
ber
had
hissed
a
performer
in
his
Manhattan
Opera
House
but
for
a
husband
to
hiss
his
wife
in
public
we

NEW

IN
FICTION
Anyone
with
good
red
blood
in

has
made
in

fascinating
pilgrimages
to
the
fic
titious
abodes
of
Dickens
and
Thackeray
Balzac
Zola
and
De
Maupassant

become
an
object
of
veneration

New

noisy
dirty
politics-ridden
her
mighty
flanks
gashed
by
greed
is
daily
reborn
in
the
imagination
of
her
admirers
Walt
Whitman
sang
her
praises
Charles
Dickens
registered
her
defects
But
there
she
stands
Take
her
or
leave
her
it
is
all
the
same
to
our
Lady
of
Towers
Love
her
as
did
O
Henry
and
from
that
love
something
is
bound
to
result
Magic
mud
moonlight
money
misery
and
multitudes
may
be
discovered
as
befits
the
temperament
of
each
wooer
of
her
favours
Such
men
as
Poe
and
Sydney
Porter
O
Henry
found
her
a
stony-hearted
stepmother
yet
contrived
to
weave
from
their
defeats
magical
carpets
that
transport
their
readers
on
the
wings
of
fancy
When
the
town
was
young
Washington
Ir
ving
Cooper
Poe
and
their
contemporaries
recall
to
us
Battery

Bowling

There
is
the
later
Wall
Street
of
Edwin
Lefevre
Frank
Norris

visited
by
Robert

Barr
McCutcheon
Rex

Owen

Samuel

It
is
the
most
alluring
lane
in
the
world
Many
writers
who
enter
it
emerge
without
spoils
literary
or
otherwise
yet
not
shorn
of
their
desire
for
it
More
than
one

has
succumbed
to
its
golden
glamour

the
canvases
of

Cooper
How
much
fiction
there
exists
in
which
the
young
protagonist
views
the
frowning
battlements
of
the
city
from
the
decks
of
an
incoming
ferry-boat
He
may
not
shake
his
fist
at
the
Woolworth
tower
as
did
Rastignac
Balzac
s
sorry
hero
when
watching
Paris
from
the
heights
and
melodramatically
muttering
The
fight
s
between
us
two
now
But
some
spirit
of
antagonism
blended
with
ambition
must
fill
the
bosom
of
adventuring
youth
as
he
beholds
what
may
be
the
home
of
realised
hopes
that
is
unless
he
comes
by
way
of
the
Hudson
Tubes
and
then
the
old
ferry-boat
is
no
longer
a
stage
set
for
his
noble
gesture

A
VOCAL
ABELARD
I
had
always
liked
the
old
man
I
met
him
first
at
a
dingy
little
table
d
hote
just
off
Fourteenth
Street
a
quiet
retired
place
where
the
spaghetti
smoked
the
wine
was
cheap
and
not
too
nasty
and
the
tariff
very
low
Understand
me
I
didn
t
spend
much
money
on
food
preferring
to
invest
it
in
books
books
easy
to
procure
if
one
only
has
the
price
I
care
little
for
black-letter
editions
I
would
even
allow
an
Aldus
or
an
Elzevir
to
pass
me
if
a
copy
of
Flaubert
s
Temptation
were
nigh
or
the
music
of
Mallarme
s
poetry
available
I
actually
did
give
my
watch
to
one
of
those
gentlemen
who
lend
money
at
high
per
cent
on
account
of
a
first
edition
Ah
but
what
a
copy
With
illustrations
by
Manet
But
I
m
forgetting
about
Agnani
Ettore
Agnani
to
give
him
his
full
name
was
one
of
those
operatic
waifs
cast
up
by
the
ocean
of
music
and
stranded
in
the
city
with
only
the
shreds
and
shards
of
a
bass
voice
He
was
a
musty-skinned
high-nosed
Italian
with
some
evi
dences
of
gentility
still
hovering
about
his
person
a
lover
of
Italian
sauces
and
an
inveterate
raconteur
In
those
days
the
table
d
hote
was
a
hobby
of
mine
I
have
discovered
many
good
places
and
remained
with
them
till
their
inevitable
decadence
and
would
then
begin
my
search
anew
I
have
eaten
at
an
Irish
table
d
hote
where
Saucissons
Patrique
were
served
and
at
Rumanian
restaurants
where
pepper
reigned
and
beef
was
a
side
issue
Finally
I
discovered
Varsi
s
and
was
i8o
STEEPLEJACK
satisfied
Soup
that
savoured
of
cockroaches
was
hardly
to
be
commended
but
the
spaghetti
For
forty
cents
I
dined
royally
drank
Chianti
from
Hoboken
Heights
and
waxed
fat
and
lusty
Chance
one
evening
brought
Agnani
to
my
table
and
the
aristocratic
deliberation
with
which
he
placed
his
eye-glasses
on
the
bridge
of
his
skinny
nose
as
he
scanned
the
menu
pleased
me
His
hands
were
lean
brown
withered
and
he
sported
one
ring
a
blood-stone
as
antique
as
its
owner
Agnani
was
a
character
We
became
friends
for
while
I
am
not
much
of
a
lover
of
music
I
like
its
literary
side
I
am
enamoured
of
gossip
memoirs
recollections
which
concern
distinguished
people
and
otherwise
and
Ag
nani
as
he
ate
his
fritto
would
ramble
through
the
mists
of
his
past
and
occasionally
dig
up
something
of
inter
est
How
the
old
rascal
laughed
as
he
slashed
a
woman
s
reputation
and
with
what
zest
he
recounted
his
early
operatic
triumphs
He
had
a
little
dog
to
which
he
was
devoted
I
simply
loathed
it
It
was
one
of
those
shrewish
rat-terriers
not
big
enough
to
make
a
meal
for
an
honest
Newfoundland
and
it
always
bared
its
tiny
gums
at
me
in
the
most
malignant
manner
Agnani
was
crazy
over
the
beast
and
I
ll
never
forget
the
night
when
in
a
stifled
voice
he
said
Nina
is
dead
Nina
was
the
name
of
the
little
animal
and
I
hadn
t
the
heartlessness
to
let
him
know
how
glad
I
felt
at
the
news
Agnani
seemed
the
most
frank
of
men
till
his
private
life
was
touched
upon
and
then
his
soul
flew
behind
bars
and
bolts
and
he
would
become
unapproachable
I
am
not
too
curious
but
I
have
an
aching
nerve
called
by
the
psychiatrists
a
craving
for
psychical
insight
To
believe
that
this
brain-barren
Lombard
had
soul
states
would
be
rather
ridiculous
for
his
greatest
con
cern
in
life
had
seemed
the
tomato
sauce
on
his
spaghetti
and
Nina
After
the
little
dog
died
he
would
work
him
self
up
into
a
green
rage
with
Pietro
the
one-eyed
garcon
when
the
sauce
was
scorched
Otherwise
an
acid
smile
lurked
under
his
dyed
and
gummed
mustachios
and
his
laugh
was
crackling
He
wore
a
red
necktie
and
I
have
heard
that
he
had
achieved
his
greatest
artistic
success
as
a
buffo-basso
He
baffled
me
did
this
broken
down
singer
to
whom
I
frequently
extended
dinner
in
vitations
with
the
hope
of
getting
a
story
a
rich
live
story
which
would
repay
me
for
my
trouble
This
may
sound
cruel
but
I
am
a
newspaper
man
and
ink
not
blood
circulates
in
my
veins
I
took
Agnani
to
a
Chinese
table
d
hote
and
fed
him
on
bird
s-nest
soup
and
chop-suey
I
took
him
to
old
Martin
s
where
they
breakfast
like
epicures
I
dined
him
at
the
Maison
Felix
but
even
the
artistic
dinner
in
that
rare
spot
failed
to
warm
the
cockles
on
his
soul
At
last
one
warm
June
night
I
met
him
tottering
up
Third
Avenue
looking
ill
and
dogless
his
scarlet
tie
had
less
of
its
flamboyancy
and
the
man
was
meek
and
dusty
The
hour
must
have
been
ten
and
his
eyes
plainly
im
plored
Give
me
to
drink
I
brought
the
old
chap
to
Scheffel
Hall
and
bade
him
drink
beer
and
to
my
sur
prise
he
drank
it
greedily
Italians
are
not
fanatical
beer
drinkers
They
are
more
given
to
cordials
which
they
sip
after
a
river
of
oily
eloquence
Not
so
Agnani
He
developed
a
colossal
thirst
and
about
the
twelfth
or
thirteenth
glass
light
broke
at
last
He
was
drunk
serenely
so
after
the
manner
of
the
family
Agnani
Then
it
all
came
out
He
was
the
second
son
of
a
Lom
bard
family
whose
name
made
me
blink
when
he
told
it
You
will
never
know
as
I
ll
go
to
the
crematory
with
his
secret
Besides
what
does
a
name
amount
to
except
it
be
at
the
bottom
of
a
certified
cheque
He
must
have
been
a
wild
spendthrift
and
had
bonnes
fortunes
but
of
the
inchoate
mass
of
reminiscences
he
hurled
at
me
I
recall
only
one
story
a
story
so
improbable
that
it
set
me
to
dreaming
of
the
loves
of
Abelard
and
Heloise
and
for
the
moment
transformed
the
faded
features
of
Agnani
into
the
stern
lineaments
of
the
implacable
Canon
Fulbert
Here
is
the
anecdote
The
Milan
Opera
Company
which
had
left
that
capital
to
go
on
tour
in
the
provinces
comprised
as
its
personnel
Rosati

Lahn

Dimali

were

course
but
these
were
the
principals
and
with
the
impresario
Negri
and
the
Conductor
Pinuti
dined
at
the
first
table
and
travelled
second-class
The
rest
of
the
company
went
au
troisieme
The
real
artist
in
the
troupe
Dimali
was
a
tenor
of
the
robust
type
with
a
voice
like
steel
and
a
determined
lover
of
women
The
soprano
and
contralto
were
mediocre
but
hand
some
and
close
friends
I
liked
them
both
said
Agnani
in
a
quavering
voice
because
they
were
good-looking
women
and
I
always
had
a
weakness
for
female
beauty
This
was
so
in
geniously
accented
and
he
looked
such
a
crumbling
ruin
even
as
he
boasted
that
I
ordered
two
more
beers
He
drank
both
by
mistake
I
fancied
Then
he
continued
I
was
never
on
very
good
terms
with
Dimali
He
was
so
conceited
he
was
a
fine
looking
man
no
one
could
gainsay
that
but
he
made
eyes
at
every
petticoat
and
no
chambermaid
was
ugly
enough
to
keep
him
at
bay
that
is
if
there
were
no
prettier
women
around
And
how
that
fellow
could
drink
He
fairly
swilled
always
took
a
treat
and
never
stood
one
Ah
he
was
a
mean
rascal
but
before
the
footlights
he
was
superb
Agnani
rolled
his
eyes
and
lighted
another
cigarette
Its
thin
cool
smoke
curled
above
his
shining
pate
and
straightway
I
forgot
the
clangour
of
Third
Avenue
and
my
fancy
lit
up
the
stage
of
some
shabby
opera-house
in
a
second
or
third
rate
Italian
city
as
on
its
boards
moved
to
tones
the
passionate
puppets
of
transpontine
opera
Dimali
never
knew
when
to
stop
pursued
the
basso
his
ancient
jealousy
of
the
man
favoured
by
women
breaking
forth
when
his
feet
were
treading
one
might
say
the
very
edge
of
his
grave
He
was
aware
of
his
artistic
superiority
and
always
impressed
you
with
it
He
disdained
the
two
women
principals
and
while
en
route
usually
devoted
himself
to
some
pretty
chorus
girls
riding
third-class
and
only
turning
up
at
meal
times
We
sang
with
varying
success
in
many
of
the
smaller
cities
and
in
a
few
of
the
larger
ones
and
our
life
was
one
of
the
customary
cheap
triumphs
cheaper
lodg
ings
and
general
depression
Rosati
and
Lahn
kept
together
the
manager
conductor
and
I
played
our
dom
inos
after
the
performance
The
conductor
Signor
Pinuti
was
the
most
cold-blooded
wretch
I
ever
met
He
had
formerly
been
a
surgeon
in
Ravenna
but
want
of
practice
drove
him
into
the
musical
profession
for
which
he
had
a
marked
talent
He
would
in
his
drawling
tone
recite
damnable
stories
of
surgical
operations
till
I
shivered
my
nerves
were
a
woman
s
and
I
feared
the
sight
of
blood
I
hadn
t
been
much
with
Pinuti
before
I
discovered
that
despite
his
harsh
frigid
nature
he
was
passionately
in
love
with
Rosati
the
big
blonde
soprano
who
apparently
cared
for
no
one
It
was
in
Ravenna
Pinuti
s
native
city
that
I
first
noticed
Di
mali
s
queer
behaviour
with
the
contralto
Lahn
Out
of
bravado
he
began
to
make
love
to
her
desperately
without
shame
and
when
a
man
like
this
tenor
becomes
earnest
he
may
prove
dangerous
He
fairly
haunted
Lahn
and
the
pretty
silly
brunette
showed
she
was
conscious
of
the
handsome
singer
s
wooing
Rosati
sul
lenly
watched
the
game
but
was
she
indifferent
Our
conductor
had
apparently
ingratiated
himself
into
her
graces
and
they
became
inseparable
Thus
we
split
into
three
camps
for
I
associated
with
the
manager
Negri
We
watched
the
conductor
and
soprano
and
they
in
their
turn
spied
upon
the
contralto
and
tenor
Pinuti
by
this
time
was
crazy
in
love
and
the
once
cold
Rosati
seemed
to
favour
him
Ah
my
boy
how
little
do
we
know
of
women
and
their
tricky
ways
One
morning
after
rehearsal
I
overheard
Pinuti
speaking
with
Dimali
rather
arguing
I
was
in
my
dressing-room
and
every
word
came
to
me
clear
cut
Of
course
I
listened
Let
her
alone
I
beg
I
command
you
cried
the
conductor
Ah
Ah
Am
I
poaching
on
your
property
asked
Dimali
in
his
most
irritating
style
There
was
a
significant
silence
then
Pinuti
said
in
a
hollow
strained
voice
You
insult
Lahn
As
for
me
I
am
betrothed
to
Signorina
Rosati
Perhaps
the
shoe
pinches
there
responded
Dimali
laughing
villainously
Then
I
heard
no
more
Later
I
could
see
that
the
Rosati
had
become
Dimali
s
enemy
Evidently
Pinutf
had
told
her
of
the
tenor
s
nasty
speech
for
she
never
noticed
Dimali
except
when
singing
with
him
Lahn
seemed
conscious
of
a
change
in
the
moral
temperature
and
avoided
her
former
chum
beyond
doubt
she
was
succumbing
to
the
fervour
of
the
tenor
Things
couldn
t
go
on
this
way
much
longer
I
told
Negri
so
He
only
laughed
and
said
I
had
too
much
imagination
at
the
same
time
bidding
me
not
to
mix
up
in
the
affair
Each
day
Pinuti
grew
gloomier
and
when
not
conducting
was
scheming
He
was
constantly
with
Rosati
and
they
watched
the
other
pair
of
lovers
like
detectives
These
were
aware
of
the
espionage
yet
never
acted
as
if
they
wished
to
be
alone
Like
true
Italians
they
made
love
in
public
and
parted
every
night
after
a
public
embrace
that
made
Rosati
wince
and
Pinuti
turn
pale
What
extraordinary
reasons
had
these
people
for
objecting
to
the
love
of
the
tenor
and
contralto
Was
Pinuti
also
in
love
with
the
brunette
Or
perhaps
the
soprano
was
really
in
love
with
the
tenor
and
jealous
of
the
coquettish
Lahn
I
couldn
t
make
it
out
Suddenly
to
my
amazement
happiness
reigned
in
our
little
circle
The
conductor
threw
off
his
dark
mood
and
sparkled
with
jests
and
cheerfulness
Rosati
too
forgot
the
two
lovers
and
peace
once
more
unfolded
her
wings
above
us
What
did
I
tell
you
old
Grandmother
Goose
jocosely
remarked
the
manager
to
me
but
I
held
my
tongue
I
am
a
Lombard
and
the
Lombardians
are
naturally
suspicious
Soon
Pinuti
and
Dimali
became
thick
as
sheep
at
pasture
and
continually
drinking
and
pledging
each
other
in
strong
wine
Dimali
was
a
rois
terer
who
always
drank
too
much
while
Pinuti
the
man
from
Ravenna
was
too
cool-headed
to
be
affected
by
his
potations
The
two
women
were
once
more
on
good
terms
and
I
was
simply
a
bewildered
looker-on
in
how
do
you
say
it
Si
in
Vienna
I
knew
it
couldn
t
last
but
I
was
not
I
swear
to
you
prepared
for
what
followed
One
night
after
the
lovers
had
literally
torn
them
selves
apart
Dimali
went
with
Pinuti
to
the
wine-house
I
was
soon
off
to
bed
for
we
had
been
singing
Rigoletto
and
I
was
tired
It
must
have
been
long
after
midnight
when
the
sound
of
footsteps
awoke
me
followed
by
a
noise
as
if
some
one
were
lurching
from
wall
to
wall
A
moment
later
I
heard
Dimali
s
voice
thick
with
wine
lustily
trolling
A
muttered
exclamation
from
Pinuti
and
the
song
ceased
Doubtless
a
hand
had
been
clapped
over
the
tenor
s
mouth
to
prevent
him
from
arousing
the
sleeping
household
I
arose
and
opening
my
door
ever
so
little
saw
by
the
dim
lamplight
the
two
men
careening
along
Only
Pinuti
did
not
seem
to
be
very
drunk
for
he
easily
supported
his
companion
He
led
him
much
to
my
surprise
to
his
own
room
and
after
a
few
minutes
came
out
into
the
corridor
and
passing
me
unsuspectingly
went
directly
to
Rosati
s
door
and
knocked
three
times
I
counted
those
knocks
they
were
like
the
knocks
at
the
gate
in
your
Shakespeare
s
Macbeth
In
a
moment
he
was
admitted
and
I
smiled
at
myself
for
my
silly
suspicions
sillier
fears
I
was
turning
to
my
bed
when
my
attention
was
once
more
caught
by
the
sound
of
a
door
softly
closed
I
instantly
tiptoed
to
my
old
post
and
saw
with
a
sur
prise
that
merged
into
horror
the
conductor
and
the
soprano
moving
towards
Pinuti
s
room
wherein
lay
the
drunken
Dimali
As
he
passed
under
the
lamp
Pinuti
paused
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
black
oblong
box
This
sinister
drama
so
upset
my
nerves
that
I
fell
on
my
bed
incapable
of
motion
above
all
incapable
of
raising
my
voice
in
alarm
But
my
brain
was
excru
ciatingly
alive
I
suffered
ten
thousand
hells
as
I
laid
there
and
years
seemed
to
pass
though
I
dare
say
it
couldn
t
have
been
more
than
ten
minutes
before
the
guilty
couple
emerged
from
the
blood-stained
chamber
of
crime
Pinuti
silently
conducted
to
her
room
the
wretched
soprano
Rosati
As
they
passed
me
in
the
semi-darkness
they
looked
like
the
Scotch
family
yes
like
the
Macbeths
The
old
man
trembled
at
the
ghosts
his
memory
had
dug
up
And
did
they
murder
the
tenor
I
interrupted
in
agitated
accents
Agnani
hiccoughed
the
strong
beer
was
beginning
to
tell
on
his
venerable
brain
He
re
sponded
in
mumbling
tones
No
they
didn
t
kill
poor
Dimali
Worse
He
went
away
in
a
few
weeks
Pinuti
was
heart-broken
when
he
at
last
realised
that
he
had
been
used
as
a
handy
tool
by
the
soprano
she
too
disappeared
soon
after
The
manager
failed
the
company
broke
up
and
I
I
be
came
impatient
with
his
drolling
evasiveness
But
what
became
of
Dimali
The
now
thor
oughly
intoxicated
old
ruffian
regarded
me
with
his
cynical
disconcerting
gaze
He
asked
with
a
leer
Have
you
ever
heard
Popelli
s
opera
Abelardo
e
Eloisa
Never
You
have
missed
much
It
is
a
beautiful
score
Dimali
made
the
hit
of
his
career
in
it
I
was
puzzled
As
Abelardo
No
in
the
role
of
Eloisa
I
commanded
two
more
bocks
When
he
left
the
cafe
he
was
giving
an
excellent
imitation
of
the
Leaning
Tower
of
Pisa
only
more
dignified

Vance

Don

He

des
pite
his
poetry
and

I
first
met
him
at
the
old
Eden
Musee
on
Twenty-third
Street
in
1893
where
he
put
on
a
pantomime
of
his
own
with
his
wife
Mile
Severine
and
Pilar
Morin
in
the
cast
He
was
writing
for
The
Commercial

later
he
joined
the
staff
of
The
Musical

Then
he
went
to
France
as

He
published
his
French
Portraits
while
on
The

But
it
is
of
his
Mile

that
I

weeklies
audacious
fearing
neither

this

I
have
ever

To-day

myself
comprised

There
was
no

and
the

mailed
the

Frankly
I
wonder
how
we
escaped
Anthony

Perhaps
our
precious
prose
saved
us
But
the
illustrations
Simply
gorgeous
The
mighty
line
of
Fleming
the
tricky
humour
and
skill
of
Powers
still
a
force
among
New
York
caricaturists
the
wicked
attacks
of
Editor
Thompson
on
society
and
government
and
women
all
these
made
Mile
New

unique
The
make-up
too
of
the
sheet
was
unusual
Printed
in
colours
with
wide
margins
there
were
tiny
pictures
across
the
letter-press
and
impertinent
marginal
comment
In
a
word
Mile
New
York
was
more
Parisian
than
Paris
It
cost
us
a
lot
We
had
to
dive
down
into
our
jeans
to
pay
the
printer
and
paper-man
But
we
had
lots
of
fun
It
was
a
safety-valve
for
our
rank
egotism
and
radi
calism
Every
institution
was
attacked
save
the

Philip
Hale
wrote
a
masterpiece

a
Philip

cult
then
No
wonder
An

in

literally
educated

Why
even
in
such
a
deadly

as

he
brings
a
touch
that
lightens
the

Papa

run
his

through
his

and
desperately
exclaim
What
are
you

to
We
didn

Possibly
to

didn

succeed

in

after
the
shouting
was
over

the

the

was
depressing
Eventually
all

Free
Verse
I
mind
me
of
the
verse
we
printed
twenty-three
years
ago
We
began
in
1895
When
a
clever
literary
hoax
is
discussed
I
recall
the
poetry
personality
above
all
the
ferocious
portrait
of
Lingwood
Evans
an
Aus
tralian
rough-neck
writing
decadent
verse
that
alter
nated
between
the
muffled
morbidities
of
Verlaine
and
the
roaring
free-verse
of
Verhaeren
It
was
one
of
the
most
successful
of
hoaxes
From
editors
and
librarians
came
pouring
in
queries
as
to
the
new
man
His
poetry
was
copied
praised
and
decried
Anarchist
libertine
mystic
he
was
The
Father
of
Livor
and
The
Avenue
of
Farthingales
the
terrific
and
sinister
parody
on
My
Country
Tis
of
Thee
made
people
sit
up
If
an
I
W
W
boasted
such
a
poet
to-day
he
would
get
short
shrift
from
the
government
Yet
it
was
pure
fun
making
of
a
fine
quality
Vance
Thompson
was
Ling
wood
Evans
Tom
Fleming
made
the
woodcuts
so
vital
and
original
in
design
Vance
introduced
European
writers
and

who
since
have
become
celebrated
Knut

the
Pole
Stanislaw
Przybyszewski
not
a

but
the

of

has
been
trans

Maeterlinck
Ibsen
Verlaine
Verhaeren
and
the
entire
lyre
of
the
younger
French
Italian
Spanish
and
Belgian
poets
Edvard
Munch
a
powerful
Norwegian
artist
and
Strindberg
the
Swede
probably
had
their

printed
for
the
first
time
in

in

of

Rupert
Hughes
wrote
his

for
us
When

Harlem
in
which
he
relates
a

of
Slab-sided

O

insipid

with
this

I
looked
after
the
new

in

Thompson
wrote
some
musical

in

sorts
of
free-rhythms

been

but
that
stony
fact
did
not
prevent
him
from
developing
His
slender

I
have

My
favourite
is
his
Ego
Book
replete
with
charm
and
wisdom
Drink

Keep
Sober
the
original
title
is
amusing
and
like
his

on

is
stuffed
with
fallacies
Except
in

and
in

there
is
nothing
to
equal
the

It

simply

Rum

escaped
the
eagle
eye
of
Billy
Sunday
As
for
the
woman
question
I
can
only
quote
a
few
sen
tences
from
Mile
New
York
an
editorial
first
fortnight
in
November
1898
Mind
you
a
man
has
a
right
to
change
his
mind
but
he
should
not
leave
behind
him
an
armoury
of
arguments
to
refute
himself
He
did
this
I
was
then
the
Gynolatrist
How
he
mocked
my
old
fashioned
attitude
towards
Woman
Among
other
things
this
is
what
he
wrote
Here
in
the
United
States
the
worship
of
Woman
is
carried
to
ludicrous
lengths
And
perhaps
in
these
days
when
the
hens
hold
conventions
and
their
fritinancy
disturbs
the
ears
of
thoughtful
men
it
may
not
be
super
fluous
to
iterate
the
old
truth
that
woman
is
physically
mentally
and
morally
inferior
to
man
She
bears
a
cer
tain
resemblance
to
the
masculine
type
She
is
indeed
an
undeveloped
man
Her
place
in
the
scale
of
human
life
is
midway
between
the
adolescent
and
the
viril
As
a
matter
of
fact
her
entire
physical
constitution
fine
skin
frail
bony
structure
beardless
face
feeble
voice
is
nearer
to
that
of
the
boy
than
the
man
This
is
no
place
for
the
consideration
of
the
physiological
proof
of
the
statement
The
proportion
of
red
and
white
cor
puscles
the
caudal
vertebrae
resembling
those
of
the
embryo
or
the
ape
her
very
method
of
breathing
which
is
thoracic
and
not
from
the
diaphragm
the
shape
of
the
head
like
that
of
a
child
or
a
Kaffir
the
grey
substance
of
the
brain
lighter
than
in
man
on
all
these
points
and
a
dozen
others
the
craniologists
biologists
and
an
thropologists
have
spoken
with
authority
Woman
s
physical
inferiority
to
man
is
a
fact
beyond
question
She
is
indeed
an
interesting
study
this
adolescent
animal
with
the
great
white
not
grey
brain
the
phleg
matic
senses
and
the
dulled
finger-tips
But
what
a
damnable
noise
she
makes
at
this
century
s
end
In
letters
painting
science
music
sculpture
nothing
When
with
simian
the
feminine
is
nearer
the
simian
than
the
masculine
ease
they
imitate
the
gestures
of
an
artist
one
must
always
look
in
the
background
for
a
man
Behind
George
Sand
loom
the
pitiful
figures
of
Jules
Sandeau
De
Musset
Chopin
behind
George
Eliot
one
sees
the
bearded
face
of
Lewes
and
so
when
a
fe
male
novelist
deteriorates
or
improves
takes
up
a
new
subject
or
dons
a
new
manner
one
need
but
lightly
say
Eh
bien
She
has
taken
a
new
lover
Sorotic
women
argue
that
man
and
woman
started
equal
that
it
is
only
man
s
tyranny
which
has
degraded
woman
in
the
scale
of
life
So
be
it
Perhaps
this
is
as
good
a
way
as
any
other
of
satisfying
the
feminine
mind
It
begs
the
question
by
acknowledging
the
very
inferiority
at
issue
And
when
will
woman
overtake
man
in
his
ascent
A
and
B
start
from
a
given
point
A
travels
at
a
speed
of
ten
miles
a
day
B
travels
at
a
rate
of
six
miles
a
day
when
will
B
overtake
A
The
hen
has
a
right
to
cackle
only
on
one
occasion
when
she
lays
an
egg
she
never
has
a
right
to
crow
and
by
reason
of
imperfect
thoracic
development
she
never
can
crow
Dear
God
the
crowned
and
laurelled
eunuchs
of
American
literature
professors
with
dandruff
on
the
coat-collar
and
bearded
ladies
and
the
chaste
pantel
leted
spinsters
and
the
little
hairy
poets
all
hungry
and
timid
and
all
bought
and
sold
A
man
may
alter
his
views
twenty
times
as
a
snake
sloughs
its
skin
but
when
he
writes
such
words
words
like
the
virile
ring
of
crossed
blades
then
he
is
primarily
a
Caveman
Who
knows
whether
as
a
sexagenarian
he
may
not
doff
the
garb
of
civilisation
and
emerge
hairy
rugged
in
a
bearskin
and
over
his
virile
shoulders
a
mighty
club
Beware
Woman
Even
in
his
Woman
the
old
masculine
condescension
peeps
forth
He
al
ludes
to
her
as
little
woman
In
Vishnuland
what
Vance
I
wrote
many
so-called
prose-poems
seduced
by
the
examples
of
Baudelaire
Mallarme
and
Huysmans
They
are
to
be
found
scattered
through
Mile
New
York
and
Melomaniacs
Here
is
one
never
before
reprinted
from
Mile
New
York
She
lay
in
the
Hall
of
the
Mirrors
where
repeated
in
evanescent
gestures
her
person
moved
with
processional
precision
She
had
disrobed
to
the
accompaniment
of
soft
hidden
music
and
to
the
unconscious
miming
of
the
mirrors
something
of
fear
and
something
of
shame
were
in
her
heart
as
she
pulled
to
her
pretty
chin
the
royal
counterpane
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
Iain
in
a
palace
and
the
night
seemed
to
hum
with
a
thousand
harps
It
was
the
music
and
the
beating
of
her
heart
that
she
heard
and
she
wondered
most
at
the
heavily
scented
atmosphere
and
smiled
at
the
face
that
smiled
down
at
her
from
the
shining
ceiling
Her
plump
body
sank
in
relaxing
curves
the
very
couch
seemed
to
embrace
her
Then
she
heard
footsteps
and
dared
no
longer
gaze
into
the
ironic
mirror
overhead
As
the
prince
approached
love
loomed
nigh
There
was
no
tenderness
in
his
eyes
and
his
young
forehead
was
slightly
wrinkled
It
was
his
nuptial
night
for
him
was
waiting
a
fair
girl
whose
pulses
leapt
to
the
sound
of
his
voice
But
he
had
no
words
for
her
when
he
reached
the
royal
bed
that
stood
in
the
Hall
of
the
Mirrors
His
troubled
gaze
drove
the
blood
to
her
heart
when
he
sat
beside
her
and
the
music
ceased
and
the
mirrors
grew
grey
and
misty
She
had
waited
for
this
moment
since
her
birth
their
souls
had
been
woven
together
by
im
perial
decree
yet
now
they
circled
about
each
other
like
two
tall
stars
in
interstellar
depths
bound
for
eter
nity
to
tread
in
the
stately
dance
of
the
spheres
aeons
apart
and
destined
never
to
embrace
With
out
stretched
despairing
arms
she
welcomed
her
image
in
the
air
above
her
and
her
impassioned
sorrowful
glance
married
her
to
her
own
soul
The
prince
told
her
in
falsetto
tones
of
his
desire
for
rest
and
she
welcomed
him
as
one
would
a
pet
poodle
beside
his
sleepy
escaping
soul
she
lay
in
the
Hall
of
the
Mirrors
where
repeated
in
evanescent
gestures
her
person
moved
in
processional
sadness
What
does
it
mean
Do
you
remember
the
story
I
told
you
of
that
farewell
stag
dinner
given
at
the
Maison
Felix
to
a
certain
tenor
by
his
friends
principally
brothers-in-law
before
he
married
an
operetta
soprano
My
cryptic
prose
is
the
sequel
of
that
marriage
which
was
speedily
dissolved
because
it
was
not
consummated
But
no
one
would
know
this
from
my
tortured
style
I
was
very
precious
then
and
suffered
though
briefly
from
the
green-sickness
of
too
ambitious
writers
I
tried
my
hand
at
all
sorts
of
imitations
I
was
practising
my
scales
in
public
I
imitated
Maupassant
in
a
tale
Fog
my
first
and
last
essay
in
that
genre
of
demi-monde
imitated
Zangwill
in
The
Shofar
Blew
at
Sunset
which
brought
from
him
a
very
pleasant
letter
imitated
myself
in
Music
the
Conqueror
and
in
Frus
trate
both
of
which
appeared
in
Melomaniacs
How
we
rioted
in
extravagant
comparisons
I
was
mad
over
Maggie
Cline
and
in
pompous
prose
I
saluted
her
as
A
Brunhilda
of
the
Bowery
I
wrote
of
her
and
Apollo
forgive
me
As
Whitman
was
a
great
natural
source
an
impulsive
in
our
native
literature
so
Maggie
Cline
the
exponent
of
muscularity
in
song
is
in
the
musical
world
At
the
magic
of
her
voice
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
present
fade
and
you
are
straightway
transported
to
Eldridge
or
Hester
Street
and
witness
with
beating
heart
and
brain
on
fire
the
downfall
of
that
good
man
and
true
the
doughty
Donovan
or
the
epical
fracas
at
McCIoskey
s
Throw
him
down
McCIoskey
I
treated
her
as
if
she
were
a
Lilli
Lehmann
or
a
Sarah
Bernhardt
It
was
saluted
as
a
new
note
in
criticism
Yvette
Guilbert
didn
t
escape
I
plastered
her
with
epi
thets
until
her
own
mother
wouldn
t
have
recognised
her
She
is
a
singing
Zola
this
Yvette
Guilbert
She
sings
of
the
rogues
beggars
outcasts
drunkards
the
shards
and
estrays
of
life
the
human
offal
the
gutter
s
refuse
She
is
a
singing
Zola
this
Yvette
Guilbert
a
porno
graphic
Zola
a
realist
Zola
a
Zola
of
bestiality
supreme
a
Zola
of
the
love
that
lies
in
wait
and
supplicates
with
a
grimace
It
must
be
remembered
that
Yvette
then
was
not
the
sweet
singer
of
old
French
lyrics
She
was
the
modern
Yvette
a
wonderful
diseuse
and
thrice
as
fascinating
as
in
her
latest
incarnation
MY
DREAM-BARN
About
this
time
I
began
to
suspect
myself
My
spiritual
axis
had
shifted
There
was
somewhere
a
leakage
of
moral
gas
on
my
premises
as
Henry
James
remarked
of
D
Annunzio
I
had
become
dissatisfied
with
my
life
Why
all
this
interest
in
the
work
of
other
men
Couldn
t
I
play
off
my
own
bat
Vance
Thomp
son
encouraged
me
to
write
a
book
So
did
Philip
Hale
I
must
blame
my
subsequent
crimes
on
some
one
Why
waste
hours
every
day
hearing
music
seeing
pic
tures
and
worse
writing
of
them
What
s
Hecuba
to
me
I
was
becoming
neurotic
I
could
sympathise
with
Berlioz
when
he
sneered
at
the
Sonata
Why
just
a
sonata
or
a
symphony
Why
music-drama
or
Shake
speare
Why
not
rum
and
rebellion
or
gals
and
galli
vanting
I
knew
by
that
time
I
couldn
t
have
all
these
things
What
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
gains
his
soul
but
loseth
love
I
was
seizing
the
shadow
for
the
sub
stance
like
the
dog
in
the
fable
I
couldn
t
marry
more
than
one
woman
at
a
time
because
of
certain
social
prejudices
And
sometimes
a
man
s
wife
won
t
let
him
marry
the
girl
he
likes
women
are
so
unreasonable
What
was
I
to
do
Which
way
to
turn
Sensibly
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
concluded
that
my
only
hope
was
a
philistine
life
Poor
old
bourgeois
always
getting
pounded
by
poetical
Bolsheviki
in
reality
the
bourgeois
possessing
horse-sense
Flaubert
warned
his
pupil
Guy
de
Maupassant
that
to
achieve
masterpieces
he
must
be
peaceful
in
his
life
that
he
might
be
violent
in
his
art
Zola
swears
that
Flaubert
led
the
life
of
a
bourgeois
writing
instead
of
selling
groceries
Flaubert
who
his
life
long
pursued
the
bourgeois
with
gibes
Vance
Thompson
used
to
say
that
an
artist
whether
poet
or
painter
musician
or
sculptor
should
marry
the
feather
bed
type
of
woman
She
protects
and
consoles
also
cooks
a
good
dinner
When
artist
mates
with
artist
then
comes
the
tug
of
tongues
No
family
can
harbour
two
prima
donnas
that
is
not
without
fur
flying
The
artistic
temperament
is
catty
whether
male
or
female
Hence
these
tears
Therefore
I
steered
a
middle
course
It
was
in
1895
I
began
to
study
hard
Again
I
drew
up
a
formidable
manifesto
for
my
private
use
I
assailed
my
laziness
of
course
I
ve
never
been
lazy
I
ve
never
had
the
time
It
is
my
spiritual
sloth
I
mean
Goaded
by
my
self-admitted
mediocrity
I
determined
to
be
a
contemporary
if
nothing
more
There
was
leaking
gas
and
my
moral
meter
had
failed
to
register
it
If
I
had
gone
down
on
my
shin
bones
and
echoed
DurtaPs
de
spairing
prayer
in
A
Rebours
by
Huysmans
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
health
of
my
soul
Do
you
recall
it
Take
pity
O
Lord
on
the
Christian
who
doubts
on^the
sceptic
who
desires
to
believe
on
the
convict
of
life
who
embarks
alone
in
the
night
beneath
a
sky
no
longer
lit
by
the
consoling
beacons
of
ancient
faith
It
has
a
liturgical
ring
this
invocation
But
as
I
wrote
of
Baudelaire
I
had
patiently
built
up
my
soul
as
a
perverse
bird
builds
its
nest
bits
of
straw
the
sobbing
of
women
clay
cascades
of
black
stars
rags
leaves
rotten
wood
corroding
dreams
a
spray
of
roses
a
pebble
s
sparkle
a
gleam
of
blue
sky
arabesques
of
incense
and
verdigris
and
for
a
ground
tone
the
abomination
of
desolation
My
soul
was
a
cemetery
of
the
seven
sorrows
I
had
rented
an
Ivory
Tower
but
I
had
lost
the
latch-key
When
She
beckoned
to
me
from
the
topmost
cell
my
Princess
of
Mirrors
and
melancholy
I
could
only
shrug
despairing
shoulders
I
was
a
steeplejack
but
there
were
no
step-ladders
where
with
to
climb
to
her
A
man
can
t
be
both
a
steeplejack
and
a
carpenter
I
could
only
whistle
down
to
the
wind
and
the
Ideal
never
comes
in
answer
to
whistling
I
even
mixed
moral
values
by
quoting
what
Coleridge
attrib
uted
to
Sir
Joshua
Reynolds
The
greatest
man
is
he
who
forms
the
taste
of
a
nation
the
next
greatest
is
he
who
corrupts
it
As
I
hadn
t
the
power
to
form
the
taste
of
my
neighbour
much
less
that
of
a
nation
I
proceeded
to
corrupt
my
own
I
muddled
the
Seven
Arts
in
a
grand
old
stew
I
saw
music
heard
colour
tasted
architecture
smelt
sculpture
and
fingered
per
fume
A
mad
carnival
of
the
senses
I
sympathised
with
Des
Esseintes
in
La-Bas
though
I
didn
t
care
for
his
mouth-organ
of
various
liqueurs
But
I
believed
that
an
art
could
be
interpreted
in
the
terms
of
another
I
read
a
book
by
Suarez
de
Mendoza
L
Audition
Coloree
to
relieve
my
anxiety
It
is
a
search
ing
study
in
false
secondary
sensations
and
deals
with
colour-hearing
or
pseudo-photoesthesie
This
re
sults
from
association
of
ideas
early
established
We
have
most
of
us
been
reminded
of
some
far-away
hap
pening
usually
sentimental
by
the
odour
of
faded
flowers
The
sense
of
smell
plays
a
commanding
role
in
all
sex
manifestations
The
Fathers
of
the
Church
knew
this
hence
their
stern
admonitions
to
women
using
heady
sensual
perfumes
Certain
musical
tones
evoke
certain
colours
And
if
you
investigate
you
will
discover
that
the
aesthetic
terminology
of
painting
resembles
that
of
music
I
believed
in
employing
the
whole
keyboard
of
analogies
so
my
criticism
often
proved
trying
to
my
readers
but
not
to
me
I
needs
must
educate
them
The
arts
are
separate
yet
as
Walter
Pater
says
all
aspire
to
a
condition
of
music
as
our
sun
and
planets
travel
towards
a
central
sun
in
some
remote
constella
tion
But
I
abused
the
scheme
and
I
am
not
sorry
You
write
of
music
as
if
it
were
a
living
thing
said
Arthur
Symons
to
me
in
a
memorable
letter
Music
is
a
living
thing
for
me
as
living
as
any
vital
organism
It
lives
when
it
enters
the
porches
of
my
ears
and
it
is
a
living
memory
To
write
about
it
is
quite
hopeless
You
can
describe
a
picture
a
statue
a
cathedral
and
quote
a
poem
but
you
may
not
describe
a
symphony
The
best
way
out
of
the
dilemma
is
to
follow
in
the
foot
steps
of
the
music-reporter
Tell
me
a
news
story
If
you
attempt
a
subjective
explanation
you
run
the
risk
of
not
being
intelligible
The
technical
method
has
its
perils
it
is
understood
only
by
musicians
None
the
less
did
I
persevere
in
my
endeavour
to
achieve
a
syn
thesis
of
the
arts
The
result
may
be
foreseen
Yet
I
have
heard
music
that
gave
me
the
illusion
of
light
of
air
music
that
was
as
diaphanous
as
the
spider
s
web
in
the
gold
of
the
setting
sun
music
as
keen
as
a
Damascene
blade
that
halves
a
lace
veil
as
melancholy
as
the
thoughts
of
a
woman
in
travail
but
it
demands
high
courage
to
make
one
s
self
ridiculous
and
to
write
in
such
a
style
would
be
grazing
the
fatuous
Chopin
and
Shelley
are
alike
to
me
as
are
Wagner
and
Browning
Raphael
and
Mozart
Beethoven
and
Shakespeare
I
lived
at
the
corner
of
Madison
Avenue
and
Seventy
sixth
Street
for
fifteen
years
in
the
CarroIIton
one
of
the
first
tall
apartment
houses
in
that
section
of
the
city
Big
old-fashioned
rooms
high
windows
stone
balconies
on
the
tenth
floor
gave
me
plenty
of
light
air
and
a
view
that
was
inspiring
There
were
few
obstructions
in
1899
between
my
Dream-Barn
and
Staten
Island
I
could
sweep
all
the
East
River
and
the
Hudson
too
I
could
see
the
harbour
maculated
with
craft
see
the
bay
the
Statue
of
Liberty
steamships
going
and
coming
From
my
wide
windows
facing
Central
Park
I
caught
the
copper
gleam
of
the
erect
synagogue
at
Seventy-sixth
Street
and
the
Avenue
beyond
was
the
placid
toy
lake
with
its
rim
of
moving
children
the
trees
smoothly
swept
in
a
huge
semi-circle
at
their
verge
was
the
driveway
The
glow
of
summer
afternoons
the
purity
of
the
air
and
the
glancing
metal
on
the
rolling
cars
and
carriages
made
a
gay
picture
for
me
My
studio
was
rather
bare
I
hate
cluttered-up
rooms
The
severe
line
of
the
low
bookcases
was
relieved
by
the
curves
of
my
beloved
Steinway
grand
A
few
pictures
Ernest
Lawson
land
scapes
a
head
by
George
Luks
a
study
by
Thomas
Sully
completed
the
ensemble
Add
a
desk
once
the
property
of
Thaddeus
Stevens
and
the
inevitable
cast-iron
lamp
depending
from
an
oak
beam
and
you
may
realise
that
it
was
not
a
difficult
task
to
write
a
dozen
books
amid
such
surroundings
Only
those
skylights
The
roof
was
almost
composed
of
glass
There
was
an
excellent
northern
light
for
artists
old-fashioned
enough
to
believe
in
any
particular
lighting
and
during
a
rain-storm
the
patter
and
swish
kept
me
awake
I
ve
heard
sentimental
persons
say
Oh
to
be
here
as
the
rain
gently
drips
What
an
inspiration
But
it
seldom
dripped
it
usually
cannonaded
and
during
a
thunder-storm
the
lightning
flashes
were
too
intimate
for
nervous
people
I
recall
one
night
when
Rafael
Joseffy
was
there
He
looked
under
the
pianoforte
saying
it
was
the
one
spot
where
he
could
escape
the
blaze
of
the
electric
tempest
Francis
Hackett
the
critic
came
in
and
Edward
Marsh
of
Mac
millan
s
and
Frederick
James
Gregg
of
The
Evening
Sun
but
we
could
not
persuade
Joseffy
to
stay
He
said
that
we
might
as
well
be
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
which
was
true
and
when
the
building
rocked
in
a
hurricane
the
illusion
of
being
afloat
was
strengthened
I
loved
my
old
Dream-Barn
and
as
one
chap
remarked
a
news
paper
man
lives
on
views
and
I
had
from
my
windows
not
one
but
a
dozen
Life
and
letters
pictures
and
music
They
were
woven
into
a
close
strand
I
read
I
wrote
I
played
An
excel
lent
epitaph
I
was
forced
to
create
my
own
atmosphere
else
grow
stale
and
perish
in
the
vacuum
The
artistic
roots
of
our
life
are
not
deeply
bedded
in
the
national
soul
I
was
and
still
am
a
lover
of
the
new
Irish
litera
ture
I
wrote
much
of
Yeats
George
Russell
and
Synge
later
of
James
Stephens
and
James
Joyce
I
believe
that
George
Moore
on
his
native
soil
is
better
than
he
is
in
England
or
even
France
which
is
saying
a
lot
Ireland
not
only
has
produced
her
greatest
novelist
in
Moore
but
her
most
alluring
lyric
poet
in
Yeats
I
met
Yeats
at
the
home
of
John
Quinn
Synge
with
his
Maeterlinc
kian
atmosphere
which
modulates
into
the
melancholy
mists
of
the
Quid
Sod
created
a
new
thrill
James
Stephens
and
his
rich
fantasy
squeezing
golden
wine
from
leanest
grapes
a
genuine
Irish
genius
in
whose
heart
bubbles
fantasy
and
tears
and
Joyce
a
gloriously
bitter
Banshee
wailing
Ireland
and
the
Irish
in
a
voice
all
his
own
these
and
many
of
the
minor
lyrists
quite
overflowed
our
horizons
Contemporary
English
litera
ture
has
nothing
to
equal
these
men
in
originality
raci
ness
spiritual
depth
or
magic
Edgar
Saltus
always
has
been
one
of
my
pet
authors
He
is
elect
among
lovers
of
style
Setting
aside
his
fiction
what
writer
with
the
exception
of
William
James
can
make
such
charming
and
conclusive
expositions
of
philosophy
as
Mr
Saltus
And
without
pretensions
as
a
professional
metaphysician
We
must
go
to
France
for
his
counterpart
I
possess
thanks
to
him
one
of
the
rare
impressions
of
his
Oscar
Wilde
An
Idler
s
Impression
which
fairly
sums
up
the
personality
and
gifts
of
that
unhappy
Irishman
Mr
Saltus
writes
as
a
coda
Apart
from
that
it
he
is
speaking
of
morality
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
arts
except
the
art
of
never
displeasing
which
in
itself
is
the
whole
secret
of
mediocrity
Oscar
Wilde
lacked
that
art
and
I
can
think
of
no
better
epitaph
for
him
This
is
Wilde
in
an
epigram
But
Saltus
is
our
most
brilliant
writer
and
epigrams
may
be
expected
from
him
I
have
no
grievances
I
am
what
I
made
myself
therefore
I
blame
myself
for
my
shortcomings
As
I
loathe
the
brand
of
any
particular
school
or
movement
in
art
so
I
detest
the
fellow
who
lays
the
blame
of
his
troubles
on
some
one
else
usually
his
wife
Friends
have
praised
me
but
I
don
t
deserve
that
praise
I
never
aimed
at
anything
and
if
I
anticipated
others
in
discovering
presumptuous
word
certain
of
the
new
men
in
Europe
and
America
it
was
because
of
my
critical
curiosity
also
because
a
newspaper
man
has
a
scent
for
news
I
mention
America
as
some
critics
believe
me
to
be
on
my
knees
before
European
culture
The
late
Percival
Pollard
a
capital
critic
devoted
a
chapter
to
me
in
his
book
Their
Day
in
Court
He
said
that
I
neglected
Americans
when
as
I
told
him
I
gained
my
living
by
writing
about
the
painting
composing
litera
ture
and
modelling
of
my
fellow-countrymen
in
The
Etude
Musical
Courier
Recorder
Commercial
Advertiser
Sun
Times
and
the
Philadelphia
Press
For
nearly
four
decades
I
have
done
little
else
but
praise
or
blame
our
native
talents
Many
a
swan
has
turned
goose
but
I
ve
had
white
swans
also
American
painters
and
sculptors
in
particular
have
I
studied
from
Arthur
B
Davies
and
George
Grey
Barnard
to
the
fledgling
illustrator
or
clay
modeller
of
yesterday
I
leave
the
American
composers
to
tell
my
tale
Nor
do
I
fear
that
I
shall
be
accused
of
tepidity
concerning
the
merits
of
our
literature
Hum
bug
I
hate
And
one
venerable
humbug
was
punctured
when
our
new
school
of
landscape
in
this
form
America
is
eminent
proved
triumphant
I
quite
agree
with
Willard
Metcalf
when
he
declared
that
the
further
back
we
go
in
the
history
of
American
art
the
worse
we
find
the
painting
This
is
not
only
true
of
the
Hudson
and
kindred
schools
but
it
holds
good
in
the
case
of
our
por
trait-painters
of
the
past
century
Such
leathery
effi
gies
I
never
could
understand
the
superstitious
ven
eration
entertained
for
second-rate
painters
like
Gilbert
Stuart
Copley
Peale
and
the
rest
of
the
imitators
of
Joshua
Reynolds
and
Thomas
Lawrence
One
brush
stroke
of
Raeburn
is
worth
the
lot
of
them
A
Sargent
or
Chase
portrait
can
t
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
them
They
manufactured
historical
por
traits
like
the
wooden
heads
of
Washington
by
Stuart
and
it
is
as
historical
painters
only
that
they
possess
ar
tistic
justification
Mediocrities
all
And
mediocrities
were
the
mid-century
Landscapists
Imitators
of
Con
stable
and
Gainsborough
and
Claude
George
Inness
is
an
example
of
over-rated
merit
He
was
an
amiable
mediocrity
who
saw
our
native
scene
through
English
spectacles
Yet
he
fetches
big
prices
The
mystic
vision
of
Albert
Ryder
the
grim
power
of
Winslow
Homer
or
the
sumptuous
paint
quality
of
Lawson
are
absent
from
his
work
Our
new
landscape-painters
have
used
their
own
eyes
and
paint
from
a
personal
palette
Their
pre
decessors
are
bogies
for
the
art
dump
in
auction-rooms
It
must
be
nearly
twenty
years
ago
anyhow
eighteen
that
I
entertained
Vladimir
de
Pachmann
in
my
Dream
Barn
on
Madison
Avenue
at
Seventy-sixth
Street
The
tenth
floor
a
room
as
big
and
as
lofty
as
a
cathedral
Alas
where
are
such
old-fashioned
apartments
to-day
After
eating
a
duck
a
kotchka
cooked
Polish
fashion
and
borsch
beet
soup
with
numerous
Slavic
side
dishes
preceded
by
the
inevitable
zakuska
those
appetite
slaying
bonnes
bouches
de
Pachmann
fiercely
demanded
cognac
I
was
embarrassed
Not
drinking
spirits
I
had
inconsiderately
forgotten
the
taste
of
others
De
Pachmann
who
is
a
child
at
heart
too
often
a
naughty
child
cried
to
heaven
that
I
was
a
hell
of
a
host
He
said
this
in
Russian
then
in
French
Italian
German
Polish
Spanish
English
and
wound
up
with
a
hearty
Hebrew
Raca
which
may
mean
hatred
or
revenge
certainly
something
not
endearing
But
the
worst
was
to
come
There
stood
my
big
Steinway
concert
grand
piano
and
he
circled
about
the
instrument
as
if
it
were
a
dangerous
monster
Finally
he
sniffed
and
snapped
My
contract
does
not
permit
me
to
play
a
Steinway
I
hadn
t
thought
of
asking
him
fearing
Chopin
s
classic
retort
after
a
dinner-party
at
Paris
Madame
j
ai
mange
si
peu
Finally
I
saw
the
hole
in
the
mill
stone
and
excused
myself
When
I
returned
with
a
bottle
of
abominable
cognac
the
little
man
s
malicious
smile
changed
to
a
look
of
ecstasy
and
he
was
not
a
drinking
man
ever
but
he
was
accustomed
to
his
petit
verre
after
dining
and
was
ill-tempered
when
deprived
of
it
Such
is
human
nature
something
that
puritans
pro
hibitionists
and
other
pernicious
busybodies
will
never
understand
And
then
this
wizard
lifted
the
fall-board
of
my
piano
and
quite
forgetful
of
that
contract
began
playing
And
how
he
did
play
Ye
gods
Bac
chus
Apollo
and
Venus
and
all
other
pleasant
celestial
persons
how
you
must
have
revelled
when
de
Pachmann
played
In
the
more
intimate
atmosphere
of
my
apart
ment
his
music
was
of
a
gossamer
web
iridescent
aerial
an
seolian
harp
doubled
by
a
diabolic
subtlety
Albert
Ross
Parsons
one
of
the
few
living
pupils
of
Tausig
in
reply
to
my
query
How
did
Joseffy
compare
with
Tausig
answered
Joseffy
was
like
the
multi-coloured
mist
that
encircles
a
mighty
mountain
but
beautiful
So
Pach
mann
s
weaving
enchantments
seemed
in
comparison
to
Godowsky
s
profounder
playing
And
what
did
Vladimir
hero
of
double-notes
play
Nothing
but
Godowsky
then
new
to
me
Liszt
had
been
his
god
but
Godowsky
was
become
his
living
deity
He
had
studied
mastered
and
memorised
all
those
transcen
dental
variations
on
Chopin
studies
the
most
significant
variations
since
the
Brahms-Paganini
scaling
of
the
heights
of
Parnassus
and
I
heard
for
the
first
time
the
paraphrase
of
Weber
s
Invitation
to
the
Valse
a
much
more
viable
arrangement
than
Tausig
s
also
thrice
as
difficult
However
technique
as
sheer
technique
does
not
enter
into
the
musical
zone
of
Godowsky
He
has
restored
polyphony
to
its
central
position
thus
bettering
in
that
respect
Chopin
Schumann
and
Liszt
I
have
called
attention
elsewhere
to
Godowsky
s
solo
sonata
which
evokes
images
of
Chopin
and
Brahms
and
Liszt
Liszt
only
in
the
scherzo
Instead
of
exhuming
such
an
ungrateful
unpianistic
composition
as
Tschaikovsky
s
Sonata
in
G
pianists
of
calibre
might
more
profitably
introduce
the
Godowsky
work
He
is
too
modest
or
else
too
indifferent
to
put
it
on
his
programme
It
lies
so
well
for
the
keyboard
yet
there
is
no
denying
its
difficul
ties
chiefly
polyphonic
the
patterns
are
intricate
though
free
from
the
clogging
effects
of
the
Brahms
sonatas
De
Pachmann
delighted
his
two
auditors
that
night
from
10
P
M
to
3
A
M
It
is
safe
to
wager
that
the
old
CarroIIton
never
heard
such
music-making
before
or
since
When
he
left
happy
over
his
triumph
I
was
actually
flabbergasted
by
the
new
music
he
whispered
Hein
What
you
think
You
think
I
can
play
this
wonderful
music
You
are
mistaken
Wait
till
you
hear
Leopold
Godowsky
play
We
are
all
woodchoppers
compared
with
him
Curiously
enough
the
last
is
the
identical
phrase
uttered
by
Anton
Rubinstein
in
regard
to
Franz
Liszt
Perhaps
it
was
a
quotation
but
de
Pachmann
meant
it
It
was
the
sincerest
sentiment
I
had
heard
from
his
often
insincere
lips
We
were
all
three
surprised
to
find
a
score
of
people
camping
out
on
the
curved
stairway
and
passages
the
idealist
a
coloured
lad
who
ran
the
elevator
having
succumbed
to
sleep
This
impromptu
Godowsky
recital
by
a
marvellous
pian
ist
for
de
Pachmann
was
a
marvel
in
his
time
must
have
made
a
hit
with
my
neighbours
It
did
with
me
and
when
Godowsky
returned
to
New
York
I
had
last
heard
him
in
the
middle
nineties
of
the
previous
century
I
lost
no
time
in
hearing
him
play
in
his
inimita
ble
manner
those
same
works
A
pianist
who
can
win
the
heartiest
admiration
of
such
contemporaries
as
de
Pachmann
and
Joseffy
and
Josef
Hofmann
I
could
adduce
many
other
names
must
be
a
unique
artist
And
that
Godowsky
is
Among
the
younger
American
poets
I
find
one
of
genuine
importance
not
alone
because
of
his
potentiali
ties
but
because
of
his
actual
performance
George
Cabot
Lodge
son
of
Senator
Henry
Cabot
Lodge
died
in
the
very
harvest
time
of
his
undoubted
genius
In
his
Introduction
to
the
two
volumes
of
the
Poems
and
Dramas
Theodore
Roosevelt
has
never
written
with
such
a
mingling
of
perspicacity
and
tempered
enthusiasm
Young
Lodge
was
a
poet
and
his
versatility
may
be
noted
in
these
books
In
his
sonnets
and
lyrics
he
paid
the
ac
customed
tribute
of
youth
to
influences
such
as
Milton
Wordsworth
Meredith
Browning
Tennyson
and
Swin
burne
He
could
mimic
Walt
Whitman
and
he
early
succumbed
to
Schopenhauer
and
Baudelaire
In
at
least
one
of
his
dramas
I
find
the
cosmic
ecstasy
of
Nietzsche
the
doctrine
of
the
Eternal
Return
But
Lodge
had
assimilated
a
half-dozen
cultures
and
had
passed
far
out
to
sea
the
perilous
rocks
of
imitation
upon
which
so
many
lesser
talents
have
come
to
grief
When
we
consider
as
an
achievement
his
Herakles
we
are
amazed
The
poet
the
Maker
is
before
us
and
in
re
clothing
the
antique
and
tragic
myth
in
his
own
lovely
garment
of
speech
he
is
nevertheless
a
modern
of
his
own
times
I
know
few
poets
with
this
sense
of
the
vital
present
added
to
a
divination
and
an
evocation
of
old
unhappy
far-off
things
and
battle
long
ago
His
figures
are
not
fashioned
with
scholastic
black
magic
but
are
living
beings
loving
hating
suffering
and
in
conflict
with
ineluctable
destiny
He
had
the
lyric
art
and
also
the
architectural
He
was
a
singer
and
a
builder
of
the
lofty
rhyme
George
Cabot
Lodge
had
voice
and
vision
His
Life
by
Henry
Adams
proves
him
to
have
been
a
young
man
beloved
by
his
friends
among
whom
were
Langdon
Mitchell
and
the
late
Sir
Cecil
Spring-Rice
I
can
only
add
here
my
humble
mite
of
admiration
and
affection
to
the
names
of
the
vanished
genius
Men
need
not
be
common
because
there
are
many
but
the
infection
of
commonness
once
begun
in
the
many
what
dulness
in
their
future
more
piece
meal
pictures
more
colonial
poetry
more
young
nations
with
withered
traditions
Yet
it
is
before
this
prospect
that
the
provincial
overseas
lifts
up
its
voice
in
a
boast
or
promise
common
enough
among
the
incapable
young
but
pardonable
only
in
senility
He
promised
the
world
a
literature
an
art
that
shall
be
new
because
his
forest
is
untracked
and
his
town
just
built
But
what
the
new
ness
is
he
can
not
tell
Ponder
these
words
They
occur
in
an
essay
by
Alice
Meynell
entitled
Decivilised
and
contained
in
a
slender
volume
called
The
Rhythm
of
Life
Most
of
us
dislike
as
did
James
Russell
Lowell
a
certain
condescension
in
foreigners
yet
the
mellow
wisdom
of
this
Englishwoman
should
not
be
missed
The
deadly
hand
of
vulgarity
is
upon
the
Seven
Arts
Never
have
the
lowlands
so
overflowed
their
ooze
and
muddied
waters
above
the
level
of
our
once
aristocratic
highlands
of
taste
Music
alone
has
thus
far
resisted
the
invasion
of
low
ideals
but
in
opera
the
edifice
is
already
tottering
Poetry
fiction
the
theatres
Alas
But
I
am
opti
mistic
withal
No
nation
boasting
such
high
heroisms
no
nation
after
such
a
baptism
of
blood
and
fire
can
long
dally
in
the
swamp
of
the
banal
or
the
vulgar
And
I
know
that
I
am
not
alone
in
my
hope
of
an
approaching
renascence
of
the
arts
in
our
beloved
America
New
York
like
London
is
a
city
where
you
can
dis
appear
from
the
view
of
your
own
little
world
by
simply
crossing
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
When
I
left
the
theatres
for
art
I
also
left
Broadway
and
patrolled
Fifth
Avenue
which
is
picture-land
I
was
reported
missing
by
my
friends
the
actors
dramatic
critics
and
managers
When
I
ceased
writing
about
music
and
musicians
and
devoted
my
time
to
literary
criticism
I
was
supposed
to
be
in
Europe
Curious
vast
city
where
you
are
dead
if
you
stay
away
from
your
usual
haunts
a
day
I
fancy
the
wish
is
father
to
the
thought
Yet
I
never
was
idle
not
even
in
Europe
I
was
breasting
in
another
current
that
s
all
There
were
rumours
that
I
had
re
tired
to
a
monastery
I
read
this
in
a
musical
journal
What
a
recluse
our
erstwhile
ubiquitous
friend
James
Huneker
has
become
I
was
not
a
recluse
I
merely
stayed
away
from
Carnegie
Hall
and
the
Opera
House
where
musical
folk
mostly
do
congregate
hence
the
hasty
inference
It
is
true
the
story
that
one
family
can
live
next
door
to
another
for
years
and
not
know
names
That
is
a
little
trait
of
Gotham
We
are
not
neighbourly
and
while
I
remember
Yorkville
and
Harlem
when
people
sat
on
their
stoops
of
summer
nights
that
time
has
gone
New
Cosmopolis
is
no
place
for
provincial
customs
I
mention
this
recluse
story
because
I
have
been
often
teased
by
my
friends
on
the
subject
When
I
turned
up
at
the
opera
I
would
be
greeted
with
Hello
Farmer
I
begin
my
morning
with
Bach
end
with
Bach
Bach
the
Alpha
and
Omega
of
music
But
en
joyable
as
it
is
to
read
the
charming
fiction
of
an
un
known
listener
an
inscription
in
one
of
his
books
by
Arthur
Symons
is
still
more
gratifying
It
runs
To
James
Huneker
in
memory
of
the
night
when
he
played
Chopin
at
Lauderdale
Mansions
May
31
1905
I
had
played
there
in
May
1903
when
I
first
met
the
dis
tinguished
Englishman
one
of
the
few
critics
since
Walter
Pater
who
writes
criticism
as
if
it
were
a
fine
art
and
not
a
dismal
science
I
love
the
high
places
of
our
world
I
am
never
giddy
when
standing
on
balconies
or
looking
over
precipices
or
swooping
aloft
in
an
airplane
Possibly
fifteen
years
on
a
tenth
floor
accustomed
my
eyes
to
vast
perspectives
But
contrariwise
when
I
am
in
a
small
room
or
under
ground
or
in
a
cave
even
though
it
be
the
Mammoth
Cave
in
Kentucky
I
feel
that
death
is
not
afar
Once
in
the
catacombs
at
Rome
I
nearly
suffocated
more
from
the
idea
than
the
reality
of
being
buried
alive
I
believe
the
name
of
this
aversion
to
enclosed
space
is
Claustro
phobia
and
I
am
convinced
that
in
my
case
it
is
a
pro
drome
of
apoplexy
Important
if
true
Yet
the
trait
may
have
influenced
my
mental
attitude
towards
the
arts
I
shan
t
say
that
I
have
no
prejudices
for
then
I
should
be
a
colourless
monster
It
is
his
prejudices
that
makes
vital
a
critic
s
work
George
Moore
has
rather
horridly
suggested
that
a
critic
is
always
remembered
by
his
mistakes
which
are
his
prejudices
expressed
Catholicity
in
taste
and
judgment
has
been
my
aim
sometimes
my
undoing
The
half
is
better
than
the
whole
but
for
me
the
too
much
is
too
little
Again
a
case
of
personal
temperament
MY
ZOO
In
my
artistic
and
literary
Zoo
there
are
many
queer
creatures
but
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
them
all
freaks
Brahms
and
Stendhal
are
not
freaks
though
with
the
innate
perversity
that
lurks
in
the
heart
of
critics
I
was
asked
why
I
didn
t
write
of
Beethoven
when
I
had
made
an
elaborate
study
of
Brahms
or
about
Balzac
when
I
revived
the
name
of
Henry
Beyle
My
answer
is
simplicity
itself
because
at
the
time
I
preferred
Brahms
and
Stendhal
Not
that
I
placed
them
near
the
thrones
of
Beethoven
and
Balzac
but
as
worthy
of
the
sincere
attention
of
a
critic
besides
Beethoven
and
Balzac
like
Shakespeare
have
been
the
themes
of
the
master
minds
of
criticism
Goethe
Sainte-Beuve
Taine
Georg
Brandes
It
was
the
same
when
I
defended
Ibsen
and
discovered
Strindberg
I
suppose
that
my
titles
aroused
the
notion
that
the
talented
men
and
women
of
whom
I
wrote
were
semi-lunatics
Nietzsche
died
a
melancholy
invalid
but
he
was
never
mad
neurasthenic
I
should
say
Maeter
linck
is
the
sanest
of
men
So
was
Liszt
so
Chopin
However
I
am
not
setting
up
an
alibi
for
the
sanity
of
my
favourite
artists
and
writers
It
is
not
necessary
There
is
take
it
by
and
large
more
madness
among
medi
ocre
persons
A
little
madness
is
a
necessary
ingredient
in
the
composition
of
genius
Nor
do
I
claim
that
my
apes
peacocks
unicorns
egoists
visionaries
melo
maniacs
and
steeplejacks
are
all
geniuses
Again
medi
ocrity
is
to
the
fore
a
mediocrity
tempered
by
eccen
tricities
There
is
no
bigger
humbug
than
the
fellow
who
sports
the
insignia
of
genius
the
long
hair
and
doubtful
linen
the
alcoholism
and
the
boresome
boast
ing
As
Charlie
McLellan
said
of
one
man
who
thought
he
looked
like
Shakespeare
because
he
had
a
high
bald
forehead
and
hair
worn
as
in
the
Chandos
portrait
I
dare
him
to
keep
his
hat
on
The
shining
dome
exposed
the
man
and
made
an
impression
on
the
unthinking
his
hat
on
and
he
became
Mr
Everyman
Shave
some
of
the
Shavians
and
naught
remains
But
I
never
bothered
with
the
externals
of
such
geniuses
My
most
successful
book
was
Iconoclasts
1905
It
is
my
best
seller
though
Chopin
is
a
close
second
My
favourite
book
is
Egoists
consequently
it
has
been
the
most
assailed
I
have
never
attempted
the
didactic
not
even
in
my
various
educational
editions
of
Chopin
Brahms
Tschaikovsky
or
Richard
Strauss
I
collabor
ated
with
Rafael
Joseffy
in
the
new
Schirmer
edition
of
Chopin
but
confined
my
analysis
to
non-technicalities
though
in
my
Chopin
two-thirds
of
the
volume
is
purely
technical
In
the
case
of
Egoists
I
let
the
grouping
sig
nify
its
individualistic
tendency
William
James
in
one
of
his
letters
complains
that
the
book
lacked
conse
quenz
to
which
I
cheerfully
agreed
I
prefer
to
sug
gest
rather
than
explain
it
is
an
oblique
method
but
so
am
I
constituted
That
is
why
I
am
in
a
minor
degree
a
symbolist
The
majority
of
critical
writings
here
and
in
England
are
as
insipid
as
a
bald
hoarding
In
France
criticism
is
an
art
and
I
have
long
worshipped
at
the
shrines
of
Sainte-Beuve
Taine
and
Anatole
France
But
my
favourite
books
because
they
were
despised
and
rejected
are
my
Melomaniacs
and
Visionaries
Mr
H
L
Mencken
brilliant
and
individual
critic
to
whom
I
owe
more
than
a
lakh
of
metaphorical
rupees
for
his
interest
in
my
work
wrote
that
I
hadn
t
much
talent
for
fic
tion
And
it
was
the
one
thing
of
which
I
had
hoped
he
would
say
the
reverse
not
that
I
think
I
have
but
when
you
possess
a
weakness
it
is
always
nice
to
be
coddled
But
Mr
Mencken
is
no
coddler
Furthermore
he
best
likes
a
little
volume
of
parodies
entitled
Old
Fogy
which
first
appeared
in
The
Etude
None
the
less
I
shall
not
lose
courage
One
of
my
stories
The
Lord
s
Prayer
in
B
is
in
three
foreign
languages
It
was
written
while
musi
cal
tones
drove
me
frantic
Hence
the
leading-motive
torture
by
tonal
reiteration
Octave
Mirbeau
used
the
same
theme
in
his
Le
Jardin
des
Supplices
a
bell
is
tolled
over
the
head
of
a
criminal
in
China
who
dies
from
the
noise
My
Lord
s
Prayer
in
B
first
appeared
in
The
Musical
Courier
March
1896
later
it
headed
the
tales
comprised
in
Melomaniacs
Therein
I
tried
to
bottle
my
chimeras
After
the
book
came
out
I
met
Jeannette
Gilder
and
she
reproached
me
You
of
all
men
from
you
I
expected
the
real
fiction
about
music
I
replied
It
is
not
only
about
music
but
it
is
music
itself
and
then
wondered
what
I
meant
I
had
avoided
the
senti
mental
raptures
of
the
Charles
Auchester
and
The
First
Violin
type
of
musical
novels
endeavouring
to
make
music
the
hero
That
is
why
Arthur
Symons
said
that
I
wrote
as
if
music
was
a
living
thing
I
know
of
no
other
book
of
musical
fiction
that
is
music
dealt
with
imaginatively
like
Melomaniacs
It
derives
a
little
from
E
T
W
Hoffmann
and
his
grotesques
and
it
leans
a
lot
on
Poe
who
with
Chopin
was
my
earliest
passion
But
the
treatment
is
my
own
The
trouble
is
that
these
stories
demand
both
a
trained
musical
reader
and
a
lover
of
fiction
not
a
combination
to
be
found
growing
on
grapevines
Visionaries
is
less
novel
In
it
The
Third
Kingdom
is
the
best
invention
and
that
may
have
un
consciously
stemmed
from
that
golden
casuist
Anatole
France
But
enough
of
this
gossip
about
my
step
children
my
paper
hostages
to
fortune
I
have
referred
to
my
writings
for
one
reason
I
believe
such
references
will
help
my
publishers
up
the
steep
and
stony
path
of
their
profession
One
s
publishers
should
be
encour
aged
By
giving
your
precious
ideas
between
covers
to
a
world
eager
for
them
they
also
after
infinite
pains
may
earn
an
humble
competency
You
have
done
a
good
deed
MY
BEST
FRIEND
Enemies
are
sometimes
friends
in
disguise
Listen
When
I
heard
the
news
I
was
writing
a
letter
to
John
Quinn
my
legal
counsel
in
which
I
exposed
with
merciless
logic
and
rhetorical
emphasis
the
deceit
and
villainy
of
Fulbert
The
thing
was
as
plain
as
daylight
Not
a
link
in
my
chain
of
wrathful
accusations
seemed
weak
or
misplaced
The
man
was
a
liar
perhaps
worse
in
any
case
a
cold-hearted
wretch
Had
he
not
said
in
public
print
and
under
a
flaring
a
vulgar
head-line
that
an
aunt
had
been
the
muse
of
Ibsen
hence
my
admiration
for
the
Norwegian
and
his
work
It
was
pure
falsehood
My
aunt
probably
read
Tupper
and
Felicia
Hemans
and
while
she
had
been
in
Norway
she
was
the
wife
of
a
sea-captain
a
Norwegian
Thrane
by
name
she
may
have
seen
the
poet
but
that
she
played
the
flattering
role
of
his
muse
is
doubtful
His
own
wife
s
sister
Camilla
CoIIett
was
one
for
a
brief
period
It
was
the
way
Fulbert
put
the
thing
that
had
infuriated
me
And
as
I
paused
in
my
writing
Tarver
rushed
in
with
the
evening
paper
Fulbert
was
dead
Yes
Fulbert
my
chief
foe
the
foe
that
had
watched
and
blocked
every
move
in
my
career
had
dropped
dead
after
leav
ing
his
office
where
no
doubt
he
had
written
another
of
his
vile
attacks
upon
my
new
book
But
Fulbert
dead
I
turned
towards
the
window
so
as
to
keep
from
my
friend
the
emotion
that
wrinkled
my
lips
Fulbert
dead
At
last
Had
I
even
longed
for
this
consumma
tion
How
often
had
I
not
prayed
to
the
gods
prayed
in
the
night
that
the
malicious
devil
who
boldly
signed
himself
Fulbert
would
when
besotted
by
drink
drug
himself
into
imbecility
And
now
he
was
dead
the
venomous
dog
Fulbert
dead
I
said
in
almost
a
jocular
tone
What
in
the
world
will
I
do
for
an
enemy
You
know
Tarver
he
was
mine
ancient
enemy
and
I
hold
as
a
theory
that
a
man
s
enemies
do
him
less
ill
than
his
friends
and
For
heaven
s
sake
stop
your
cold
blooded
chatter
and
let
the
poor
devil
rest
1
When
we
reached
the
street
Tarver
proposed
a
drink
but
I
refused
I
did
not
feel
in
the
humour
He
lifted
cynical
eyebrows
Oh
very
well
if
you
expect
the
same
fate
as
your
friend
Fulbert
I
ll
leave
you
to
your
meditations
I
suppose
you
will
send
a
wreath
to
the
funeral
And
this
from
the
man
who
a
moment
before
had
called
me
cold
blooded
I
was
glad
to
be
alone
What
beastly
wit
No
I
wouldn
t
send
flowers
nor
would
I
write
to
the
widow
I
had
known
her
long
before
her
marriage
to
Fulbert
Poor
Fulbert
Well
why
not
The
fellow
was
dead
and
as
Helen
had
married
him
it
was
her
affair
pshaw
He
had
never
wanted
her
really
Only
Fulbert
Why
that
particular
man
Why
Fulbert
I
walked
rapidly
unconsciously
frowning
Several
ac
quaintances
passed
but
I
pretended
not
to
see
them
They
smiled
Decidedly
they
took
me
for
a
queer
bird
All
writers
are
queer
One
man
familiarly
hooked
my
arm
with
his
stick
Hello
there
old
chappie
I
see
your
friend
has
passed
in
his
chips
Going
to
wear
crepe
Oh
for
God
s
sake
my
humour
was
black
don
t
mock
at
death
Phew
was
all
I
heard
as
I
turned
into
a
side
street
ruminating
on
that
already
old
yet
ever
new
text
Fulbert
dead
At
the
end
of
a
fortnight
I
began
to
suffer
from
a
certain
inquietude
Some
poison
was
fermenting
in
my
veins
My
nerves
played
me
tricks
I
could
not
work
Instead
I
stared
at
the
city
streaked
like
a
map
beneath
my
tenth-floor
apartment
I
could
see
the
two
cities
meet
at
the
Battery
and
I
watched
the
white
fleecy
cloud-boulders
vanguard
of
a
thunder-storm
move
in
processional
splendour
across
the
lower
bay
I
could
not
read
I
could
not
write
My
new
book
had
appeared
and
a
glance
at
the
press-clippings
told
me
that
it
was
being
praised
Not
a
club
stroke
from
hostile
critic
not
an
acid
stab
from
an
enemy
Had
I
enemies
no
longer
Had
they
been
concentrated
in
the
person
of
Fulbert
that
Fulbert
who
was
dead
and
cremated
I
pondered
the
idea
My
own
careless
words
like
curses
were
coming
home
to
roost
in
my
skull
Without
an
enemy
I
had
often
said
a
man
of
talent
is
like
unploughed
soil
What
an
infernal
paradox
An
enemy
why
I
had
them
by
the
score
Yet
not
such
a
master-hand
as
Fulbert
Fulbert
it
was
who
had
eagerly
awaited
my
first
book
and
with
a
devilishness
almost
feminine
had
praised
it
pouring
into
every
phrase
a
double-distilled
corrosive
flattery
that
withered
all
it
touched
The
poor
little
volume
soon
shrivelled
up
and
died
In
the
face
of
such
diabolic
appreciation
all
other
criticism
must
perforce
pale
or
seem
fatuous
This
had
been
a
favourite
method
of
the
dead
man
He
alone
possessed
the
subtle
syllabic
tact
for
such
critical
assassinations
And
my
first
fiction
That
had
succumbed
to
the
trumpet-blasts
of
laughter
consummately
Rabelaisian
ventral
laughter
permeated
by
false
bonhomie
Focussing
the
strong
light
of
ridicule
upon
my
ideas
perverting
my
intention
and
caricaturing
my
heroics
Fulbert
slaughtered
my
book
so
merrily
withal
that
no
suspicion
attached
to
the
butcher
the
butchery
itself
had
been
irresistibly
comical
So
it
had
gone
on
for
years
book
after
book
had
been
attacked
in
the
same
surprisingly
cruel
and
original
fashion
The
ingenuity
of
Fulbert
was
Satanic
He
always
bowed
pleasantly
to
his
victim
Once
at
a
friendly
board
we
met
Mrs
Fulbert
was
in
the
com
pany
and
her
husband
as
if
to
show
off
his
critical
paces
cried
across
the
table
to
me
Ah
my
old
friend
the
writer
Are
you
going
to
give
us
your
accustomed
improvisation
on
the
piano
this
evening
Mrs
Ful
bert
turned
her
head
so
as
not
to
smile
in
my
face
The
others
laughed
So
did
I
But
I
almost
strangled
in
the
effort
I
felt
sorry
for
the
widow
Of
course
the
critic
had
died
without
leaving
her
a
penny
after
a
manner
of
most
critics
and
the
poor
woman
in
an
unin
teresting
condition
was
forced
to
move
from
the
city
Did
it
concern
me
I
couldn
t
gloat
over
her
trouble
I
couldn
t
revenge
myself
by
asking
her
hand
in
marriage
I
am
not
of
a
melodramatic
turn
Fulbert
was
dead
And
I
would
follow
him
in
a
few
years
perhaps
sooner
than
I
expected
I
gazed
across
the
East
River
The
bridges
with
their
gaunt
framework
evoked
the
image
of
some
archaic
heaven-storming
machine
some
impious
Babel
built
by
God-hating
men
seeking
to
emulate
the
secret
of
the
skies
Without
knowing
why
I
sighed
Life
seemed
empty
My
old
ambitions
relaxed
and
fell
away
Wasn
t
my
hatred
only
a
surface
irritation
an
author
s
lacerated
vanity
Hadn
t
Fulbert
s
attacks
stung
my
sensitive
epidermis
forcing
me
to
fight
urging
me
to
finer
work
to
wider
conquests
Would
indis
criminate
praise
have
accomplished
a
like
result
In
a
grim
mood
I
again
turned
to
the
window
and
launched
my
gaze
towards
Long
Island
Over
there
over
at
Fresh
pond
what
was
once
Fulbert
now
lay
enclosed
in
an
urn
I
could
not
keep
my
thoughts
from
that
urn
In
it
were
the
burned
bones
of
my
adversary
Mechanically
I
picked
up
my
hat
and
went
down
into
the
street
Presently
I
was
riding
across
Williamsburg
bridge
The
approach
was
like
the
road
to
any
cemetery
Little
one-story
edifices
with
black
gaping
entrances
displayed
mortuary
ornaments
metallic
wreaths
hideous
emblems
banners
of
supreme
ugliness
marble
shafts
pointing
dirty
white
digits
to
the
sky
botched
carved
angels
perched
on
shapeless
lumps
of
granite
all
invit
ing
the
sorrowing
sentimental
poor
to
purchase
and
at
bargain
prices
Opposite
the
cemetery
was
a
huge
hostelry
for
man
beast
and
mourners
which
funeral
parties
frequented
there
to
enjoy
the
baked
meats
and
copious
fluid
refreshment
Oh
the
desperate
jollity
of
those
gatherings
at
which
the
bereaved
were
inwardly
strengthened
and
helped
by
their
friends
to
bear
their
burden
of
woe
in
an
unfeeling
world
No
matter
the
doleful
faces
coming
on
departing
they
were
flushed
and
bore
an
expression
of
specious
comfort
Every
day
there
was
a
sepulchral
comminglement
of
black-robed
women
children
men
hurrying
to
and
fro
gabbling
excitedly
swallowing
the
food
hastily
set
before
them
while
the
waiters
accustomed
to
this
bedlam
of
gluttony
and
grief
rushed
in
and
around
the
groups
seated
or
stand
ing
frantic
because
of
conflicting
orders
glad
to
pitch
anything
on
the
table
hardly
waiting
for
their
fees
and
never
thanking
guests
for
tips
From
the
adjacent
crema
tory
a
veritable
mausoleum
came
the
sound
of
solemn
music
And
from
a
tall
chimney
could
be
seen
a
clear
flame
the
essence
of
some
burned
body
winging
its
way
to
the
infinite
inane
I
hastily
passed
this
melancholy
banquet
hall
and
found
myself
in
the
Columbarium
It
was
an
impressive
chamber
No
hint
of
furnace
The
architecture
with
its
calm
classic
touch
was
thrown
into
relief
by
the
severe
tones
of
an
organ
hidden
from
view
A
service
had
con
cluded
Some
lingered
to
watch
their
precious
dead
consigned
to
the
purifying
fire
With
reverential
feel
ings
I
saw
the
speedy
end
of
a
fellow
human
contrasting
this
antique
mode
with
a
ghastly
open
grave
clods
of
earth
harshly
falling
upon
the
coffin
The
music
ceased
Questioning
an
attendant
I
was
directed
to
an
upper
gallery
There
after
a
short
search
I
found
a
compart
ment
in
which
was
lodged
a
new
urn
It
bore
the
name
of
my
enemy
A
great
loneliness
invaded
my
soul
There
was
Fulbert
dead
and
forever
dead
No
one
had
so
hated
me
No
one
had
taken
such
an
interest
in
me
When
I
had
felt
this
critical
surgeon
s
knife
in
my
inner
most
fibres
I
realised
that
the
surgeon
had
performed
his
task
with
a
loving
hatred
He
knew
every
line
I
had
written
He
had
read
me
studied
me
gloried
in
me
as
a
field
on
which
to
display
his
wit
and
cruelty
What
if
he
did
wound
the
victim
Does
the
life-saver
hate
you
when
he
scientifically
carves
your
leg
from
your
body
Are
you
not
merely
a
subject
for
his
technical
skill
Did
Fulbert
ever
hate
me
Did
I
not
serve
him
as
an
excuse
to
exhibit
his
pen
prowess
Who
had
so
faithfully
kept
my
name
before
the
public
Who
would
ever
take
the
same
interest
He
was
my
spiritual
run
ning-mate
I
was
made
to
go
in
double-harness
with
him
created
by
the
ironical
gods
on
high
who
mock
at
the
teased
destinies
of
suffering
humanity
With
blurred
eyes
I
spied
upon
the
urn
I
read
the
inscription
Henry
Fulbert
Aged
45
years
Nothing
more
And
then
leaning
heavily
against
the
enclosure
my
cheeks
feverish
I
spoke
aloud
He
was
my
best
friend
I
am
lonely
without
Fulbert
AUTOGRAPH
LETTERS
Yes
and
autographed
pictures
how
many
My
correspondence
with
famous
men
and
women
well
known
writers
musicians
painters
sculptors
actors
clergymen
and
men
in
political
life
would
make
a
fat
volume
especially
if
I
included
their
signed
photo
graphs
Many
of
my
correspondents
I
never
met
never
even
saw
Yet
truly
I
could
borrow
Browning
s
title
How
It
Strikes
a
Contemporary
as
a
caption
for
copious
comment
on
interesting
people
In
1884
or
1885
I
received
a
letter
undated
from
Friederich
Nietzsche
written
in
French
I
believe
that
setting
aside
the
late
Karl
Knortz
of
Tarrytown
a
poet
I
was
one
of
the
first
American
correspondents
of
this
poet
and
phi
losopher
who
has
written
the
most
savage
attacks
against
his
fellow
countrymen
since
Heine
and
Schopenhauer
His
hatred
of
the
Prussian
regime
is
openly
expressed
He
said
at
a
time
when
Richard
Wagner
was
giving
lip
service
to
the
conquerors
of
France
that
war
had
brutal
ised
Germany
with
a
consequent
deterioration
of
its
culture
and
remember
that
despite
his
delicate
health
Nietzsche
had
served
in
the
ambulance
section
during
menter
of
war
though
he
has
defined
Prussia
as
long
legs
and
obedience
His
doctrine
of
the
superman
should
be
taken
in
a
spiritual
sense
only
I
saw
his
sister
at
the
Nietzsche
Archive
Weimar
where
I
went
after
data
for
my
Liszt
book
ten
years
ago
Elizabeth
Foerster-Nietzsche
is
a
good-looking
intellectual
lady
de
voted
to
the
memory
of
her
brother
and
writing
much
about
him
She
told
me
that
his
Polish
blood
was
a
delusion
There
is
no
Polish
blood
in
the
family
The
father
was
a
God-fearing
old-fashioned
pastor
and
I
recognise
in
the
son
much
of
the
evangelical
spirit
I
saw
the
piazza
on
which
he
looked
from
upper
Weimar
over
the
Thuringian
landscape
There
he
would
sit
and
read
the
book
usually
upside
down
and
when
his
sister
wept
he
would
say
Don
t
cry
little
sister
We
are
happy
now
Nietzsche
s
nervous
breakdown
was
caused
in
part
by
the
contumely
of
German
critics
He
was
forced
to
earn
his
living
in
Switzerland
at
Basle
Ma
dame
Foerster-Nietzsche
didn
t
mince
words
when
tell
ing
me
of
the
neglect
and
insults
he
had
been
subjected
to
A
Dane
discovered
him
to
the
world
Georg
Brandes
In
his
autobiography
Ecce
Homo
Nietzsche
says
that
the
Germans
are
the
Chinese
of
Europe
His
own
culture
was
Greek
and
French
And
in
France

The

Poor
persecuted
unhappy
misunderstood
poet
and
philosopher
what
a
shock
it
would
have
been
for
him
to
have
heard
his
name
coupled
with
such
mediocre
pedants
as
Bernhardi
or
Treitschke
he
the
foe
of
militarism
of
tyranny
He
had
never
been
persona-grata
at
Potsdam
Like
Goethe
s
the
genius
of
Nietszche
is
universal
Nearly
twenty-five
years
ago
I
received
from
Tolstoy
a
postcard
on
which
he
wrote
in
English
Sir
I
do
not
like
the
story
of
the
Devil
you
sent
me
I
can
not
see
a
fair
future
for
your
sinister
and
ennobled
talents
Lief
Nicoleivitch
Mobled
Queen

cried
Polonius
But
why
sinister
The
story
was
in
M
lle
New
York
The
letters
I
have
from
Georg
Brandes
are
personal
and
there
is
many
a
gleam
of
humour
and
philosophy
in
them
He
writes
with
equal
fluency
in
four
languages
and
in
each
tongue
not
only
the
precise
idiom
but
the
essential
character
are
present
Alas
the
two-thirds
of
my
writing
all
that
regards
Scandinavian
literature
and
some
other
books
are
not
translated
I
have
even
a
volume
of
verse
to
my
account
And
I
always
try
to
give
my
Danish
style
a
certain
melody
which
is
impossible
to
render
in
translation
You
do
not
know
how
happy
you
are
to
be
read
in
your
own
language
and
to
have
a
language
spread
over
the
earth
My
old
book
on
Russia
was
not
the
cause
that
barred
me
from
Russia
in
1913
I
have
lectured
in
Russia
many
times
since
I
wrote
it
in
1888
But
the
Minister
of
the
In
terior
feared
the
enthusiasm
of
the
young
students
in
Helsingfors
I
have
made
many
attempts
to
help
the
poor
oppressed
Jews
in
Russia
Poland
Finland
but
I
have
always
found
rich
Jews
in
my
way
they
own
the
newspapers
are
in
business
relations
with
the
oppress
ing
government
and
print
nothing
that
would
prove
dis
agreeable
to
it
This
was
written
in
English
from
Copenhagen
dated
July
14
1914
Since
the
war
Brandes
has
had
one
thought
after
his
own
land
France
His
hatred
of
Russia
like
ZangwilFs
is
easily
comprehended
In
despair
he
wrote
me
he
took
up
his
big
book
on
Goethe
begun
twenty-six
years
ago
and
as
we
know
had
the
courage
to
finish
it
In
1909
after
the
publica
tion
of
my
Egoists
he
wrote
from
Copenhagen
congratu
lating
me
though
he
objected
to
the
inclusion
of
the
name
of
Anatole
France
Yet
the
gentle
Anatole
is
an
individualist
notwithstanding
his
socialistic
tendencies
the
general
tone
of
his
writings
gave
me
that
impression
For
Barres
Georg
Brandes
holds
no
brief
of
admiration
He
disliked
his
Dreyfus
activities
naturally
but
how
long
ago
that
seems
He
speaks
with
extreme
cordiality
of
our
former
Minister
at
Copenhagen
Maurice
Egan
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
a
Philadelphian
born
I
never
saw
George
Moore
till
1901
and
then
at

hardly
tell

His
Evelyn
Innes
is
the
best
novel
about
operatic
singers
that
I
know
The
August
afternoon
I
spoke
with
this
remarkable
Irishman
he
wasn
t
aware
that
I
wrote
about
music
My
name
usu
ally
mispronounced
Ah
the
delightful
little
Amy
Hop
pin
who
in
1875
translated
my
long
booming
name
into
French
as
M
Mielcoeur
literally
Honey-Heart
had
not
been
clear
and
when
he
later
wrote
from
Dublin
he
spoke
of
my
Chopin
and
regretted
that
he
hadn
t
known
it
at
the
time
In
a
letter
also
from
Dublin
dated
April
Young
Man
I
give
a
description
of
a
servant-girl
in
a
lodging-house
but
I
did
not
think
of
her
at
the
time
as
a
heroine
of
a
novel
It
was
some
years
after
that
I
con
ceived
the
idea
I
was
walking
down
the
Strand
reading
a
newspaper
It
contained
an
article
on
servants
and
in
the
article
the
following
sentence
occurred
We
often
speak
of
the
trouble
servants
give
us
but
do
we
ever
think
of
the
trouble
we
give
servants
The
sentence
was
illuminating
Of
course
I
said
we
give
servants
a
great
deal
of
trouble
I
wonder
if
a
novel
could
be
written
about
a
servant
A
lady
in
love
with
her
foot
man
No
I
said
that
is
very
common
very
obvious
A
cook
has
a
trade
to
learn
some
one
who
learns
a
trade
a
cook-maid
Now
what
could
happen
to
her
Sooner
or
later
she
would
be
seduced
she
would
have
a
child
she
would
be
sent
away
If
she
did
not
kill
the
child
she
would
have
to
bring
it
up
on
her
wages
Her
wages
would
vary
from
fourteen
to
sixteen
pounds
a
year
on
fourteen
she
could
not
rear
her
child
on
sixteen
she
could
A
human
being
s
life
dependent
on
two
pounds
a
year
These
thoughts
passed
through
my
mind
in
the
space
of
fifty
or
sixty
yards
while
walking
from
Surrey
Street
to
the
Temple
And
the
writing
of
the
book
is
as
unlike
Goncourt
as
anything
could
be
I
had
written
in
Overtones
that
no
doubt
in
a
general
way
Germinie
Lacerteux
suggested
Esther
Waters
but
Mr
Moore
gave
the
genesis
of
that
very
human
story
in
his
letter
He
continued
I
admit
I
was
influenced
by
Zola
in
the
writings
of
my
three
first
books
A
Modern
Lover
A
Mummer
s
Wife
and
A
Drama
in
Muslin
But
Evelyn
Innes
was
not
suggested
by
Huysmans
s
book
it
was
conceived
and
planned
before
Huysmans
s
book
was
printed
Mary
Robertson
the
poetess
Mr
Moore
means
A
Mary
F
Robinson
the
widow
of
Professor
James
Darmesteter
and
later
the
wife
of
Professor
Duclaux
told
me
of
some
little
French
actress
who
had
scruples
of
conscience
about
her
lovers
and
went
into
a
convent
but
she
could
not
remain
there
because
the
nuns
were
so
childish
she
was
three
and
twenty
and
most
of
the
nuns
were
sixty
but
they
seemed
to
her
like
children
What
a
wonder
ful
subject
for
a
novel
I
said
I
must
write
that
I
made
the
actress
a
singer
she
couldn
t
act
in
a
convent
and
as
I
was
under
the
spell
of
Wagner
I
heard
the
story
in
Paris
on
my
return
from
Bayreuth
I
made
her
a
Wagner
singer
Huysmans
writes
of
the
convent
from
the
outside
I
write
of
the
nuns
from
the
inside
There
fe
no
faintest
resemblance
between
me
and
Huysmans
I
have
a
word
to
say
about
the
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
in
which
you
say
From
this
the
reader
will
be
able
to
judge
of
Mr
Moore
s
knowledge
of
music
My
knowledge
of
music
is
the
very
slightest
but
it
was
sufficient
to
save
me
from
the
mistake
which
you
thought
I
fell
into
When
I
wrote
The
last
composer
who
had
distinguished
between
A
sharp
and
B
flat
perhaps
I
should
have
written
The
first
composer
who
ceased
to
distinguish
between
the
two
notes
and
tuned
his
instru
ment
by
semi-tones
and
wrote
forty-eight
Preludes
and
Fugues
My
meaning
would
have
been
clearer
and
I
remember
when
I
saw
the
words
on
the
proof
I
thought
of
altering
them
and
I
m
sorry
I
did
not
as
you
misread
them
I
have
just
returned
from
London
I
went
over
to
hear
the
Elgar
Festival
but
was
so
much
bored
by
Gerontius
that
I
did
not
go
to
hear
The
Apostles
He
seems
to
me
quite
a
commonplace
writer
Some
excitable
ladies
leaned
over
to
ask
me
what
I
thought
of
the
music
during
the
interval
and
I
said
Holy
water
in
a
German
beer
barrel
That
s
a
capital
criticism
In
the
first
edition
of
Evelyn
Innes
he
made
another
witty
epigram
when
he
called
Parsifal

stuffed
Christ
Who
dare
say
that
Mr
Moore
is
not
a
humourist
Not
the
funny
man
in
a
boarding-house
which
he
said
was
Bernard
Shaw
but
a
humourist
whose
humour
permeates
his
writings
through
out
As
to
the
convent
scenes
in
Sister
Teresa
Pearl
Richards
Craigie
John
Oliver
Hobbes
told
me
in
New
York
that
she
had
supplied
Mr
Moore
with
local
colour
She
wrote
a
convent
novel
I
ve
forgotten
its
title
but
I
remember
Sister
Teresa
which
is
a
case
of
fiction
being
stranger
than
truth
A
human
ass
whose
tribe
grows
no
less
said
to
me
many
years
ago
that
the
reason
he
didn
t
like
Dickens
was
because
of
the
novelist
s
predilection
for
low
company
And
someone
it
must
have
been
a
college
professor
that
Eternal
Sophomore
wrote
long
ago
that
George
Moore
preferred
low
company
witness
Esther
Waters
A
Mummer
s
Wife
Mike
Fletcher
by
the
way
his
most
virile
original
per
formance
I
much
prefer
Mike
to
De
Maupassant
s
Bel
Ami
Now
what
sort
of
a
mummy
mind
has
such
a
critic
I
can
quite
understand
people
not
liking
George
Moore
With
Baudelaire
his
books
are
a
touchstone
for
imbeciles
No
man
of
his
time
in
or
out
of
England
has
written
with
such
imaginative
sympathy
in
his
fic
tion
or
with
such
critical
insight
His
versatility
is
re
markable
his
culture
sound
And
what
an
artistic
writer
Vance
Thompson
has
spoken
of
college
profes
sors
with
dandruff
on
their
coat
collars
The
one
I
allude
to
and
I
ve
forgotten
his
name
and
habitat
may
sport
an
immaculate
coat
but
the
dandruff
is
inside
his
skull
John
Quinn
wittily
calls

professors
of
Comparatively
Literature
In
1906
October
26
Mr
Moore
wrote
from
Dublin
You
say
that
Ibsen
s
technique
is
entirely
French
Will
you
allow
me
to
disagree
with
you
on
this
point
No
writer
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
invented
a
technique
so
original
as
Ibsen
s
It
seems
to
me
to
have
fallen
from
the
moon
First
quality
the
omission
of
any
statement
regarding
his
subject-matter
every
other
dramatist
states
his
subject
in
the
first
act
Ibsen
never
in
any
of
the
important
plays
Second
quality
his
man
ner
of
telling
a
story
backwards
Rosmersholm
is
all
told
backwards
and
the
difficulty
of
this
form
is
enor
mous
I
experienced
it
in
the
first
fifty
pages
of
The
Lake
to
write
fifty
pages
in
the
past
participle
is
no
easy
task
and
Ibsen
did
that
in
dialogue
without
anybody
perceiv
ing
that
the
characters
were
asking
and
answering
ques
tions
I
suppose
I
had
said
something
about
Ibsen
s
debt
to
Scribe
in
Iconoclasts
and
he
did
owe
a
lot
on
the
purely
technical
side
As
stage-manager
at
Christiania
or
Bergen
he
adapted
many
plays
from
the
French
reper
toire
Scribe
s
in
particular
Scribe
is
a
wonderful
tech
nician
despite
the
emptiness
of
his
ideas
From
him
you
may
learn
the
playwright
s
trade
But
Ibsen
bene
fited
from
many
sources
Scribe
and
Dumas
fils
among
the
rest
The
Greek
dramatists
have
written
plays
back
wards
There
is
no
new
thing
behind
the
footlights
Ibsen
is
like
a
clear
still
pool
of
icy
water
in
the
ultimate
Scandinavian
pine
forests
a
pool
mirroring
the
sky
and
stars
and
the
stately
shapes
of
tree
also
the
shapes
of
the
men
who
go
to
his
waters
as
on
a
secret
errand
to
dip
their
little
pails
therein
and
later
assert
that
they
had
drawn
from
their
own
private
artesian
wells
Oh
St
Bernard
of
Cork
not
Clairvaux
Like
Brandes
Mr
Moore
is
not
an
admirer
of
Maurice
Barres
He
writes
Barres
is
not
a
great
favourite
of
mine
I
have
always
found
him
very
antipathetic
and
his
literature
always
seemed
to
me
ineffectual
a
well
out
of
which
a
dry
bucket
is
always
coming
up
a
clock
that
never
strikes
the
hour
That
I
do
not
agree
with
this
damning
dictum
is
known
to
readers
of
Egoists
Another
time
he
writes
It
is
extraordinary
how
interesting
you
Americans
make
your
writing
you
never
produce
the
stodgy
mess
that
Englishmen
do
they
write
reviews
that
interest
nobody
Mr
Moore
doesn
t
know
that
over
here
we
smoke
the
opium
of
optimism
He
is
an
avowed
admirer
of
Edgar
Saltus
telling
an
interviewer
that
Poe
Walt
Whitman
and
Edgar
Saltus
were
our
best
writers
Walt
s
superiority
he
maintains
is
because
he
writes
with
his
whole
body
not
alone
with
the
head
I
am
quoting
from
memory
There
are
some
of
us
who
be
lieve
that
W
W
never
used
his
head
at
all
only
his
body
from
the
waist
down
In
1909
I
told
Mr
Moore
that
I
was
contemplating
a
monograph
on
Franz
Liszt
The
news
filled
him
with
enthusiasm
You
know
that
I
am
such
an
egoist
such
a
dog
in
the
manger
that
I
envy
you
that
subject
though
of
course
I
could
not
write
it
myself
To
write
a
life
of
Liszt
must
be
a
charm
ing
thing
to
do
much
better
than
writing
a
life
of
Wagner
Oh
much
He
was
so
many-sided
so
quaint
a
person
ality
his
mistresses
and
his
music
and
his
friendship
with
Wagner
and
a
hundred
other
little
turns
in
his
character
It
is
a
book
I
hope
you
will
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
upon
not
rewriting
it
as
I
write
my
books
for
that
is
madness
Never
do
that
No
I
never
re
write
my
books
The
dog
returns
to
his
vomit
when
an
author
reads
his
proof
That
is
bad
enough
But
I
didn
t
enjoy
writing
my
Liszt
The
subject
required
too
much
research
and
research
requires
time
and
time
is
money
ergo
I
had
to
hurry
the
book
through
in
a
year
Moore
is
a
rich
man
and
he
has
always
had
leisure
which
I
am
happy
to
say
he
never
wasted
Poor
Dostoievsky
the
profoundest
of
the
Russian
novel
ists
and
that
means
the
profoundest
of
all
Balzac
ex
cepted
was
harassed
by
poverty
and
could
not
write
his
powerful
fiction
in
the
artistic
way
he
wished
It
was
a
tragedy
in
the
life
of
a
tragic
soul
Tolstoy
and
Tur
genev
were
rich
Flaubert
till
he
was
fifty
had
ample
means
and
he
had
not
wife
or
children
I
repeat
it
needs
a
competency
to
write
books
My
Liszt
was
not
what
I
had
wished
for
I
dislike
it
but
then
I
dislike
all
my
books
detritus
of
me
as
Whitman
yawps
None
the
less
it
is
a
handy
volume
of
reference
Before
I
finished
it
the
subject
had
ceased
to
interest
me
Liszt
and
the
ladies
There
Mr
Moore
was
clairvoyant
It
is
the
major
motive
in
the
Abbe
s
life
crowded
with
incident
and
the
tragedy
of
being
a
transitional
com
poser
Moore
would
have
handled
the
woman
side
of
Liszt
better
than
I
Mr
Moore
was
excited
when
I
told
him
of
a
rumour
that
The
Lake
was
to
be
dramatised
Why
not
he
asked
and
he
wrote
me
a
long
letter
from
London
dateless
only
105
Marylebone
Road
which
is
prac
tically
a
scenario
of
the
novel
It
is
too
lengthy
to
transcribe
now
He
once
wrote
a
full-fledged
comedy
and
a
very
readable
one
which
I
fetched
to
Daniel
Frohman
Nothing
came
of
it
When
I
last
saw
this
Irishman
of
genius
he
didn
t
look
his
age
by
ten
years
He
was
born
in
1857
The
Marquise
di
Lanza
who
was
born
Clara
Hammond
and
daughter
of
Surgeon
General
Hammond
wrote
me
that
George
Moore
was
born
in
1852
He
told
her
in
1889
that
he
was
then
thirty-seven
Madame
Lanza
still
has
the
letter
Oscar
Wilde
told
her
on
his
visit
to
America
that
he
was
twenty
six
He
was
really
twenty-nine
Not
that
it
matters
A
man
is
as
old
as
he
writes
I
mean
a
writing
man
And
I
ve
noticed
that
men
are
as
vain
and
tetchy
as
women
on
the
subject
of
their
age
Why
not
Cock-a
doodle-doo
crows
the
chanticleer
at
dawn
I
have
related
my
impressions
of
Joseph
Conrad
the
man
His
letters
resemble
him
our
letters
usually
do
re
semble
us
As
is
the
case
with
the
majority
of
great
writers
Mr
Conrad
is
the
most
human
of
humans
His
unfailing
kindness
and
politeness
in
recognising
other
men
s
work
is
very
comforting
to
writers
who
are
swarm
ing
around
the
base
of
his
mountain
I
had
compared
him
with
Flaubert
and
he
wrote
me
1909
that
when
you
overwhelm
me
with
the
mantle
of
Flaubert
it
is
an
ominous
garment
to
put
on
a
man
s
shoulders
Yet
there
is
one
point
in
which
I
resemble
that
great
man
it
is
in
the
desperate
heart-breaking
toil
and
effort
of
the
writing
the
days
of
wrestling
as
with
a
dumb
devil
for
every
line
of
my
creation
Mais
laissons
cela
I
must
go
back
to
my
MS
on
a
page
just
like
this
one
bearing
the
No
890
of
the
novel
I
have
been
at
for
the
last
sixteen
months
And
the
end
is
not
yet
And
that
end
also
does
not
bear
thinking
about
I
believe
that
the
novel
he
mentions
is
Chance
In
another
letter
he
speaks
of
Flaubert
It
was
written
from
Kent
the
same
year
1909
I
too
began
my
communion
with
Flaubert
by
Salammbo
I
might
have
seen
him
but
in
1879
I
was
somewhere
at
sea
au
diable
boulli
Kerguelen
Land
I
think
or
thereabouts
It
was
another
life
I
re
member
with
much
tenderness
as
a
transmigrated
soul
might
be
supposed
by
a
miracle
to
remember
its
previous
envelope
What
is
more
fascinating
than
a
peep
into
the
laboratory
of
a
great
artist
s
mind
Involuntarily
you
exclaim
O
rare
Joseph
Conrad
who
has
wisely
written
that
Imagination
not
invention
is
the
supreme
master
of
art
as
of
life
While
I
was
speaking
of
Nietzsche
I
should
have
quoted
a
striking
remark
made
by
Edith
Wharton
in
a
letter
from
Paris
some
years
ago
1909
She
had
read
his
auto
biography
Ecce
Homo
and
she
found
that
it
held
more
of
the
philosopher
than
any
of
his
other
works
and
she
added
The
farther
I
go
the
more
I
feel
that
Goethe
contained
most
of
him
Nietzsche
and
most
of
every
thing
else
He
was
the
most
Super-est
of
them
all
Mrs
Wharton
could
have
joined
to
Goethe
s
name
that
of
Dostoievsky
I
have
been
rereading
The
Brothers
Karamazov
and
The
Possessed
Englished
by
Constance
Garnett
Besi
is
the
Russian
title
of
The
Possessed
It
means
aptly
enough
Devils
and
my
opinion
is
strength
ened
that
from
the
great
Russian
novelist
Nietzsche
ab
sorbed
much
of
his
mysticism
the
Eternal
Return
the
Superman
In
these
books
also^f
he
Idiot
may
be
found
some
of
the
most
significant
utterances
of
the
German
philosopher
the
most
un-German
thinker
of
his
epoch
In
all
modern
literature
dating
from
Dante
and
I
called
Dostoievsky
the
Dante
of
the
North
in
an
essay
to
be
found
in
Ivory
Apes
and
Peacocks
there
is
no
such
grandiose
vision
as
the
story
of
the
Grand
Inquisitor
in
The
Brothers
Karamazov
When
I
spoke
of
my
Zoo
and
its
queer
inmates
I
was
probably
thinking
of
what
Paul
Elmer
More
wrote
in
power
to
read
all
those
eccentrics
and
maniacs
whom
you
seem
to
know
by
heart
A
week
of
them
would
kill
me
with
ennui
After
all
there
is
nothing
that
really
lasts
and
maintains
its
interest
but
the
sane
and
the
reticent
Words
of
wisdom
But
sane
genius
also
has
its
crazy
wards
its
padded
cells
Dante
Shakespeare
Milton
Goethe
besides
my
maniacs
are
a
pretty
sane
lot
Some
drank
Some
murdered
sleep
yet
Chopin
Stend
hal
Anatole
France
Richard
Strauss
Pater
Wagner
Baudelaire
Manet
Brahms
the
list
is
long
and
far
from
insane
for
I
take
it
neither
Poe
nor
Chopin
were
quite
mad
Drugs
and
alcohol
did
for
Poe
Mad
naked
William
Blake
was
rather
peculiar
to
say
the
least
Yet
a
god-intoxicated
man
No
I
don
t
hold
with
the
eminent
critic
that
is
Mr
Moore
and
I
yield
to
no
one
in
my
admiration
of
Wordsworth
of
the
Lake
School
of
the
placid
and
delightful
eighteenth-century
essayists
A
chacun
son
poison
Richard
Mansfield
I
never
personally
met
but
I
wrote
about
him
critically
from
his
Prince
Karl
days
on
I
have
several
letters
from
him
undated
but
written
dur
ing
the
stress
of
the
Peer
Gynt
production
He
invited
me
to
dine
at
his
home
No
316
Riverside
Drive
and
when
I
gave
my
reason
for
refusing
his
hospitality
also
my
regret
he
fairly
exploded
A
European
born
and
European
in
culture
he
couldn
t
understand
my
attitude
In
London
and
Paris
there
are
clubs
where
actors
artists
writers
and
critics
meet
and
mingle
and
no
harm
comes
of
it
indeed
good
results
But
in
New
York
the
dra
matic
critic
is
taboo
If
he
dines
with
an
actor
or
an
actor
takes
luncheon
with
him
then
the
alarm-bells
are
rung
all
over
town
Mansfield
has
bought
up
Mr
X
I
didn
t
say
this
in
my
letter
but
the
sensitive
Mansfield
understood
He
had
wanted
to
talk
over
Peer
Gynt
with
me
because
he
had
read
what
I
wrote
of
Ibsen
s
tragi-comedy
They
were
then
rehearsing
at
the
New
York
Theatre
and
Will
McConnell
had
instructions
to
admit
me
I
didn
t
go
I
now
regret
it
The
produc
tion
qua
production
was
picturesque
but
the
spirit
of
Ibsen
missing
Mansfield
was
nearing
the
close
of
a
bril
liant
career
He
was
exhausted
by
work
He
had
few
intimate
friends
I
mean
genuine
friends
who
could
advise
him
Edward
A
Dithmar
was
one
but
to
him
Ibsen
was
repugnant
He
was
sincere
in
this
his
dislike
and
I
respected
his
sincerity
Yet
what
an
Ibsen
interpreter
Richard
Mansfield
might
have
been
What
an
Oswald
what
a
Rosmersholm
When
Orlenev
an
extraordinary
Russian
actor
played
here
with
Alia
Nazimova
we
saw
for
the
first
time
the
possibilities
of
the
Master-Builder
Mansfield
was
made
for
the
part
and
for
many
other
modern
roles
But
fate
willed
otherwise
and
he
went
on
year
after
year
wasting
his
dramatic
powers
in
such
tawdry
stuff
as
Parisian
Romance
Dr
Jekyll
and
Mr
Hyde
crude
melodrama
and
the
silly
Prince
Karl
For
Shakespeare
neither
by
temperament
nor
training
was
he
suited
In
Rodion
the
Student
Charles
Henry
Meltzer
s
admirable
adaptation
of
Dos
toievsky
s
The
Crime
and
the
Punishment
Mansfield
was
in
his
element
But
to
his
letter
Here
is
another
grudge
I
have
to
record
against
the
unfortunate
choice
of
a
profession
that
debars
me
from
the
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
brilliant
men
In
this
city
in
this
country
one
is
forced
to
eat
one
s
own
heart
Garrick
and
the
rest
of
them
had
better
luck
they
had
the
stimulus
of
fine
minds
their
opinions
their
encouragement
Still
I
feel
that
we
could
have
discussed
Peer
Gynt
and
I
could
have
got
from
you
a
lot
of
points
that
I
may
miss
even
at
a
sacrifice
to
yourself
and
of
yourself
I
can
t
begin
to
enu
merate
the
essentials
I
should
have
to
talk
it
act
by
act
scene
by
scene
the
necessary
cuts
my
appearance
my
looks
et

Scribners
should
have
published
our

Chicago

probably
d

the
Associated

will
do
the
rest
As
to
Anitra
a
character
in
the
play
being
the
Eternal
Womanly
I
have
my
doubts
We
have
Solveig
the
one
is
no
more
eternal
than
the
other
or
the
other
than
the
one
on
earth
if
it
had
not
been
for
Solveig
I
should
not
have
undertaken
to
do
Peer
but
of
course
the
much
esteemed
author
I
know
only
meant
that
the
Eternal
Womanly
all
of
them
write
these
days
I
shall
not
allow
the
dread
passenger
to
refer
to
midmost
of
Act
V
because
that
is
one
of
Ibsen
s
mistakes
in
good
taste
It
is
hard
enough
to
drag
the
people
off
the
earth
without
knocking
them
back
to
it
of
a
sudden
and
reminding
them
that
after
all
we
are
in
a
theatre
and
only
actor-folk
But
Lord
I
could
write
on
forever
Throw
it
in
your
waste-basket
and
let
it
go
at
that
Don
t
write
about
it
and
me
but
come
and
talk
to
me
the
public
would
be
the
loser
but
I
shall
be
the
gainer
and
perhaps
in
the
end
the
public
too
This
letter
shows
what
Mansfield
s
friends
knew
that
the
actor
was
not
only
a
charming
man
but
amenable
to
reason
He
was
often
caricatured
by
irresponsible
writers
The
biography
by
Paul
Wilstach
demonstrates
that
It
was
my
loss
not
meeting
the
gifted
and
musical
man
And
what
a
lot
he
did
for
Shaw
for
he
literally
gave
Arms
and
the
Man
and
The
Devil
s
Disciple
their
first
artistic
production
in
America
Mr
Shaw
was
charac
teristically
grateful
judging
from
the
letters
that
passed
between
actor
and
author
But
could
Peer
Gynt
have
been
possible
here
I
saw
it
in
its
entirety
somewhere
in
Europe
and
it
took
two
nights
to
play
it
A

Bellew
speaks
of
Mrs
Pat
Campbell
She
is
the

the
real

not
there
She
must
be
written
around
It
is
the
skittishness
of
her
personality
that
has
set
London

s
memorable
impersonation
of

As
an

she
is
impossible
as
a
producer
of
a
certain
kind
of
suggestion
she
is
immense
She
will
never
be
a

She
is
Pat

A
single
letter
from
the
beautiful
Mary
F
Scott-Siddons
is
dated
from
Berlin
February
1896
and
chiefly
deals
with
the
troubles
she
was
undergoing
in
producing
an
opera
composed
by
her
protege
the
English
pianist
and
pupil
of
Liszt
Henry
Waller
Fra
Francesco
was
its
title
and
Arthur
Sullivan
had
approved
of
the
music
I
dimly
remember
that
it
was
given
in
Germany
But
by
far
the
most
in
teresting
part
of
the
letter
is
the
account
of
her
Shake
spearean
reading
before
the
Kaiser
and

at

Oddly
enough

American

My
correspondence
with
Remy
de
Gourmont
covered
several
decades
It
is
chiefly
literary
and
there
is
so
much
in
it
about
my
books
that
my
well-known
modesty
estops
me
from
reproducing
these
letters
Senator
Lodge
made
a
happy
quotation
at
the
close
of
a
certain
letter
I
look
with
amazement
at
the
flood
of
books
that
I
see
pouring
over
the
news-stands
and
counters
It
is
not
that
they
are
meretricious
or
immoral
but
they
seem
to
me
so
feeble
and
so
full
of
weak
sentiment
I
think
constantly
when
I
look
upon
them
of
Carlyle
s
phrase
that
they
are
intended
for
immediate
use
and
immediate
oblivion
Your
George
Sand
in
Unicorns
brought
back
distant
memories
She
was
still
a
con
spicuous
figure
still
writing
when
I
was
a
boy
and
a
young
man
She
had
a
great
reputation
then
I
remember
that
I
tried
to
read
her
books
and
they
bored
me
it
seems
to
me
as
if
the
years
in
their
movement
had
justified
my
original
attitude
On
the
other
hand
she
has
as
you
say
immense
interest
as
a
personality
Of
the
so-called
and
still-unborn
Great

Novel
William
Dean
Howells
wrote
We
all
have
to
have
our
shy
at
that
monstrous
misconception
that
grotesque
impossibility
and
I
like
to
see
you
bang
it
about
But
we
shall
never
bang
it
out
of
the
heads
that
have
so
little
in
them
One
of
my
treasured
letters
is
dated
May
8
1902
and
signed
Frank
Norris
Well
I
remember
his
earnestness
when
he
asserted
that
poor
or
mediocre
books
were
for
the
mass
of
the
people
better
than
none
at
all
Only
get
them
to
read
anything
was
his
plea
Of
my
Melomaniacs
he
wrote
some
words
that
pleased
me
for
Norris
was
a
craftsman
You
cer
tainly
have
attained
what
has
always
seemed
to
me
the
most
difficult
of
all
achievements
I
mean
originality
without
grotesqueness
I
was
tickled
to
death
over
that
You
see
even
professional
critics
have
feelings
It
was
as
long
ago
as
1893
that
I
began
corresponding
with
Israel
Zangwill
for
whose
work
I
have
genuine
es
teem
When
he
visited
the
United
States
in
1898
I
met
him
in
New
York
I
had
imitated
him
in
such
stories
as
The
Shofar
Blew
at
Sunset
and
in
The
Cardinal
s
Fiddle
and
he
was
duly
amused
Like
most
Englishmen
he
can
t
understand
that
I
am
tired
of
Whitmania
probably
as
Lawrence
Gilman
sug
gested
because
I
had
suffered
from
a
bad
attack
in
my
youth
and
had
recovered
What
I
chiefly
resent
is
the
implication
that
Whitman
voices
our
national
feeling
or
even
pictures
us
as
we
are
He
does
neither
We
are
not
Camerados
closely
knit
as
the
war
has
made
us
Mr
Zangwill
finds
in
him
the
real
insight
of
a
seer
Granted
And
still
one
swallow
doesn
t
make
a
summer
These
States
as
John
Jay
Chapman
pointed
out
years
ago
are
not
peopled
by
Walt
Whitman
characters
The
Lord
forbid
Max
Nordau
for
example
doesn
t
agree
with
Mr
Zangwill
in
his
estimate
of
Walt
calling
him
a
rotten
sensualist
as
may
be
noted
in
the
Calamus
section
of
Leaves
of
Grass
and
of
patriotic
yawps
he
has
this
to
say
In
his
patriotic
poems
Whitman
is
a
sycophant
of
the
corrupt
American
vote-buying
official
bribing
power-abusing
dollar-democracy
and
a
cringer
to
the
most
arrogant
Yankee
conceit

How
Max
admires
us
John
LaFarge
the
critic
interested
me
more
than
John
LaFarge
the
painter
He
is
called
an
eclectic
which
simply
means
an
artist
who
lacks
originality
His
pictures
never
attracted
me
not
even
the
South
Sea
examples
Paul
Gauguin
not
LaFarge
is
my
man
for
exotic
art
But
an
extraordinary
raconteur
was
the
American
according
to
Royal
Cortissoz
I
never
met
him
although
I
went
to
his
Tenth
Street
studio
to
see
his
stained
glass
which
I
liked
I
have
a
stack
of
letters
from
him
They
are
of
equal
interest
I
quote
a
few
sente
ices
showing
the
curiosity
of
the
thinker
concern
ing
art
and
life
In
1907
he
writes
I
want
to
tell
you
what
always
interests
me
because
I
can
not
tell
myself
how
it
is
done
though
it
is
very
well
known
that
is
how
a
painter
can
carry
out
the
enormous
mass
of
detail
of
a
painting
from
Nature
in
the
few
minutes
that
make
an
hour
or
two
or
three
hours
Several
of
the
pictures
you
mention
the
water
colours
in
the
South
Seas
are
only
a
couple
of
hours
work
and
the
big
one
which
you
may
remember
is
an
afternoon
s
work
You
your
self
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
ought
to
go
down
and
live
in
those
wonders
of
light
and
air
But
what
I
wished
to
write
to
you
about
was
your
paper
on
the
etchings
of
Rembrandt
and
Whistler
it
appeared
in
The
Sun
What
you
have
said
is
to
my
mind
very
much
needed
Some
excellent
people
confuse
the
limit
of
things
and
in
their
enthusiastic
admiration
for
Whistler
put
him
where
it
is
unjust
to
be
I
have
never
been
exactly
a
Stendhalist
I
had
quoted
Stendhal
but
I
remem
ber
Henry
James
who
himself
of
course
admired
him
more
or
less
was
interesting
in
his
expression
of
dislike
when
we
were
in
Italy
together
In
Paris
some
fifty
odd
years
ago
I
met
people
who
had
known
Stendhal
Beyle
You
may
remember
that
my
grand-uncle
Paul
de
Saint
Victor
was
a
successful
rival
in
some
one
of
the
love
affairs
of
your
man
John
LaFarge
was
one
of
the
first
American
artists
who
went
in
for
the
Japanese
for
Blake
for
Goya
His
mural
composi
tions
are
pasticcios
W
B
Yeats
wrote
me
in
1903
that
John
Quinn
had
told
him
I
wrote
the
article
in
The
Sun
on
the
Irish
movement
in
two
hours
which
was
true
Yeats
adds
That
seems
to
me
a
wonderful
feat
for
it
is
precisely
what
journalism
is
not
detailed
and
philosophical
and
accurate
Of
course
my
critic
in
The
Evening
Post
was
right
in
one
sense
in
calling
me
decadent
We
are
all
decadent
our
sins
are
the
sins
of
our
forefathers
But
I
am
struggling
against
it
always
trying
to
get
the
fire
to
the
centre
not
to
the
circumference
I
don
t
think
this
critic
knew
that
Lionel
Johnson
who
is
his
type
of
classic
health
never
got
up
till
dark
or
went
to
bed
till
daylight
wrote
poems
to
absinthe
and
died
poor
man
of
a
fall
he
got
when
intoxicated
Of
course
this
isn
t
the
same
thing
as
literary
decadence
but
I
imagine
it
would
have
seemed
so
to
him
I
have
a
notion
that
everybody
has
been
decadent
since
Shakespeare
and
the
reason
for
it
is
partly
a
question
of
language
but
that
is
too
big
a
question
for
a
letter
Mr
Yeats
might
have
recommended
his
critic
all
critics
to
read
the
masterly
exposition
on
the
theme
of
decadence
in
Affirmations
by
Havelock
Ellis
After
the
Nordau
humbuggery
the
word
decadence
was
used
as
a
club
to
smash
an
author
s
reputation
Nowadays
it
s
a
joke
for
Washington
Square
Bohemia
Paul
Hervieu
is
another
writer
with
whom
I
came
in
contact
at
Paris
His
dramas
are
still
in
the
repertory
of
the
Theatre
Frangais
Les
Tenailles
Nippers
Le
Reveil
with
Julia
Bartet
Bargy
and
Paul
Mgunet-SuIIy
the
brother
of
the
tragedian
and
The
Enigma
These
pieces
were
poorly
interpreted
in
New
York
The
Awakening
with
Olga
Nethersole
hardly
a
substitute
for
Julia
Bartet
whose
exquisite
art
is
for
me
an
exquisite
memory
I
spent
a
pleasant
hour
with
M
Hervieu
at
his
apartment
on
the
Avenue
du
Bois
de
Boulogne
No
23
He
was
a
reserved
man
with
an
Eng
lish
bearing
which
I
set
down
to
his
fondness
for
things
English
he
informed
me
that
he
spent
his
summers
on
the
Isle
of
Wight
He
impressed
me
as
a
man
suffering
from
secret
chagrin
perhaps
an
unhappy
love-affair
His
artistic
successes
were
numerous
I
was
all
the
more
surprised
when
he
advised
me
not
to
give
way
to
cyni
cism
irony
he
detested
he
the
skinner
of
souls
whose
surgeon
s
scalpel
was
deeply
dipped
in
irony
he
the
novelist
whose
use
of
the
so-called
cruel
terms
was
as
disconcerting
as
Henri
Becque
s
Doubtless
because
of
his
abuse
of
verbal
corrosive-sublimate
he
sought
to
restrain
younger
men
from
his
mistake
His
letters
a
dozen
are
full
of
technical
gossip
about
his
plays
The
tall
slanting
handwriting
of
Alia
Nazimova
recalls
the
time
when
she
made
her
debut
here
in
company
with
Orlenev
at
a
little
theatre
off
the
Bowery
East
Third
or
Fourth
Streets
Emma
Goldman
was
the
press-agent
and
called
herself
Emma
Smith
on
account
of
her
numer
ous
tiffs
with
the
police
I
can
go
back
still
further
to
the
days
when
Emma
was
a
disciple
of
Johann
Most
the
anarchist
It
was
not
the
law
that
ended
Johann
s
days
but
John
Barleycorn
He
was
a
thirsty
dreamer
Nazi
mova
afterwards
played
Grushenka
wonderfully
in
a
dramatisation
of
The
Brothers
Karamazov
at
the
Lex
ington
Avenue
Theatre
near
Forty-second
Street
Or
lenev
was
the
Dmitri
a
half-crazy
drunkard
falsely
ac
cused
of
parricide
The
company
generally
was
excellent
the
intellectual
aristocracy
of
the
town
present
Miss
Nazimova
s
career
since
then
has
been
confined
to
the
English-speaking
stage
But
she
was
at
her
artistic
best
when
playing
in
Russian
A
note
that
I
received
from
William
M
Laffan
then
proprietor
of
The
Sun
1907
exhibits
his
native
decision
and
Celtic
humour
Yes
sir
I
am
or
more
rightly
I
was
an
etcher
and
none
of
your
damned
amateurs
either
I
want
you
to
understand
Twenty
five
years
ago
I
converted
sheets
of
otherwise
blameless
copper
into
bread
and
butter
I
don
t
know
how
many
I
did
but
I
don
t
mind
telling
you
that
the
art
of
them
was
on
a
high
plane
a
very
high
plane
indeed
a
fact
which
is
not
necessarily
impugned
by
my
having
been
able
to
sell
them
There
is
nowhere
thank
God
a
proof
extant
I
think
I
possess
only
one
so
that
I
may
say
what
I
like
about
their
quality
and
run
no
measurable
danger
The
bad
proofs
that
a
man
pulls
will
always
come
home
to
rocst
but
I
am
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
I
will
read
your
article
about
Rops
with
pleasure
Why
not
have
a
go
at
Meryon
There
s
provocation
for
you
I
did
The
study
appeared
on
the
editorial
page
of
The
Sun
and
later
was
included
in
Promenades
of
an
Impressionist
William
Laffan
was
too
modest
I
have
seen
a
woodcut
of
his
representing
a
covey
of
birds
which
betrayed
observation
and
knowledge
of
technical
process
His
handwriting
is
etched
With
the
excep
tion
of
W
C
Brownell
s
pen-and-ink
miniatures
I
never
saw
such
tiny
lettering
allied
with
such
diamond
clear
ness
Pearl
Mary-Teresa
Craigie
as
she
signed
herself
was
not
in
private
life
like
her
masculine
pen-name
John
Oliver
Hobbes
She
was
shy
feminine
sympa
thetic
I
only
saw
her
once
and
at
the
Hotel
Nether
lands
She
spoke
of
her
favourite
writers
of
George
Moore
and
Bernard
Shaw
evidently
not
her
favourites
and
she
confessed
to
being
an
anti-Wagnerian
Her
handwriting
too
in
the
half-dozen
letters
I
have
saved
is
small
and
clear
Another
human
being
who
made
me
unhappy
in
her
presence
because
of
her
inquietude
Her
last
communication
is
dated
April
24
1906
and
was
written
at
her
home
Steephill
Castle
Ventnor
Isle
of
Wight
In
reading
some
of
the
letters
Havelock
Ellis
sent
me
during
the
past
fifteen
years
I
note
the
same
quality
of
charm
and
wisdom
that
informs
his
published
writings
Now
to
write
a
book
that
is
both
wise
and
charming
seems
a
task
beyond
the
powers
of
most
of
our
young
authors
They
are
in
such
a
hurry
tumbling
head
over
heels
to
court
the
favours
of
the
Great
God
Success
that
they
give
us
hardly
the
bare
ribs
of
literature
Charm
isn
t
it
a
lost
art
And
haste
and
charm
are
mutually
exclusive
You
can
t
be
charming
on
a
type
writing
machine
Worst
of
all
few
miss
the
quality
The
reading
public
takes
its
literature
dished
up
with
advertisements
and
only
asks
that
the
story
be
told
with
cinematographic
velocity
To
concentrate
one
s
intelligence
on
a
phrase
is
inconceivable
to
linger
over
an
idea
or
a
prose
cadence
that
way
folly
flies
Hurrah
for
the
Movies
in
print
Yet
there
are
some
serene
souls
left
with
brains
and
art
to
interpret
them
a
few
who
refuse
to
mingle
with
the
vast
mob
of
tripe-sellers
in
the
market-place
One
of
these
elect
is
Havelock
Ellis
known
as
a
psychologist
nevertheless
a
literary
critic
of
singular
charm
and
acuteness
His
New
Spirit
made
a
sensation
twenty-five
years
ago
Affirmations
was
another
revealing
book
with
its
studies
of
such
disparate
per
sonalities
as
Zola
St
Francis
Casanova
Nietzsche
The
note
of
catholicity
sounds
throughout
the
fluid
prose
of
this
master

Recall
The
Soul
of
Spain
the
most
sympathetic
book
on
modern
Spanish
art
and

that
I
have
read
Velasquez
and
Goya
are
not
overlooked
His
Impressions
and
Comments
is
charged
with
kindly
wisdom
garnered
from
a
life
rich
in
experi
ence
and
thought
not
more
than
a
page
or
two
in
length
on
a
thousand-and-one
themes
saturated
with
the
toler
ant
Ellis
philosophy
which
he
once
defined
as
the
diffi
cult
art
of
holding
on
and
letting
go
But
I
must
brisk
up
my
tempo
else
I

be

A
Homeric
catalogue
of
names
would
be
the
quickest
way
to
dispose
of
my
letters
There
is
a
hastily
written
scrawl
from
the
English
painter
Augustus
John
whose
canvases
are
among
the
jewels
of
the
John
Quinn
collection
There
are
letters
galore
from
that
witty
and
erudite
New
York
barrister
who
the
older
he
grows
looks
more
like
Cardinal
Man
ning
Quinn
the
avowed
friend
of
the
Irish
literary
movement
of
Synge
and
Moore
Yeats
Stephens
James
Joyce
Lady
Gregory
and
also
a
friend
of
Arthur
Symons
and
Joseph
Conrad
He
is
not
so
ascetic
as
he
looks
but
a
letter-writer
born
The
name
of
Jules
Gaultier
is
at
the
bottom
of
a
finely
written
page
Of
this
brilliant
philosopher
I
wrote
years
ago
I
even
introduced
his
books
to
William
James
but
the
American
thinker
was
just
then
absorbed
in
Henri
Bergson
and
Pragma
tism
and
he
never
expressed
an
opinion
of
Gaultier
for
me
the
superior
thinker
of
the
pair
above
all
one
with
out
a
trace
of
sentimental
charlatanism
You
can
t
say
the
same
of
Bergson
that
weaver
of
glittering
specious
phrases
In
his
letter
Gaultier
deplores
the
death
of
Remy
de
Gourmont
That
writer
did
much
to
spread
the
ideas
of
Jules
Gaultier
As
I
have
told
you
my
friendship
with
Maurice
Maeterlinck
dates
back
to
1903
His
letters
are
personal
I
have
only
one
letter
from
James
Joyce
a
man
of
genius
His
play
Exiles
has
the
same
poignant
quality
we
find
in
The
Master
Builder
or
in
some
of
Strindberg
s
one-act
dramas
The
same
intensity
oppressiveness
and
lurking
tragic
terror
I
couldn
t
help
thinking
of
Strindberg
s
Credi
tors
but
Joyce
is
individual
and
Celtic
to
the
back
bone
A
bitter
brew
but
stimulating
is
his
play
saying
pleasant
things
about
my
study
of
Stendhal
in
Egoists
M
Bourget
it
was
who
revived
the
cult
of
Stendhal
in
the
early
eighties
of
the
past
century
and
so
timed
that
he
fulfilled
the
great
writer
s
prediction
that
he
would
be
understood
about
1880
Bourget
is
not
much
read
by
the
present
generation
in
America
though
he
was
popular
when
The
Disciple
and
Cruel
Enigma
were

Villa
Tanit
Antibes
She
thanks
me
for
the
Flaubert
study
in
Egoists
Madame
Grout
was
formerly
Carolina
Commainville
the
favourite
niece
of
Gustave
Flaubert
who
supposedly
egotist
gave
up
his
personal
fortune
when
the
husband
of
his
niece
became
embarrassed
in
business
As
you
already
know
I
am
an
enraged
Flau
bertian
and
have
been
spreading
his
gospel
for
thirty
years
The
very
name
of
her
villa
Tanit
has
a
touch
of
Salammbo
Her
second
husband
Dr
Grout
was
one
of
the
physicians
at
the
private
sanatorium
of
Dr
Blanche
where
unfortunate
Guy
de
Maupassant
was
confined
and
died
Henry
Labouchere
wrote
in
London
Truth
at
the
time
of
De
Maupassant
s
death
that
Guy
was
a
natural
son
of
Flaubert
s
and
that
he
told
his
own
story
in
his
best
novel
Pierre
et
Jean
best
after
Une
vie
There
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
to
support
this
romantic
yarn
Flaubert
formed
the
talents
of
his
pupil
Guy
a
mere
child
in
comparison
with
his
mighty
master
and
one
who
was
grateful
enough
to
testify
to
that
fact
a
fact
sometimes
overlooked
by
young
writers
who
prefer
his
elaborately
carved
cherry-stones
to
the
Mas
sive
figures
chiselled
from
the
solid
marble
My

Madame
Bovary
one
of
the
glories
of
French
literature
as
Henry
James
has
said
in
a
moment
of
unusual
expansion
he
alternately
admired
and
disliked
Flaubert
in
the
making
I
re
produced
one
of
these
pages
in
Egoists
I
also
possess
a
letter
of
the
Master
probably
addressed
to
his
lady

Louise
Colet
the
woman
whose

was

Here

MID-VICTORIAN
MAX
I
never
believed
in
criticising
a
criticism
i
e
9
a
criticism
concerning
myself
That
way
lies
confusion
of
spirit
besides
it
s
a
waste
of
time
Because
a
critic
doesn
t
like
your
work
and
says
so
he
is
not
necessarily
in
the
wrong
He
is
often
right
I
mention
this
as
a
mild
preparation
to
the
pleasing
story
of
a
verbal
war
fare
indulged
in
once
upon
a
time
by
Mr
Shaw
and
Mr
Huneker
No
blood
was
spilt
no
bones
were
broken
Our
native
bad
tempers
only
peeped
out
at
intervals
as
the
Colonel
would
say
we
had
a
bully
time
But
first
I
must
begin
with
Max
Beerbohm
whose
too
few
books
have
been
a
source
of
joy
to
me
as
they
are
to
lovers
of
prose
as
palatable
as
dry
sherry
In
Unicorns
I
ranked
Mr
Beerbohm
with
the
stylists
who
produce
slowly
and
with
infinite
pains
an
astringent
liqueur
for
connoisseurs
Precious
Yes
at
times
but
as
irony
is
his
happiest
medium
his
form
and
utterance
are
condi
tioned
by
it
Max
is
a
born
classic
as
readers
of
the
delightful
Works
and
Zuleika
Dobson
need
not
be
told
Well
in
1903
on
the
appearance
of
my
Iconoclasts
which
had
a
fair
measure
of
critical
and
public
success
in
London
Mr
G
K
Chesterton
wrote
appreciatively
of
the
book
a
copy
fell
into
the
hands
of
Mr
Beerbohm
then
writing
for
The
Saturday
Review
Result
one
of
the
old-fashioned
critical
scarifications
My
unfortunate
group
of
Iconoclasts
were
bowled
over
by
a
pen
so
often
languid
and
affected
but
become
vigorous
ferocious
possibly
because
I
was
a
Yankee
It
was
a
page
of
bril
liant
destructive
criticism
It
did
the
book
much
good
as
far
as
sales
were
concerned
adverse
criticism
is
better
than
none
and
Bernard
Shaw
wrote
me
a
letter
con
gratulating
me
on
the
honour
of
being
slashed
in
The
Saturday
I
didn
t
precisely
see
the
honour
though
I
understood
the
kindly
interest
displayed
by
Max
Over
here
the
review
attracted
the
attention
and
the
late
Harry
Thurston
Peck
tried
to
sic
me
on
the
English
critic
He
said
that
the
Beerbohm
style
was
constipated
mine
copious
therefore
we
must
be
antipathetic
to
one
another
This
reasoning
did
not
appeal
to
me
and
I
refused
to
be
drawn
into
controversy
Two
exceptions
I
did
take
to
the
article
mentally
of
course
and
without
impugning
the
general
conclusions
of
the
writer
One
was
being
called
a
yellow
journalist
when
everyone
knew
that
my
colour
was
purple
I
wrote
purple
panels
then
or
tried
to
the
other
exception
was
being
described
as
writing
like
a
drunken
helot
That
struck
me
as
a
contradiction
for
helots
drunk
or
sober
did
not
write
at
all
not
even
on
the
tablets
of
their
memory
However
that
is
a
mere
scratch
and
I
did
not
explain
it
to
Mr
Beerbohm
knowing
how
busy
he
was
at
the
moment
demonstrating
to
his
cockney
read
ers
what
a
great
dramatist
Mr
Shaw
was
infinitely
greater
than
Arthur
Pinero
As
for
the
demerits
of
Iconoclasts
I
have
naught
to
say
except
that
it
has
sold
better
than
any
of
my
books
possibly
an
ominous
sign
in
the
eyes
of
Mr
Beerbohm
who
has
no
doubt
forgotten
all
about
his
clever
review
That
other
critics
did
not
agree
with
his
verdict
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
notably
Remy
de
Gourmont
who
also
gave
me
the
opening
review
in
the
Mercure
de
France
a
long
article
on
Chopin
now
included
in
a
volume
of
his
Epilogues
That
absence
of
tendenz
which
William
James
complained
about
in
my
Egoists
a
refusal
on
my
part
to
indulge
in
so-called
general
views
in
any
neat
little
theory
or
problem
met
the
approval
of
Remy
de
Gourmont
who
detested
phrases
and
empty
formulas

am
speaking
now
of
Icono

We

of
Mr

Nevertheless
I
did
not
write
a

as
suggested
by
the
French
critic
I
preferred

I
am

busy

to

for

I
proposed
to
Brentanos
that
they
should
get
you
to
edit
a
selection
from
my
musical
feuilletons
in
The
World
etc
They
said
it
was
an
excellent
idea
to
get
you
to
edit
my
dramatic
feuilletons
and
that
they
had
bought
up
the
old

of

Knock

last

G
Bernard
Shaw
The
peasant
lad
I
shall
presently
deal
with
of
the
Dramatic
Opinions
I
would
speak
first
The
late
Volney
Streamer
literary
adviser
of
the
Brentanos
had
collected
all
the
critical
articles
of
Mr
Shaw
from
The
Saturday
I
was
asked
to
write
a
Prelude
to
the
book
which
con
tains
some
of
the
author
s
always
engaging
and
often
fallacious
criticisms
In
my
preface
or
introduction
rather
impertinence
I
happened
to
speak
of
Mr
Beer
bohm
as
Mid
Victorian
Max
If
I
had
tried
to
be
funny
and
had
written
Mud-Victorian
for
London
was
clogged
with
literary
mud
during
the
Yellow
Book
period
of
the
nineties
or
even
Max
Victorian
I
might
have
understood
what
followed
in
the
pages
of
The
Saturday
Max
went
up
into
the
air
Another
page
of
loving
invectives
followed
worse
than
the
first
review
and
I
began
to
feel
famous
He
informed
his
readers
that
he
was
proud
of
the
ascription
Mid
Vic
torian
If
he
were
why
so
hot
little
man
as
Emerson
asked
If
I
wrote
the
precise
phrase
that
pleased
him
why
should
he
foam
at
the
mouth
metaphorically
speak
ing
In
classic
parlance
I
got
his
goat
and
also
a
lot
of
free
advertising
That
was
better
than
my
publicly
objecting
to
his
purple
helot
wasn
t
it
I
suspect
that
Mr
Shaw
was
not
overjoyed
with
my
preface
as
later
he
wrote
one
for
the
English
edition
The
pro
jected
collection
of
his
musical
criticisms
did
not
appear
a
good
thing
as
Shaw
whether
writing
of
pictures
or
the
tone-art
is
distinctly
amateurish
Glittering
generali
ties
are
his
but
not
backed
up
by
technical
training
wide
experience
or
genuine
musical
temperament
John
Run
ciman
told
me
that
he
had
a
poor
opinion
of
Shaw
as
a
music-critic
The
peasant
boy
caused
all
the
trouble
and
al
though
I
tried
to
explain
to
Mr
Shaw
that
the
head-line
in
Success
Magazine
was
none
of
my
making
he
would
not
listen
to
me
Robert
Mackey
then
associate
editor
of
Success
wrote
that
head-line
and
he
has
since
deplored
doing
so
However
his
sorrow
is
about
as
deep
as
mine
Why
should
Mr
Shaw
heartily
dislike
the
peasant
Scratch
a
socialist
and
you
come
on
a
snob
Max
Beer
bohm
has
said
in
effect
that
socialism
will
never
succeed
till
snobbishness
ceases
He
is
right
Mr
Shaw
is
not
of
peasant
origin
though
he
has
written
that
most
Irish
men
originally
came
over
from
Liverpool
on
cattle-boats
he
is
middle-class
Cork
with
a
Cork
soul
and
his
family
was
not
rich
He
was
a
poor
youth
when
he
went
to
London
and
he
is
none
the
worse
for
his
struggle
The
newspapers
created
the
Shaw
legend
that
he
was
a
vegetarian
a
teetotaler
anti-vaccine
anti-vivisection
anti-evening
clothes
wearing
Jaeger
flannels
anti-every
thing
except
notoriety
Yet
for
repeating
in
my
article
what
was
common
talk
thanks
to
his
own
self-propa
ganda
St
George
who
has
slain
so
many
dragons
fell
foul
of
me
in
a
certain
letter
calling
me
the
short
ugly
word
on
every
count
G
B
S
My
main
offence
however
was
the
peasant
lad
that
rankled
I
met
his
cousin
Robert
Shaw
a
news
paper
correspondent
for
the
New
York
Sun
and
some
London
journals
in
Berlin
He
had
not
seen
Success
and
I
suspect
Mr
Shaw
s
sister
did
not
see
it
then
The
foolish
part
of
the
affair
was
that
Mr
Shaw
didn
t
believe
my
story
of
the
mistake
he
fancied
a
lurking
insult
when
none
was
intended
indeed
I
could
only
plead
ignorance
of
another
s
error
So
when
he
wrote
me
August
1905
My
dear
Huneker
You
really
must
come
over
here
and
have
your
mind
properly
trained
you
will
never
be
anything
but
a
clever
slummocker
in
America
I
knew
that
further
argument
was
useless
And
who
was
I
to
succeed
where
the
only
Shaw
had
so
signally
failed
I
wrote
a
weekly
column
for
years
in
the
London
Musical
Courier
I
had
lived
in
London
and
I
loved
the
city
not
evidently
to
no
purpose
for
if
thirty
years
residence
couldn
t
change
Shaw
from
being
a
clever
Irish
slummocker
what
chance
had
I
for
spiritual
redemption
I
remained
in
America
the
America
that
first
recognised
him
thanks
to
Richard
Mansfield
I
was
the
first
to
write
of
him
as
early
as
1888
In
of
Shaw
s
for
The
Musical
Courier
which
he
did
It
was
printed
in
June
or
July
of
that
year
though
I
shan
t
swear
as
to
the
year
as
I
have
not
kept
my
files
of
that
journal
it
may
have
been
1891
But
it
was
the
first
musical
story
by
Bernard
Shaw
to
appear
in
an
Ameri
can
publication
What
was
it
about
If
I
remember
it
preached
the
superiority
of
the
forerunners
of
the
pianoforte
over
the
modern
instrument
I
have
often
noticed
with
amusement
that
literary
persons
usually
like
tinkling
music
They
speak
of
dulcimers
harpsi
chords
clavichords
they
prate
of
cymbaloms
harps
and
lutes
but
for
full-blooded
highly-coloured
composi
tions
for
the
keyboard
whether
by
Bach
or
Beethoven
or
Chopin
they
have
an
abhorrence
The
subdued
light
of
Chinese
lanterns
the
Bohemian
studio
atmos
phere
the
tinkle-tinkle
of
music
made
by
young
men
wearing
bangles
Ah
that
is
lofty
art
George
Moore
in
Evelyn
Innes
goes
into
the
matter
heart
and
soul
So
did
Shaw
and
recently
I
read
in
Ezra
Pound
s
Pavan
nes
and
Divisions
a
fresh
eulogy
of
Arnold
Dolmetsch
and
his
old
instruments
We
had
Dolmetsch
over
here
many
years
ago
He
is
all
right
so
is
the
antique
and
charming
music
he
plays
but
when
Shaw
begins
abusing
the
modern
concert
grand
pianoforte
I
can
t
help
re
calling
his
other
article
amusing
enough
in
an
English
monthly
or
fortnightly
in
which
he
tells
how
he
studied
the
piano
He
unblushingly
gives
his
reason
for
mildly
abusing
me
which
reason
corroborates
my
claim
as
being
his
discoverer
over
here
Under
date
i6th
September
and
heap
insults
on
you
is
that
you
are
very
useful
to
me
in
America
and
quite
friendly
consequently
you
must
be
educated
or
you
will
compromise
me
The
blind
leading
the
blind
I
don
t
think
his
allusion
to
my
usefulness
cynical
What
else
is
a
critic
good
for
but
to
make
himself
useful
What
is
still
more
amusing
was
his
communication
on
music
in
a
letter
dated
I3th
August
1905
from
Cork
It
is
like
the
others
in
his
small
distinct
handwriting
Some
day
I
shall
talk
to
you
about
music
I
haven
t
the
time
to
write
now
Last
winter
I
heard
Liszt
s
Faust
symphony
played
for
the
first
time
in
London
old-fashioned
before
it
was
born
an
obsession
with
the
new
chords
of
the
fifties
We
had
been
listening
in
New
York
to
the
Faust
sym
phony
for
how
many
years
How
shallow
is
Shaw
s
judgment
may
be
noted
in
his
neglect
to
study
Liszt
in
a
proper
historical
perspective
The
chords
of
the
fifties
were
Liszt
s
original
harmonic
inventions
not
to
speak
of
his
themes
some
of
which
were
utilised
by
Wagner
in
The
Ring
Tristan
and
Parsifal
I
ll
go
further
Without
Liszt
Parsifal
would
not
be
as
it
is
Liszt
contributed
much
to
the
mystic
atmos
phere
So
much
for
George
the
clever
musical
slum
mocker
He
continues
I
know
a
lot
more
than
you
do
especially
about
music
What
I
said
about
Liszt
s
music
is
exactly
accurate
Go
and
study
the
operas
of
Cornelius
delightful
music
if
you
want
to
understand
that
particular
moment
But
George
dear
old
son
It
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
study
the
music
of
Peter
Cornelius
as
I
had
listened
to
his
masterpiece
season
after
season
in
the
Metropolitan
Opera
House
as
conducted
by
Anton
SeidI
sung
by
Emil
Fischer
And
don
t
you
know
that
Cornelius
was
a
pet
pupil
in
composition
of
Franz
Lizst
during
your
famous
fifties
That
The
Barber
of
Bagdad
was
produced
in
1858
at
Liszt
s
suggestion
in
Weimar
You
probably
do
know
more
than
I
you
know
more
than
anyone
living
or
dead
like
the
little
girl
in
the
play
for
you
the
King
is
always
naked
but
you
didn
t
know
about
the
Faust
symphony
and
the
important
part
it
played
in
Wagner
s
music-drama
because
you
never
read
with
understanding
the
Wagner-Liszt
correspondence
and
you
didn
t
know
about
Cornelius
and
his
acknowl
edged
indebtedness
to
Liszt
though
his
is
individual
and
truly
delightful
music
yet
you
know
more
about
music
than
I
Very
well
then
take
the
trouble
to
read
my
Liszt
study
1911
and
in
the
future
you
will
make
no
such
absurd
breaks
George
was
annoyed
because
I
had
challenged
him
to
play
the
first
movement
of
Chopin
s
E
minor
concerto
but
as
he
was
a
one
fingered
virtuoso
he
now
works
a
mechanical
piano
bless
his
musical
soul
and
he
answered
me
as
above
I
had
studied
the
Chopin
concerto
with
Rafael
Joseffy
my
copy
is
full
of
his
pencilled
fingering
and
phrasing
and
with
that
incomparable
master
at
the
second
piano
forte
I
had
played
the
allegro
At
least
I
can
play
it
better
than
the
Aged
Mariner
of
Adelphi
Terrace
isn
t
all
this
lovely
and
childish
our
daring
and
boasting
I
had
answered
a
letter
from
Shaw
August
1905
i3th
inst
in
an
equally
abusive
key
It
was
at
Sorrento
Italy
and
I
had
been
drinking
the
hot
heady
generous
Capri
wine
which
primed
me
for
retort
I
must
have
made
such
a
judicious
person
as
G
B
S
grieve
I
dared
him
to
take
off
his
shoes
and
show
the
world
the
web-foot
of
a
bog-trotter
This
charming
remark
I
had
remembered
in
some
Lever
novel
Uncle
George
must
have
smiled
but
he
never
turned
a
hair
His
reply
was
characteristic
Shaw
Your
chest
being
now
relieved
we
can
resume
cordial
relations
What
is
there
to
be
said
to
such
a
saintly
man
who
can
thus
turn
the
other
cheek
in
so
diplomatic
a
manner
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
after
the
peasant
lad
epi
sode
he
wrote
an
article
for
the
New
York
Metropolitan
Magazine
in
which
he
briefly
alluded
to
my
supposed
slip
Ah
the
honour
of
the
Shaw
family
was
at
stake
Shaw
the
socialist
He
ended
with
a
denial
of
the
fic
tion
that
I
was
trying
to
pass
off
as
truth
and
after
rallying
me
came
to
an
abrupt
close
with
Now
James
I
It
was
very
funny
to
me
and
to
my
friends
who
sent
me
numerous
clippings
of
the
sly
little
coda
Mr
Shaw
is
as
dangerous
as
an
army
with
brass
bands
to
argue
with
especially
in
public
and
the
only
reason
I
am
telling
all
these
highly
unimportant
things
is
because
someone
else
may
do
so
and
get
the
facts
muddled
I
am
now
convinced
that
Shaw
was
grooming
me
as
his
future
biographer
hence
the
hint
about
being
useful
to
me
But
I
was
not
a
bird
of
his
feather
and
could
not
be
per
suaded
to
alight
on
his
twig
there
to
be
snared
Pro
fessor
Archibald
Henderson
fell
into
the
trap
and
what
he
endured
while
spinning
his
yarn
fancy
writing
the
life
of
a
man
not
dead
really
the
autobiography
for
he
worked
with
Shaw
he
alone
can
tell
The
mean
est
part
of
the
thing
is
that
recently
Mr
Shaw
said
that
Mr
Chesterton
was
the
only
man
who
understood
him
gratitude
where
is
thy
Shaw
O
Shaw
where
is
thy
Archibald
I
have
been
told
that
another
of
my
offences
was
what
tessence
of
Shaw
I
asked
there
if
Mr
Shaw
is
brilliant
on
bran
what
would
he
not
be
on
beef
and
beer
This
question
angered
Mr
Beerbohm
possibly
I
might
have
asked
that
Mid
Victorian
if
his
imitation
of
the
essay
style
of
Charles
Lamb
did
sometimes
turn
out
cold
mutton
Perhaps
Bernard
Shaw
does
furtively
eat
roast-beef
sandwiches
and
at
midnight
perhaps
he
does
secretly
sip
Shandygaff
not
Kit
Morley
s
hippocrene
draught
but
the
garden
variety
of
half
ale
half
porter
Perish
the
proposition
Shaw
eating
meat
would
cause
more
of
a
row
than
did
the
revelations
of
Anna
Seuron
the
governess
in
the
Tolstoy
household
who
had
caught
old
man
Tolstoy
in
his
bare
feet
and
at
the
pantry
gobbling
raw
beef
And
the
hour
was
midnight
That
beef
lead
ing-motive
resounded
the
world
over
In
a
roundabout
fashion
I
heard
that
one
morning
while
at
Lady
Gregory
s
Mr
Shaw
came
down
to
breakfast
in
a
truly
masculine
mood
He
must
have
glanced
cannibalistically
at
the
cutlets
for
Mrs
Shaw
warningly
exclaimed
Now
George
He
is
said
to
have
uttered
Banshee
curses
and
to
have
pitched
in
and
eaten
a
pound
of
meat
or
was
it
hog
and
hominy
Ochone
And
he
may
have
smoked
a
pipe
in
the
hidden
gardens
of
Coole
Park
But
I
shan
t
vouch
for
the
respectability
of
the
anecdote
nor
am
I
violating
confidence
as
it
was
told
me
without
restrictions
though
not
by
Lady
Gregory
I
met
Mr
Shaw
at
Baireuth
in
1896
on
the
esplanade
of
the
Wagner
Theatre
where
he
informed
me
of
the
whereabouts
of
John
Runciman
music-critic
of
The
Saturday
Review
I
liked
the
looks
of
Shaw
tall
weedy
a
bearded
man
with
a
gangling
gait
I
liked
him
better
in
1903
when
I
saw
him
coming
from
a
per
formance
of
his
travesty
in
blank
verse
The
Admirable
Bashville
or
Constancy
Rewarded
at
the
Imperial
Theatre
Reformers
are
usually
dyspeptic
When
I
speak
to
them
I
always
turn
rny
head
the
other
way
especially
if
I
am
dose
to
a
man
who
doesn
t
drink
or
smoke
That
sort
is
pestiferous
But
Bernard
the
Shaw
is
eupeptic
He
may
have
a
weak
stomach
irrita
ble
nerves
like
most
thinkers
but
personally
he
is
as
sweet
and
wholesome
as
John
Burroughs
or
Edwin
Markham
He
has
magnetism
when
he
chooses
to
turn
on
the
current
He
looks
like
Everyman
He
is
far
from
handsome
and
his
brogue
is
Corkonian
Careless
as
to
dress
he
is
extremely
courteous
He
is
said
to
be
a
physi
cal
coward
but
boasts
the
rarer
quality
of
moral
heroism
He
wrote
at
the
time
of
McKinley
s
assassination
that
Czolgoz
was
the
bravest
man
in
America
because
he
stood
alone
Shaw
proved
that
he
didn
t
lack
moral
bravery
when
he
bearded
ex-Premier
Asquith
and
his
ministry
amid
the
execrations
of
the
press
in
England
and
America
Lloyd
George
owes
his
fellow-Celt
a
candle
Yet
this
dauntless
ink-slinger
once
ran
away
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
could
carry
him
from
a
socialistic
gathering
in
Hyde
Park
He
didn
t
propose
to
dodge
brickbats
and
dead
cats
realising
the
truth
that
he
who
fights
and
runs
away
will
live
to
fight
another
day
He
did
William
Morris
magnificent
man
and
poet
would
always
roar
when
he
related
this
anecdote
Daddy
Long-legs
he
called
Shaw
In
the
deep
and
earnest
eyes
of
Mr
Shaw
are
humour
and
kindliness
He
begged
me
not
to
write
anything
more
about
his
charitable
disposition
else
he
added
I
ll
be
having
all
the
beggars
in
London
at
my
back
door
And
a
mighty
good
thing
it
would
have
been
for
the
beggars
though
they
might
have
got
more
advice
than
ha
pence
Keep
it
up
Shamus
keep
it
up
I
can
hear
George
muttering
as
he
reads
this

HIS
LETTERS
An
extract
from
letter
dated
August
13
1905
You
are
quite
right
in
saying
that
I
lead
the
life
of
a
saint
that
is
my
trade
But
a
saint
is
not
what
you
allege
me
to
be
There
is
a
convention
that
saints
are
disin
terested
and
ascetic
just
as
there
is
a
convention
that
sailors
are
frank
and
generous
and
unsuspicious
When
you
try
to
make
out
that
I
pose
as
Diogenes
I
don
t
that
I
am
at
the
heart
just
the
same
sloppy
maudlin
coward
making
a
metre
of
it
as
the
feeblest
of
my
readers
I
fly
at
you
promptly
for
debasing
the
moral
currency
The
spectacle
of
Preacher
George
accusing
anyone
of
debasing
the
moral
currency
after
his
successful
efforts
at
the
game
is
enough
to
make
poor
old
George
Eliot
sit
up
on
her
eternal
gridiron
I
am
really
a
coward
speaking
with
authority
of
the
dangers
of
cowardice
a
sort
of
conceited
prig
who
has
found
out
the
weakness
of
the
current
morality
by
practising
it
a
voluptuary
who
finds
himself
not
on
the
infinite
illu
sions
of
a
monastic
imagination
but
on
a
sufficiency
of
actual
adventures
and
a
dozen
other
things
that
I
have
not
time
to
enumerate
Far
be
it
from
me
to
insinuate
that
the
spirit
in
my
Quintessence
of
Shaw
was
an
ironical
spirit
and
that
both
Beerbohm
and
Shaw
missed
it
whether
wilfully
or
not
I
can
t
say
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
entire
chapter
was
written
in
the
key
of
irony
extravagant
irony
and
that
a
professional
ironist
like
Max
and
a
Brummagen-Englfshman
like
Shaw
did
not
see
this
is
another
confirmation
of
the
suspicious
hatred
entertained
by
Europeans
generally
towards
our
playful
American
manner
I
did
call
Shaw
a
saint
jestingly
I
did
ad
dress
him
as
St
George
or
St
Bernard
I
did
say
that
secretly
he
was
a
sloppy
sentimentalist
And
he
of
all
men
became
enraged
at
my
very
palpable
fooling
Really
I
am
beginning
to
believe
in
Paul
Hervieu
s
re
mark
to
me
that
indulgence
in
the
mode
ironical
steril
ises
the
sense
of
humour
Nevertheless
I
cling
to
my
superstition
that
Shaw
is
a
wingless
angel
with
an
old
maid
s
temperament
but
one
who
can
t
take
a
joke
John
Quinn
is
right
the
Irish
are
witty
but
lack
the
saving
sense
of
humour
Shaw
never
had
an
original
idea
but
decorated
him
self
with
tall
feathers
pulled
from
Ibsen
Strindberg
Hauptmann
Sudermann
even
Maeterlinck
in
his
stage
directions
above
all
with
the
feathers
of
Marx
Nietzsche
and
Samuel
Butler
He
made
a
fortune
out
of
the
Nietzsche
philosophy
and
his
native
Irish
wit
and
im
pudence
imposed
on
a
public
innocent
of
the
sources
of
his
knowledge
But
oh
the
box-offices
of
this
peasant
lad
from
Cork
who
sold
his
Celtic
birthright
for
a
golden
mess
of
British
pottage
Neither
with
Synge
and
Yeats
nor
with
George
Moore
Joyce
or
Stephens
will
he
be
ranged
though
he
had
talent
for
fiction
wit
ness
his
clever
novels
And
now
after
lecturing
on
the
evil
of
being
Bernard
let
me
say
that
the
more
I
write
about
him
the
more
I
love
him
as
Oscar
Wilde
said
according
to
Vincent
O
SuIIivan
in
reply
to
the
ques
tion
Do
you
know
George
Moore
Yes
I
know
George
Moore
know
him
so
very
well
that
I
haven
t
spoken
to
him
for
ten
years
I
revere
Mr
Shaw
the
man
though
I
dissemble
my
love
and
I
admire
the
writer
who
succeeded
in
England
where
Ibsen
and
Nietzsche
did
not
while
exploiting
their
genius
to
his
own
uses
But
the
letters
of
George
Bernard
Shaw
Master
pieces
some
of
them
Superman
Billingsgate
also
We
had
another
tiff
over
a
letter
he
had
sent
me
relative
to
Candida
in
which
he
confided
to
my
discreation
to
use
what
I
wished
and
from
which
I
extracted
just
one
paragraph
to
be
found
on
page
254
of
Iconoclasts
He
had
this
St
Bernard
the
cheek
to
accuse
me
of
print
ing
his
letters
without
his
permission
he
all
the
while
hoping
and
praying
I
would
print
them
in
their
entirety
for
notoriety
is
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
He
even
per
suaded
several
critical
friends
in
London
that
I
had
been
indiscreet
and
I
was
duly
reproved
for
my
blithe
beha
viour
in
the
newspapers
You
shall
see
that
he
not
only
gave
me
permission
but
that
I
only
reproduced
one
para
graph
Possibly
he
feared
that
again
I
might
write
of
his
sporting
genealogy
that
he
was
W
S
Gilbert
out
of
Ibsen
and
an
extravagant
compliment
at
that
Nor
have
I
been
the
only
victim
in
this
respect
of
his
caprice
There
were
several
of
his
disciples
who
could
tell
the
same
tale
He
assured
me
that
I
had
picked
up
my
philosophy
from
the
gutter
meaning
that
he
hated
individualism
but
his
socialism
has
always
been
either
a
joke
or
a
puzzle
to
his
friends
and
socialists
alike
In
reality
Shaw
is
the
perfect
flowering
of
the
individualist
the
moral
anarch
in
action
Just
as
Henry
James
ex
pressed
his
dislike
of
Stendhal
without
whom
he
and
the
entire
modern
school
of
psychologists
in
fiction
would
not
have
been
as
they
are
this
includes
Bourget
Mere
dith
even
Tolstoy
who
has
handsomely
acknowledged
his
obligations
to
the
author
of
La
Chartreuse
de
Parme
so
Shaw
practically
admits
that
he
is
as
much
of
an
anarch
as
Max
Stirner
Karl
Marx
he
long
ago
repudi
ated
He
would
set
up
a
pontifical
throne
of
his
own
But
he
is
only
a
condiment
in
the
stodgy
stew
of
British
socialism
a
flavour
nothing
more
He
mocks
at
my
in
corrigible
romanticism
but
if
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
the
wages
of
goodness
may
be
insipidity
Dostoievsky
has
profoundly
said
that
One
must
be
really
a
great
man
to
be
able
to
make
a
stand
even
against
common
sense
Shaw
is
too
sensible
He
thinks
more
of
a
drain-pipe
than
a
cathedral
socialism
is
only
another
name
for
drain-pipes
and
while
modern
man
can
not
live
without
them
by
them
alone
he
can
not
live
And
he
has
paid
the
penalty
It
is
vision
not
open
plumbing
that
counts
Vision
Bernard
Shaw
has
not
in
his
heart
is
a
box-office
He
the
champion
of
liberty
is
a
philistine
Little
wonder
I
sent
him
a
post-card
from
Sorrento
in
answer
to
his
rakehelly
letters
and
with
this
inscription
a
tomb
and
on
it
the
words
Ci-git
the
first
of
the
Sha
vians
But
I
was
not
exact
There
is
only
one
and
last
Shavian
G
B
Shaw
And
if
the
whole
is
better
than
the
half
then
a
half-Shaw
is
better
than
no
bread
Let
us
begin
with
his
post-card
dated
12
August
1904
somewhere
in
Rosshire
This
is
well
I
shall
be
back
in
London
in
October
where
we
can
foregather
at
our
ease
Meanwhile
give
my
compliments
to
the
genial
sweet-mouthed
Ibsen
I
was
then
en
route
to
Norway
Of
Strindberg
I
have
a
high
opinion
possibly
because
I
have
read
very
little
of
him
chiefly
a
story
called
Memoirs
of
a
Madman
or
something
like
that
but
ought
to
have
been
called
The
Truth
About
My
Confounded
Wife
Probably
this
meant
Strindberg
s
autobiogra
phy
Inferno
The
truth
about
Candida
is
useless
no
body
will
believe
it
and
my
letter
will
be
scouted
as
an
obvious
invention
of
your
own
I
am
writing
a
play
about
Ireland
and
England
study
of
national
characteristics
Are
you
going
to
Vienna
by
any
chance
My
German
translator
Trebitsch
can
put
you
on
to
all
the
advanced
spirits
there
G
B
S
His
kind
offer
I
didn
t
take
advantage
of
as
I
had
lived
in
Vienna
and
knew
all
the
modern
crowd
Schnitzler
von
Hofmansthal
and
the
rest
My
translator
Madame
Lola
Lorme
lived
there
I
was
even
accorded
a
Huneker-Chopin
Evening
in
the
Bee
thoven
Saal
so
George
was
fetching
coals
to
Newcastle
From
London
under
date
of
4
January
1904
he
sent
me
a
very
interesting
communication
from
which
I
give
an
excerpt
Dear
Huneker
I
was
sorry
not
to
see
more
of
you
on
your
visit
here
as
you
struck
me
as
being
a
likable
old
ruffian
My
wife
since
your
review
of
Man
and
Superman
will
not
allow
that
you
have
a
spark
of
intelligence
but
you
must
come
and
mollify
her
in
person
when
you
are
over
next
It
always
amuses
me
to
see
Candida
stirring
up
oceans
of
sentiment
I
think
I
see
you
wallowing
in
it
Your
writing
always
interests
me
but
you
will
never
really
master
the
English
drama
until
you
study
English
life
and
character
I
speak
as
an
Irish
foreigner
who
has
had
to
learn
it
as
one
learns
Chinese
My
first
play
though
performed
in
a
crude
version
in
1892
was
not
completed
as
it
stands
at
present
until
I
had
been
more
than
twenty
years
in
London
and
a
great
deal
of
the
complaints
made
of
it
and
other
works
of
mine
by
Scotch
literary
men
in
London
you
know
that
the
literary
life
is
lived
in
a
vacuum
and
by
Yankees
by
yourself
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
Eng
lish
life
as
I
present
it
with
a
vestryman
s
and
politician
s
knowledge
of
it
to
say
nothing
of
my
private
adventures
is
irritatingly
unnatural
and
repugnant
When
I
am
on
the
general
human
nature
plane
they
are
delighted
with
me
When
I
am
on
the
English
plane
they
become
soreheaded
at
once
They
love
Candida
she
might
be
an
American
an
Irishwoman
a
Scotchwoman
any
woman
you
please
But
take
my
specifically
Englishwomen
Blanche
in
Widower
s
House
only
one
remove
from
her
grandmother
s
washtub
Vivie
Warren
Lady
Cicely
Waynflete
in
that
excellent
Christian
tract
Captain
Brassbound
s
Conversion
and
above
all
Ann
White
field
and
Violet
Robinson
in
the
Superman
drama
Ann
being
my
most
gorgeous
female
creation
you
can
no
more
appreciate
these
from
the
other
side
of
the
Atlantic
clever
as
you
are
than
you
could
write
Anthony
Trol
lope
s
novels
The
men
annoy
you
in
the
same
way
you
can
see
the
fun
of
Brittannus
in
Caesar
and
Cleo
patra
and
perhaps
of
the
American
captain
in
Brass
bound
and
young
Malone
in
the
Superman
where
national
types
are
openly
made
fun
of
but
the
Hooligan
in
Brassbound
the
chauffeur
Straker
in
the
Superman
the
whole
gang
in
Widower
s
House
arouse
your
instinc
tive
anti-English
prejudice
almost
as
if
they
had
been
done
by
Thackeray
who
was
so
stupidly
English
that
being
a
man
of
genius
he
wasted
his
life
for
gentility
s
sake
on
silly
tittle-tattle
relieved
by
occasional
maudlin
drivel
Note
Mr
Shaw
forgot
that
London
is
not
far
from
New
York
forgot
that
the
characters
he
believed
to
be
incomprehensible
and
irritating
to
Americans
are
old
friends
from
a
half-hundred
fictions
previous
to
his
and
as
for
his
notion
of
our
national
types
yes
we
did
laugh
over
them
because
they
were
such
caricatures
from
the
Shavian
shadow-land
Abandon
all
reality
ye
who
enter
here
might
be
a
motto
for
his
fantastic
plays
There
is
no
instinctive
anti-English
prejudice
among
Americans
unless
they
happen
to
be
professional
Irish-Americans
Curious
though
the
instinctive
Irish
prejudice
against
Thackeray
that
endures
They
have
never
forgiven
him
his
stupid
strictures
on
the
people
and
customs
of
Erin
Shaw
continues
in
the
same
vein
I
tell
you
you
don
t
appreciate
the
vitality
of
the
English
you
see
nothing
but
their
stupidity
their
moral
cowardice
their
utter
lack
of
common
sense
their
nai
ve
acquisitiveness
their
brainless
cruelty
to
children
and
criminals
their
uncritical
obtuseness
or
idolatry
as
the
case
may
be
their
childish
unscrupulousness
their
in
sensibility
to
and
disbelief
in
any
means
of
persuasion
except
intimidation
and
coercion
and
all
the
rest
of
it
And
the
stupidity
peculiar
to
the
Englishman
which
prevents
him
from
knowing
what
he
is
doing
is
really
a
stroke
of
genius
on
his
part
and
is
far
more
voluntary
than
the
bright
American
thinks
Cromwell
said
that
no
man
goes
further
than
the
man
who
doesn
t
know
where
he
is
going
and
in
that
you
have
the
whole
secret
of
English
success
What
is
the
use
of
being
bright
witty
subtle
genial
if
these
qualities
lead
to
the
subjec
tion
and
poverty
of
India
and
Ireland
and
to
the
political
anarchy
and
corruption
of
the
United
States
What
says
my
beautiful
vital
victorious
odious-to-all-good
Americans
Miss
Ann
Whitefield
The
only
really
simple
thing
is
to
go
straight
for
what
you
want
and
grab
it
How
disgusting
How
cynical
so
say
you
and
so
also
say
the
Filipino
and
the
Red
Indian
of
you
and
yours
Note
To
us
the
chief
characteristic
of
Ann
was
peculiarly
Yankee
Would
you
like
to
see
what
the
English
think
of
the
Americans
Read
Algernon
Casterton
by
Lady
Sykes
a
recent
English
novel
There
you
will
see
the
English
conception
of
the
American
woman
as
a
cold-blooded
sexless
prostitute
who
sells
herself
without
scruple
and
without
affection
to
the
men
who
can
give
her
the
best
time
in
London
society
and
who
makes
her
husband
pay
for
her
favours
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
This
is
a
revolting
notion
to
an
Englishman
whose
chief
concep
tion
of
a
wife
is
a
woman
who
will
not
only
keep
house
for
him
in
return
for
her
board
but
will
allow
him
the
use
of
her
person
gratuitously
Some
day
I
will
write
a
play
showing
the
good
side
of
this
American
sexlessness
of
which
London
complains
so
much
However
the
moral
for
you
is
study
the
Eng
lish
There
is
much
to
be
learnt
from
them
and
I
who
have
been
struggling
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
with
their
knavish
brainlessness
lose
patience
often
enough
but
I
get
on
with
them
very
well
personally
find
them
enormously
interesting
have
got
a
good
deal
of
training
from
them
and
in
short
intend
to
stay
here
and
be
one
of
the
glories
of
literature
What
is
this
tom
fool
story
about
my
objecting
to
Mansfield
s
Bluntschli
Arms
and
the
Man
I
never
saw
it
never
objected
to
it
All
these
Mansfield
stories
are
fudge
They
are
not
exaggerations
quite
the
contrary
Richard
s
repu
tation
is
a
feeble
vulgar
blundering
attempt
to
suggest
an
outrageous
but
actual
truth
But
we
are
on
excellent
terms
He
tells
me
that
the
American
public
will
not
stand
me
that
The
Devil
s
Disciple
was
played
by
him
to
empty
houses
out
of
sheer
devotion
to
art
On
the
other
hand
I
call
him
Pompey
and
revile
him
as
an
obsolete
barnstormer
because
he
funked
Caesar
and
would
not
even
condescend
to
notice
my
alternative
offer
to
let
him
play
the
waiter
in
You
Never
Can
Tell
But
these
passages
leave
no
bad
blood
because
I
have
in
my
desk
the
returns
showing
that
the
American
public
spent
about
150,000
to
gloat
over
his
Richard
Dudgeon
and
he
considers
Cassar
and
Cleopatra
an
imbecile
bur
lesque
So
we
both
remain
each
perfectly
pleased
with
himself
and
perfectly
friendly
Who

But
alas
Ada

that

rot
could
see
no

Does
not
this

Follows
the

paragraph
the
one
I
quoted
in
Iconoclasts
in
1905
Dear
Huneker
Don
t
ask
me
conundrums
about
that
immoral
female
Candida
Observe
the
entry
of
W
Bur
gess
You
re
not
the
lady
h
used
to
typewrite
for
him
Prossy
is
a
very
highly
selected
young
person
indeed
devoted
to
Morell
to
the
extent
of
helping
him
in
the
kitchen
but
to
him
the
merest
pet
rabbit
unable
to
get
the
smallest
hold
on
him
Candida
is
as
unscrupulous
as
Siegfried
Morell
himself
at
least
sees
that
that
no
law
will
bind
her
She
seduces
Eugene
just
exactly
as
far
as
it
is
worth
her
while
to
seduce
him
She
is
a
woman
without
character
in
the
conventional
sense
Without
brains
and
strength
of
mind
she
would
be
a
wretched
slattern
and
voluptuary
She
is
straight
for
natural
means
not
for
conventional
ethical
ones
Noth
ing
can
be
more
cold-bloodedly
reasonable
than
her
fare
well
to
Eugene
All
very
well

lad

I
don
t
quite
see
myself
at
50
with
a
husband
of
35
It
s
just
this
freedom
from
emotional
slop
this
unerring
wisdom
on
the
domestic
plane
that
makes
her
so
completely
mis
tress
of
the
situation
Then
consider
the
poet
She
makes
a
man
of
him
finally
by
showing
him
his
own
strength
that
David
must
do
without
poor
Uriah
s
wife
And
then
she
pitches
in
her
picture
of
the
home
the
onions
and
the
tradesmen
and
the
cosseting
of
big
baby
Morell
The
New
York
hausfrau
thinks
it
a
little
paradise
but
the
poet
rises
up
and
says
Out
then
into
the
night
with
me
Tristan
s
holy
night
If
this
greasy
fool
s
paradise
is
happiness
then
I
give
it
to
you
with
both
hands
life
is
nobler
than
that
That
is
the
poet
s
secret
The
young
things
in
front
weep
to
see
the
poor
boy
going
out
lonely
and
bareheaded
in
the
cold
night
to
save
the
proprieties
of
New
England
Puri
tanism
but
he
is
really
a
god
going
back
to
his
heaven
proud
unspeakably
contemptuous
of
the
happiness
he
envied
in
the
days
of
his
blindness
clearly
seeing
that
he
has
higher
business
on
hand
than
Candida
She
has
a
little
quaint
intuition
of
the
completeness
of
his
cure
she
says
he
has
learnt
to
do
without
happiness
As
I
should
certainly
be
lynched
by
the
infuriated
Candidamanics
if
this
view
of
the
case
were
made
known
I
confide
it
to
your
discretion
I
tell
it
to
you
because
it
is
an
interesting
example
of
the
way
a
scene
which
could
be
conceived
and
written
only
by
transcending
the
ordinary
notion
of
the
relations
between
the
persons
nevertheless
stirs
the
ordinary
emotions
to
a
very
high
degree
all
the
more
because
the
language
of
the
poet
to
those
who
have
not
the
clue
to
it
is
mysterious
and
bewildering
and
therefore
worshipful
I
divined
it
myself
before
I
found
out
the
whole
truth
about
it
Blank
is
a
very
decent
fellow
but
he
persists
like
most
intellectuals
in
dictating
conditions
to
a
world
which
has
to
organise
itself
in
obedience
to
laws
of
life
which
he
doesn
t
understand
any
more
than
you
or
I
Individualism
is
all
very
well
as
a
study
product
but
that
is
not
what
is
happening
Society
is
integrating
not
individualising
and
it
is
better
to
lay
hold
of
what
is
doing
and
make
the
best
of
it
than
to
sit
complaining
that
it
won
t
do
something
else
Trusts
are
most
excel
lent
things
as
superior
to
competitive
shopkeeperism
as
symphonies
are
to
cornet
solos
but
they
need
more
careful
scoring
and
longer
rehearsals
and
better
conduct
ing
The
only
individualism
worth
looking
at
now
is
breeding
the
race
and
getting
rid
of
the
promiscuity
and
profligacy
called
marriage
Is
there
such
a
thing
in
America
as
a
decent
pub
lisher
one
whom
I
could
trust
in
reason
to
sell
my
books
on
commission
if
I
manufactured
them
myself
I
am
tired
of
wasting
time
negotiating
with
fools
who
are
afraid
to
publish
the
Superman
and
rogues
who
want
to
get
too
soft
a
bargain
over
it
It
is
copyrighted
all
safely
but
it
lies
there
dead
whilst
McClures
and
Harper
s
and
the
like
funk
it
and
others
want
to
grab
it
forever
and

Yr
G
Bernard
Shaw
Thus
Shaw
on
Shaw
Doubtless
he
changed
his
mind
many
times
since
1904
Candida
may
have
become
to
him
charmless
She
was
transferred
from
Ibsen
s
Lady
of
the
Sea
with
the
charm
and
poetry
omitted
Ibsen
too
can
be
charmless
but
his
small-town
frumps
are
often
vital
intense
Both
Ibsen
and
Nietzsche
were
butchered
to
make
a
Shavian
holiday
In
Iconoclasts
1
have
paid
my
tribute
to
the
brilliant
gifts
of
Mr
Shaw
to
his
in
vincible
courage
love
of
his
fellow
beings
for
if
he
chides
us
it
is
only
to
correct
our
weaknesses
his
detestation
of
cruelty
and
injustice
his
splendid
sincerity
and
super
abundance
of
normal
sense
also
to
his
sublime
capacity
for
distorting
facts
if
it
suits
his
mood
With
his
cos
mical
intellect
he
should
not
be
a
mere
playwright
amusing
an
inconstant
public
with
his
profound
japes
and
jests
he
should
be
Premier
Pope
or
Kaiser
I
proffer
no
apologies
for
quoting
him
so
freely
indeed
I
think
he
should
feel
indebted
to
me
for
my
generous
spirit
But
I
m
quite
sure
he
won
t
Yet
as
I
have
said
before
I
have
no
grievance
against
Mr
Shaw
He
is
or
was
my
most
distinguished
enemy
I
must
add
that
he
has
most
graciously
given
me
permission
to
re
print
in
part
the
foregoing
letters
The
query
about
a
publisher
was
soon
answered
I
went
to
my
old
friend
Arthur
Brentano
and
within
a
week
Mr
Shaw
was
provided
with
the
best
of
publishers
Since
then
all
his
books
and
plays
have
been
handled
by
this
enterprising
house
and
I
think
the
unsentimental
socialist
has
had
no
cause
to
complain
over
the
arrange
ment
I
need
hardly
say
that
as
I
am
not
a
literary
agent
I
was
not
interested
in
the
transaction
except
as
a
friend
of
author
and
publisher
It
was
another
case
of
being
useful
to
Mr
Shaw
and
he
was
duly
grateful
I
should
not
have
resurrected
these
memories
if
I
had
not
been
delving
into
the
past
as
I
think
it
prudent
to
let
sleeping
Shavians
lie
but
when
he
is
naughty
he
has
to
be
rebuked
even
if
he
is
a
naughty
grandfather
on
whose
banner
is
inscribed
the
strange
device
Equality
Envy
Indigestion
Ah
if
you
had
only
come
over
here
years
ago
Master
we
might
have
civilised
made
something
out
of
you
if
only
a

in

Hall
A
HALF-HAMLET
It
is
lucky
for
a
man
that
he
doesn
t
marry
his
first
love
luckier
for
the
woman
Some
Russian
has
said
Dostoievsky
I
think
that
man
is
unhappy
because
he
doesn
t
know
he
is
happy
Most
men
live
in
a
state
of
in
nocence
till
they
marry
Then
they
awaken
and
remorse
sets
in
Women
don
t
believe
this
because
woman
is
as
a
rule
incapable
of
remorse
Let
me
relate
the
story
of
my
most
interesting
sentimental
hesitations
a
story
in
which
the
heroine
is
a
half-Hamlet
and
also
plays
the
r6Ie
of
real
protagonist
I
was
in
love
yet
an
onlooker
But
what
an
enchantment
of
the
heart
1
It
happened
in
Rome
years
ago
I
was
young
green
as
a
green
apricot
and
overflowing
with
belief
in
woman
and
a
constitutional
distrust
of
myself
That
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
An
October
sun
slanted
its
yellow
glory
from
the
west
ern
sky
as
I
entered
the
narrow
gate
of
the
Protestant
cemetery
which
I
had
achieved
after
a
dusty
walk
from
my
apartment
at
the
top
of
the
Spanish
Stairs
by
way
of
the
Porta
San
Paolo
I
was
warm
and
craved
repose
palms
pines
willows
olives
aloes
and
flame-shaped
cypresses
in
shaded
alleys
promised
a
pleasing
haven
It
was
my
favourite
spot
Summer
afternoons
when
Rome
was
a
faded
photograph
of
herself
I
would
read
sitting
on
the
grassy
mounds
above
the
bones
of
the
buried
Keats
and
Shelley
touched
my
imagination
here
as
nowhere
I
had
become
selfish
about
the
place
and
resented
the
appearance
of
strangers
odious
tourists
carrying
red
books
who
talked
loudly
whispered
gig
gled
or
stared
condescendingly
So
sensitive
was
I
that
invariably
I
questioned
Angelo
the
smiling
guardian
of
the
doorway
as
to
the
number
of
foreign
invaders
On
this
occasion
Angelo
held
up
two
fingers
I
sighed
my
relief
A
pair
of
humans
I
could
avoid
Up
the
gentle
slope
which
leads
to
the
tombs
of
Shelley
and
Trelawney
I
slowly
passed
To
my
annoyance
I
saw
a
man
and
woman
before
the
altar
of
the
dead
The
woman
was
on
her
knees
Even
that
appropriate
attitude
did
not
mollify
me
They
were
intruders
I
hurried
down-hill
and
went
to
the
grave
of
Keats
There
at
least
was
grief
made
more
classic
by
the
appearance
of
the
Cestius
pyramid
But
again
I
was
disappointed
for
the
appeal
ing
voices
of
beggar-boys
came
to
me
through
gratings
in
the
nearest
wall
I
shook
a
threatening
head
at
these
importuners
and
strode
away
It
was
one
of
my
gloomy
days
when
all
the
poetry
stored
up
in
me
mingled
with
my
spiritual
spleen
and
caused
dolorous
hours
I
was
then
of
a
receptive
temperament
without
an
outlet
for
peri
odical
crises
of
emotion
I
would
joke
about
this
con
dition
calling
it
a
congestion
of
the
poetic
centres
yet
I
was
bitterly
chagrined
when
I
realised
my
inability
to
relieve
myself
in
creative
verse
Suddenly
my
shoulder
was
brushed
and
a
contralto
voice
asked
a
pardon
in
English
It
was
the
lady
I
had
seen
kneeling
She
was
garbed
in
green
and
carried
flowers
which
she
placed
on
the
grave
of
Keats
not
for
getting
his
beloved
friend
John
Severn
who
lies
hard
by
in
the
ground
She
again
knelt
and
her
face
in
her
ungloved
hands
she
seemed
more
in
meditation
than
prayer
Her
fingers
pressed
against
her
eyes
were
thin
and
white
yet
suggested
nervous
force
When
she
re
moved
them
and
arose
to
rejoin
her
companion
I
saw
the
features
of
a
young
woman
which
attracted
because
of
their
purity
and
intense
expression
But
I
could
not
conceive
how
anyone
could
thus
sorrow
after
a
dead
poet
I
love
Keats
revere
his
resting-place
but
this
this
was
something
more
personal
Perhaps
I
mused
as
I
looked
at
the
woman
s
slender
figure
she
is
some
sentimental
girl
who
had
especially
visited
Rome
to
stand
at
the
tomb
of
one
whose
name
is
not
writ
in
water
but
on
imperishable
marble
For
a
moment
I
was
stirred
by
the
image
of
the
act
and
then
felt
a
wave
of
irrita
tion
mount
within
me
She
had
reached
her
former
position
and
I
noticed
that
the
man
with
her
was
big
of
frame
expansive
in
his
movements
and
dressed
like
an
Englishman
abroad
At
once
I
instinctively
disliked
him
My
nerves
told
me
that
I
was
unstrung
and
I
wondered
whether
I
had
made
a
mistake
by
remaining
in
Rome
all
summer
the
notion
that
I
was
suffering
from
a
mild
attack
of
malaria
was
more
grateful
than
the
con
viction
that
it
was
hypersesthesia
This
feeling
prompted
me
to
walk
boldly
towards
the
couple
as
I
lifted
my
hat
Otherwise
why
should
I
shy
and
slightly
supercilious
risk
a
snub
from
strangers
They
cordially
received
me
and
the
man
said
in
a
booming
bass
voice
Really
it
s
joyous
to
meet
a
countryman
in
this
lonely
cemetery
I
was
telling
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
But
Lewis
how
do
you
know
the
gentleman
is
English
interposed
the
lady
I
made
a
nervous
gesture
of
dissent
I
am
an
American
but
I
adore
your
poets
She
glanced
her
gratitude
and
would
have
spoken
but
for
the
jarring
laughter
of
her
husband
After
this
he
effusively
exclaimed
I
ll
never
go
by
clothes
At
all
events
you
have
an
English
tailor
Annoyed
I
bowed
yet
without
the
acrid
feeling
I
had
smothered
a
few
moments
before
so
sudden
was
the
revo
lution
of
my
mood
Bearded
imposing
in
girth
with
the
head
of
a
fighter
of
a
master
of
enterprises
Saint-Hilary
had
made
an
immediate
impression
Either
one
liked
him
or
got
out
of
his
pathway
He
was
given
to
elbowing
his
way
through
the
crowds
of
life
and
I
realised
the
animal
force
and
attractiveness
of
this
new
acquaintance
Presently
I
was
engaged
in
analysing
the
charm
of
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
She
was
one
of
those
rare
women
whose
air
is
captivating
in
its
candour
I
set
her
down
as
a
poet
and
then
I
remembered
in
a
flash
Of
course
She
was
the
wife
of
the
robust
correspondent
of
a
promi
nent
English
newspaper
I
smiled
I
think
we
ought
to
know
each
other
I
ventured
There
is
at
least
one
drawing-room
in
Rome
where
we
may
meet
some
day
The
girl
clasped
her
hands
crying
I
knew
it
The
Bernervilles
And
you
are
James
Huneker
who
reads
poetry
on
the
tombs
of
Keats
and
Shelley
and
transposes
their
poetry
to
the
key
of
Schumann
and
Chopin
What
did
I
say
Lewis
What
did
I
say
She
was
all
en
thusiasm
and
my
perplexity
increased
as
I
recalled
her
earlier
elegiac
expression
The
nonsense
about
Shelley
and
Chopin
Mrs
Bernerville
must
have
been
in
one
of
her
exaggerated
gossipy
moods
The
husband
took
my
hand
I
liked
you
from
the
first
Old
Bernerville
told
me
about
you
You
are
very
solid
over
there
He
nodded
in
the
direction
of
Rome
Yes
I
some
times
read
here
oftener
dream
my
afternoons
away
In
fine
I
m
a
dilettante
and
that
s
why
I
love
Rome
of
all
cities
it
is
the
one
where
you
can
be
the
laziest
with
most
dignity
We
talked
of
our
friends
of
our
preferences
in
art
and
literature
of
our
beloved
poets
Saint-Hilary
proposed
departing
We
live
up
in
the
Ludovisi
Quarter
on
the
Via
Sallustiana
and
darkness
soon
comes
these
autumn
days
Let
us
walk
as
far
as
the
Porta
San
Paolo
and
take
carriage
there
And
I
am
at
the
Trinita
de
Monti
Our
neighbour
practically
said
the
Eng
lishman
Come
we
must
be
going
Dottie
I
felt
resentful
Dottie
What
a
name
And
how
little
suited
to
her
spiritual
personality
was
her
good-natured
tiresome
husband
In
the
carriage
facing
Mrs
Saint
Hilary
I
studied
her
face
Her
eyes
reflected
the
slaty
grey-green
of
the
sky
For
me
she
was
like
a
harp
that
vibrated
yet
had
never
sounded
the
eternal
music
within
her
When
a
young
man
wishes
to
resolve
the
enigma
of
a
strange
woman
to
evoke
her
submerged
music
he
is
likely
to
push
his
curiosity
beyond
its
province
his
virtu
osity
beyond
its
power
I
remembered
this
as
I
slowly
walked
along
the
Via
Sistina
The
weather
was
chilly
one
of
those
damp
evenings
in
which
sounds
a
cheerless
autumn
the
leading-motive
of
a
rapidly
approaching
winter
I
did
not
feel
in
a
resilient
humour
if
at
that
precise
minute
I
could
have
avoided
visiting
the
Berner
villes
I
should
have
been
almost
content
I
knew
that
the
Saint-Hilarys
were
to
be
there
Mrs
Bernerville
had
written
me
a
brief
breathless
note
full
of
underlined
adjectives
and
enthusiastic
gasps
O
what
an
impres
sion
I
had
made
on
her
dear
friends
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
had
not
minced
her
words
I
looked
like
an
artist
while
her
husband
dear
old
bluff
Saint-Hilary
a
rough
diamond
and
a
man
of
importance
in
the
literary
world
he
too
likes
you
a
good
fellow
he
calls
you
very
different
from
the
average
critic
I
sniffed
She
was
impossibly
delightful
cette
dame
Why
had
I
given
her
my
books
I
reddened
at
the
ascription
average
critic
What
impertinence
What
a
patronising
tone
I
regretted
my
promise
I
loathed
strange
people
For
me
success
in
life
meant
avoiding
new
faces
Even
the
memory
of
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
s
face
vaguely
silhouetted
in
the
twilight
did
not
touch
me
Her
mystery
evap
orated
in
the
flabby
phrases
of
Mrs
Bernerville
besides
the
Bernervilles
were
too
rich
the
possession
of
much
money
results
in
grossness
I
had
reached
the
Piazza
Barbarina
and
its
rococo
Bernini
Tritons
Soon
I
was
shaking
hands
with
my
hostess
wondering
why
I
had
come
It
s
good
to
see
you
were
her
welcoming
words
I
ve
asked
no
one
but
the
Saint-Hilarys
Bernerville
expects
his
old
pirate
as
he
calls
him
the
Prince
Abbazia
that
stupid
old
bore
I
thought
but
let
us
go
to
the
fire
What
disagreeable
nights
we
are
getting
I
recall
Rome
when
its
Octobers
were
like
the
Mays
of
Florence
Mrs
Bernerville
was
in
the
fading
fifties
small
alert
her
face
like
a
wizened
pear
She
said
she
was
from
Boston
but
in
moments
of
mockery
her
husband
would
mention
the
name
of
a
small
Western
town
as
her
birth
place
She
always
endured
this
sarcasm
with
placid
humour
under
the
severest
strain
her
temper
always
was
admirable
Dressed
in
black
lace
wearing
a
collar
of
black
pearls
she
appeared
to
me
a
richly
evolved
beetle
including
its
celerity
she
would
circle
about
a
room
about
her
husband
or
a
victim
with
an
accompany
ing
loquacity
that
compelled
rather
than
charmed
The
Salon
was
empty
save
for
our
presence
Sitting
opposite
the
fireplace
I
forgot
my
irritability
as
I
listened
to
her
budget
of
gossip
about
people
we
knew
I
longed
to
put
a
few
questions
concerning
the
Saint-Hilarys
Who
was
the
wife
Had
they
been
married
many
years
But
my
companion
pursued
a
zigzag
monologue
in
which
she
exposed
with
touching
innocence
the
troubles
of
Count
O
Ragan
and
his
pretty
spouse
She
had
her
own
theory
concerning
the
course
of
this
unfortunate
marital
squab
ble
it
was
not
altogether
the
fault
of
the
Count
and
his
passion
for
gambling
Oh
no
If
she
dared
why
yes
certainly
the
Saint-Hilarys
were
happy
Whoever
doubted
it
Dottie
is
Irish
her
husband
need
one
ask
English
He
is
a
trump
his
wife
a
bit
of
humbug
Dottie
a
humbug
For
me
such
familiarity
bred
frost
And
continued
Mrs
Bernerville
she
is
a
poet
like
yourself
I
raised
deprecating
hands
Dear
lady
I
am
not
a
poet
only
a
dreamer
Pray
do
not
say
any
more
about
my
books
My
poetry
goes
into
the
waste
basket
After
all
the
praises
you
have
heaped
on
my
ineffectual
head
I
fear
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
will
find
me
a
sad
disappointment
Praise
I
Why
I
really
told
her
you
were
an
inarticulate
Milton
or
was
it
Browning
If
you
would
only
fall
in
love
and
be
jilted
you
might
possibly
overwhelm
us
with
a
masterpiece
But
don
t
fall
in
love
with
our
Dottie
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
Ah
there
you
are
Bernerville
Glad
of
the
interruption
I
cordially
greeted
the
old
man
The
Miltonic
allusion
had
put
my
politeness
to
the
straining
test
Oh
for
a
vast
wilderness
from
which
the
tactless
would
be
forever
barred
How
axe
you
feeling
young
man
Why
don
t
we
see
you
oftener
If
I
m
not
in
there
s
the
Madame
who
can
discourse
Shakespeare
and
the
musical
glasses
And
then
don
t
forget
I
have
some
wonderful
Burgundy
in
my
cellar
What
you
miss
The
short
apoplectic
Bernerville
with
his
brilliant
Oriental
eyes
his
whee
dling
red
lips
and
old-fashioned
side-whiskers
looked
more
like
a
Wall
Street
banker
than
an
American
who
had
lived
in
Italy
thirty
years
Oh
let
s
talk
of
music
impa
tiently
broke
in
his
wife
We
were
talking
of
Sgambati
and
Liszt
I
closed
my
eyes
resignedly
I
was
accus
tomed
to
her
foreshortenings
of
the
truth
She
would
talk
of
Sgambati
with
whom
she
had
studied
ten
or
twenty
years
earlier
and
of
Liszt
and
the
Princess
Sayn
Wittgenstein
before
the
end
of
the
evening
It
was
one
of
my
particular
tortures
to
hear
from
her
rapidly
mov
ing
lips
the
secret
reason
why
Cardinal
Antonelli
had
in
terfered
with
the
projected
marriage
of
Liszt
She
even
insinuated
that
Liszt
had
asked
the
Cardinal
to
refuse
his
consent
as
the
pianist-composer
wished
somehow
to
wriggle
out
of
his
promise
to
marry
that
formidable
bluestocking
the
Princess
I
had
been
retold
that
in
cident
at
least
a
hundred
times
I
say
where
are
our
guests
It
s
nearly
ten
o
clock
No
Saint-Hilary
no
Dottie
the
passionate
pilgrim
no
Abbazia
I
wonder
where
that
old
pirate
is
Berner
ville
held
his
wrath
in
his
pudgy
white
hand
and
wickedly
smiled
His
friends
often
boasted
that
he
could
shatter
any
reputation
with
a
gleam
of
his
shining
teeth
The
sound
of
a
remote
door
closing
then
approaching
foot
steps
it
must
be
the
Saint-Hilarys
Unannounced
they
entered
the
lady
on
gliding
feet
Saint-Hilary
following
with
his
amiable
shuffle
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
did
not
seem
too
cordial
while
her
husband
with
his
air
of
false
bon
homie
was
intolerable
These
people
who
had
been
so
desirable
the
other
day
at
close
range
were
average
folk
With
pessimistic
fancy
I
immediately
saw
everything
drab
She
had
not
removed
her
wraps
in
the
anteroom
she
was
a
privileged
person
there
was
a
touch
of
fur
on
her
shoulders
and
the
round
Astrakhan
hat
on
her
shapely
head
gave
her
an
exotic
air
A
Russian
princess
fresh
from
the
Neva
a
driver
of
snow-sledge
and
rein
deers
I
saw
the
light
from
the
blazing
logs
reverberate
from
the
deep
grey
eyes
Then
she
went
into
the
apart
ment
of
Mrs
Bernerville
and
I
wondered
why
such
a
trivial
happening
as
the
reflection
of
fire
in
a
woman
s
eyes
sweet-cupped
and
dark-lashed
should
so
trouble
my
soul
Come
into
the
den
and
have
something
decent
before
you
begin
to
slop
tea
growled
Bernerville
to
the
two
men
I
will
that
was
the
ready
response
of
Saint
Hilary
I
shook
my
head
I
preferred
staring
into
the
flame
hoping
that
it
might
evoke
her
glance
As
the
ladies
returned
the
expected
Prince
arrived
He
stiffly
bowed
and
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
smoking-room
Mrs
Bernerville
laughed
We
will
excuse
you
Ab
bazia
They
are
in
there
I
m
thirsty
he
curtly
replied
and
disappeared
Bernerville
has
odd
cronies
hasn
t
he
asked
his
wife
You
ve
been
coming
to
this
house
for
years
Tell
me
have
you
ever
met
an
intimate
of
my
husband
s
you
could
converse
with
over
a
minute
I
replied
Frankly
no
Have
you
written
much
asked
in
her
modulated
tones
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
I
forgave
her
the
brusqueness
of
her
salutation
At
one
swift
leap
all
my
early
interest
re
vived
It
was
her
voice
that
held
me
it
was
as
tender
as
the
green
of
newly
put
forth
leaves
You
are
a
poet
she
gaily
asserted
what
image
held
your
tongue
in
check
then
Come
give
us
the
fresh
vintage
of
your
fancy
Her
husband
away
she
fairly
warmed
the
Celt
in
her
eyes
and
their
melancholy
setting
I
stam
mered
My
conceit
deserted
me
An
inward
necessity
bade
me
keep
silent
though
I
longed
to
respond
in
lyric
phrase
The
first
man
who
compared
a
woman
with
a
rose
was
a
poet
Voltaire
averred
but
the
second
a
fool
So
I
did
what
infatuated
poets
have
done
before
me
I
kept
my
peace
and
drank
my
tea
hot
Not
only
did
I
feel
like
a
fool
I
know
I
acted
one
The
two
women
chatted
over
their
work
Mrs
Bernerville
politely
in
quired
if
Mr
Saint-Hilary
would
soon
finish
his
book
on
Celtic
Antiquities
He
is
a
desperately
lazy
man
my
husband
notwithstanding
his
bigness
He
thinks
he
has
laboured
like
a
galley-slave
when
he
has
finished
his
daily
stint
for
his
newspaper
Aren
t
men
naturally
slothful
She
turned
to
me
I
am
if
I
may
reason
from
the
general
to
the
particular
Yes
but
you
are
a
poet
I
am
not
I
love
poetry
as
much
as
music
but
I
never
write
it
You
know
what
dear
Mrs
Bernerville
says
of
you
That
I
m
an
inarticulate
I
flushed
I
don
t
believe
it
You
will
write
when
the
time
comes
Some
friendly
soul
should
stir
you
Ah
but
where
is
she
My
tone
was
so
mocking
that
the
two
women
rallied
me
The
elder
vivaciously
ex
claimed
If
you
are
going
to
talk
like
that
I
ll
leave
you
alone
and
go
see
what
mischief
those
men
are
up
to
Esthetics
bore
me
She
scampered
away
The
silence
endured
several
minutes
Mrs
Saint
Hilary
went
to
the
fire
Her
eyes
were
dark
her
face
flushed
I
thought
I
detected
a
certain
fatigue
in
them
the
face
with
its
decidedly
irregular
profile
was
without
distinction
at
this
moment
Perhaps
she
was
not
so
happy
as
her
friends
believed
She
spoke
I
think
I
recognise
in
you
a
trait
of
our
time
Every
generation
produces
its
share
of
souls
disillusioned
All
sorts
of
in
genious
also
silly
theories
are
put
forth
to
explain
those
souls
Some
say
decadent
Poor
overworked
word
I
hazarded
True
but
handy
for
the
phrase-makers
I
interrupted
Candidly
I
can
t
complain
of
my
health
And
if
I
ve
published
no
verse
that
s
no
reason
why
you
should
suspect
me
as
a
pessimist
You
are
not
a
pessimist
she
gravely
said
You
might
be
summed
up
as
a
half-Hamlet
one
who
dares
not
but
may
I
was
flattered
and
wondered
with
the
fatuity
of
youth
why
she
took
so
much
interest
in
my
case
She
read
my
mood
Then
with
a
burst
of
gaiety
Now
don
t
let
us
become
morbid
discussing
your
hidden
ambitions
I
know
your
sort
Saint-Hilary
Good
heavens
He
is
a
steam-engine
And
what
a
gift
of
expression
She
paused
and
lightly
adjusting
with
her
slim
fingers
an
ornament
in
her
hair
she
rapidly
moved
around
the
dimly
lighted
room
I
followed
her
with
my
eyes
my
envy
of
her
husband
revived
by
her
warm
praise
Yet
a
few
moments
before
she
had
called
him
lazy
Logic
from
such
a
temperament
You
are
very
Celtic
I
declared
very
You
ascribe
to
me
a
Hamletic
quality
half-Hamlet
I
think
you
ironically
remarked
but
I
am
an
observer
enough
to
ask
you
whether
among
your
own
sex
there
are
not
half-Hamlets
quarter-Hamlets
You
have
known
so
many
among
mine
She
smiled
There
speaks
the
wounded
vanity
of
the
man
of
the
poet
You
remember
what
Heine
said
about
man
being
the
vainest
animal
and
the
poet
the
vainest
among
men
Yes
but
you
haven
t
answered
my
question
Are
you
too
a
half-Hamlet
Alas
to
be
a
woman
with
a
nomad
s
heart
in
me
she
quoted
Do
you
know
who
sang
that
Dora
Sigerson
loveliest
of
Neo-Irish
poets
I
a
feminine
half-Hamlet
Never
I
m
a
nomad
I
must
wander
or
suffocate
I
hate
the
stuffy
life
of
my
sex
The
indoor
sex
I
have
named
it
Oh
if
I
had
been
born
a
man
a
man
The
history
of
heroes
is
the
history
of
youth
That
s
Disraeli
What
would
you
do
if
you
were
a
man
I
eagerly
questioned
Make
love
to
pretty
women
like
all
of
them
Pouf
Is
that
the
only
ideal
of
man
No
I
should
write
great
poems
Her
voice
usually
muffled
in
timbre
rang
out
Where
is
the
nomad
you
spoke
of
a
moment
ago
To
be
a
poet
means
charming
one
s
spirit
to
the
ink-well
To
live
my
poems
of
course
She
was
almost
pettish
Then
with
a
gust
of
laughter
Saint-Hilary
entered
followed
by
the
others
His
face
was
red
and
his
enor
mous
frame
slightly
swayed
Evidently
Bernerville
had
something
stronger
than
Burgundy
Ah
there
you
are
again
my
boy
He
sees
two
of
me
I
muttered
And
no
doubt
entertaining
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
I
sup
pose
you
swapped
verses
She
is
a
poet
you
know
Now
Dottie
put
on
your
singing-robes
and
say
some
thing
nice
in
your
sweet
Irish
voice
Recite
one
of
your
own
poems
girlie
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
coldly
looked
at
him
but
did
not
reply
The
giant
went
to
her
sliding
across
the
highly
polished
floor
and
laughingly
took
her
by
the
wrists
Everyone
was
amused
at
his
persistence
except
myself
The
party
broke
up
Saint-Hilary
his
high
spirits
slain
by
the
disdainful
countenance
of
his
wife
bade
the
Bernervilles
a
glum
good-by
and
the
Prince
was
helped
down-stairs
to
his
carriage
by
polite
servants
Mrs
Bernerville
wasn
t
shocked
whispering
that
it
was
his
regular
evening
performance
Suave
and
mysterious
Bernerville
was
fresher
than
all
of
us
I
slipped
away
What
people
What
a
misspent
night
And
Mrs
Bernerville
had
not
failed
to
drop
a
last
depre
catory
word
about
Dorothea
Saint-Hilary
I
slowly
went
home
by
a
familiar
route
In
my
chambers
I
found
a
fire
dressing-gown
a
supply
of
tobacco
and
a
decanter
of
sherry
carefully
arranged
by
the
housekeeper
Now
I
ejaculated
is
the
time
to
enjoy
myself
I
made
myself
comfortable
and
getting
pen
and
paper
I
proceeded
to
manufacture
an
inventory
of
my
platonic
soul
a
practice
I
never
omitted
before
re
tiring
Many
ideas
crossed
my
mind
She
had
said
some
memorable
things
Why
did
she
manifest
such
interest
And
the
husband
Happy
with
such
a
man
Au
grand
jamais
I
looked
behind
me
in
the
shadows
Despite
my
agnosticism
I
experience
mystic
fear
when
alone
after
midnight
What
joy
in
the
reaches
of
the
gloomy
hour
when
the
vitality
is
at
its
lowest
ebb
and
the
hobgoblins
of
conscience
are
stirring
to
have
the
image
of
a
sympathetic
companion
beside
you
De
cidedly
some
men
don
t
deserve
their
happiness
And
lighting
a
cigar
I
resolutely
began
to
rewrite
the
eleventh
line
of
an
original
sonnet
in
French
Ill
Early
the
second
morning
I
went
out
I
had
not
left
my
rooms
since
my
return
from
the
Bernervilles
The
success
of
my
sonnet
I
had
finished
the
remaining
lines
before
I
went
to
bed
gave
my
muse
a
boost
In
one
evening
I
had
actually
written
three
sonnets
the
work
manship
of
which
was
not
indifferent
already
buzzed
in
my
head
the
scheme
of
a
sonnet-sequence
But
the
sharp
glorious
blue
of
the
sky
that
saluted
me
this
second
morning
speedily
drove
rhyming
from
my
thoughts
Hastily
swallowing
my
coffee
I
was
soon
striding
through
a
leafy
avenue
of
the
Pincio
garden
wondering
whether
life
was
not
after
all
worth
while
The
sweep
of
the
picture
Rome
beneath
the
misty
dream
of
a
poet
spurred
my
nerves
from
their
languor
I
traversed
the
outer
path
of
the
garden
as
far
as
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
and
was
hesitating
when
a
hand
was
placed
on
my
arm
Good
morning
Sir
Poet
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
What
luck
Only
a
moment
ago
I
was
thinking
of
you
What
a
fib
Your
eye
is
too
clear
for
a
man
that
has
been
indulging
in
retrospection
No
No
You
thought
what
a
wonderful
morning
it
is
You
said
to
yourself
you
were
glad
to
be
alive
lt
You
read
my
mind
like
a
gypsy
like
the
gypsy
you
are
I
feel
like
a
gypsy
this
morning
And
you
Not
like
a
half-Hamlet
Ah
That
phrase
sticks
It
doesn
t
fit
I
m
for
action
Let
s
walk
over
Rome
Merci
I
have
a
breakfast
engagement
with
Mr
Saint-Hilary
I
must
have
looked
so
displeased
that
she
smiled
one
of
her
smiles
of
half-pity
I
winced
I
was
a
mild
mark
for
her
wit
What
did
she
think
of
me
And
to
betray
my
jealousy
like
a
raw
boy
fresh
from
school
I
stiffened
my
spine
The
crisp
sunshine
painted
her
as
a
most
desirable
picture
If
we
are
to
be
friends
she
soberly
suggested
let
us
not
mind
the
pebbles
in
our
own
shoes
Because
you
feel
like
a
freed
balloon
to-day
you
fancy
that
the
cityful
should
rejoice
with
your
joy
How
like
a
poet
What
if
I
told
you
that
I
came
out
here
to
be
alone
so
utterly
miserable
am
I
What
would
you
say
That
I
don
t
believe
it
my
dear
Mrs
Saint
Hilary
I
ask
your
pardon
for
my
selfishness
I
feel
well
this
morning
and
manlike
I
wish
you
to
feel
the
same
Then
in
tremulous
anticipation
I
gazed
at
her
What
had
operated
on
my
spirits
to
liberate
such
emotions
Compared
with
this
minute
my
life
had
been
a-slumber
ing
To
my
scrutiny
she
seemed
more
buoyant
than
the
other
night
at
the
Bernervilles
I
endeavoured
to
grasp
the
secret
of
her
fleeting
expression
but
her
eyes
were
the
guardians
of
mute
treasures
they
had
no
message
for
me
I
suppressed
my
eagerness
I
determined
not
to
be
cajoled
into
self-betrayal
We
walked
in
the
direc
tion
of
the
Villa
Medici
We
did
not
enter
instead
turned
into
a
road
that
follows
the
curves
of
the
bridle
path
and
if
we
did
not
speak
our
brains
were
busy
build
ing
what
I
don
t
know
So
little
had
happened
to
me
so
little
of
value
that
I
could
not
help
pondering
the
possibilities
of
my
companion
s
career
There
was
she
walking
almost
touching
me
and
I
knew
no
more
about
her
soul
than
if
she
hailed
from
a
neighbouring
planet
I
had
grown
to
distrust
my
early
belief
that
women
were
easy
to
read
because
of
their
being
more
instinctive
than
men
and
therefore
wore
their
hearts
exposed
But
no
one
is
easy
to
read
men
no
more
than
women
Each
human
is
an
isolated
complex
of
organs
The
greatest
readers
of
the
human
heart
are
those
who
more
fully
than
others
interpret
themselves
Humility
itself
in
the
presence
of
my
new
friend
I
asked
myself
whether
I
could
seal
my
lips
so
effectually
that
she
might
seek
in
vain
for
my
secret
I
firmly
believed
it
to
be
a
secret
Suddenly
I
spoke
Let
us
talk
of
your
Celtic
poets
I
read
them
I
love
but
I
can
t
always
understand
them
She
turned
moist
eyes
towards
me
She
moved
my
heart
like
the
faint
sound
of
nocturnal
fountains
Ireland
is
all
my
life
When
I
m
there
I
m
unhappy
That
s
because
I
m
Irish
But
when
I
m
away
I
m
unhappy
and
that
is
Irish
too
Everything
about
her
seemed
to
live
the
flower
in
her
hair
was
faded
in
comparison
with
the
sparkle
in
her
flower-like
eyes
Her
smile
was
as
tricksy
as
the
new
moon
seen
through
flying
cloud-scud
I
was
delighted
I
had
come
out
with
an
unusual
fund
of
good
humour
and
here
I
was
expending
it
upon
my
companion
I
hardly
thought
of
myself
Truly
a
novel
refreshing
experience
for
an
egotist
She
was
conscious
that
she
puzzled
me
for
she
stopped
and
in
her
cheerful
every-day
voice
commanded
About
face
march
My
heart
beat
heavily
though
it
was
mid
day
and
the
sun
blazing
hot
for
October
the
air
seemed
cooler
Obeying
I
kept
in
rhythm
with
her
impetuous
gait
We
soon
passed
out
before
the
Piazzo
Margherita
She
signalled
a
negative
Then
at
last
to
the
Piazza
Barberini
No
She
would
say
good-by
at
the
church
I
looked
at
her
so
earnestly
that
she
coloured
Nothing
was
said
about
a
future
meeting
I
became
doleful
Ah
half-Hamlet
she
teasingly
protested
And
she
quickly
walked
along
the
Via
Sistina
Celt
I
cried
as
I
watched
her
graceful
swaying
figure
I
then
went
indoors
drank
tea
and
smoked
till
dinner-time
Oh
if
only
I
had
the
courage
at
the
moment
when
most
needed
To
be
a
thunderbolt
in
action
that
was
my
unrealised
ambition
But
a
half-Hamlet
That
night
at
the
Teatro
Costanzi
I
saw
a
play
by
D
Annunzio
a
violent
tragedy
related
in
the
golden
voice
of
the
poet
but
not
akin
to
my
mood
I
wished
myself
far
away
from
this
huge
theatre
sonorous
with
applause
I
left
before
the
culminating
act
and
paced
the
streets
The
moon
had
blotted
out
the
stars
and
like
a
silver
white
pyx
swung
in
the
firmament
there
was
a
cloud
shine
on
the
fleecy
boulders
that
nimbly
accompanied
it
through
the
blue
This
sky
incited
me
to
vague
hero
isms
yet
I
was
more
curious
about
the
look
of
Rome
in
the
moon-rays
so
ingrained
my
romantic
imagination
It
was
not
long
before
I
turned
off
the
Corso
The
Piazza
de
Spagna
was
deserted
not
even
a
carriage
disturbed
its
august
emptiness
The
moon
transposed
the
trees
of
the
Pincio
into
ebon
music
and
the
Spanish
Stairs
were
streaked
with
bars
of
light
As
I
neared
the
top
I
discerned
the
figure
of
a
woman
closely
hooded
who
recklessly
ran
down
the
steps
If
she
had
not
recoiled
as
she
passed
me
I
should
not
have
paused
to
look
at
her
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
She
went
on
taking
two
steps
at
a
time
So
swift
was
her
flight
that
instinctively
I
gazed
above
for
her
pursuer
I
saw
none
I
followed
her
but
not
far
the
encounter
had
unnerved
her
She
stopped
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
I
could
not
distin
guish
her
features
I
took
her
hand
and
found
it
icy
Dear
dear
lady
what
troubles
you
so
Are
you
ill
She
did
not
reply
I
could
feel
that
she
trembled
Let
me
bring
you
home
You
are
frightened
I
ll
ask
no
questions
It
is
not
well
for
you
to
be
out
alone
at
this
hour
I
sought
to
lead
up
the
stairs
She
snatched
her
hand
from
mine
No
no
not
that
way
Good
God
not
home
I
was
appalled
by
the
ex
travagant
misery
of
her
tone
Here
was
the
last
act
of
the
drama
I
had
not
sat
out
and
one
infinitely
more
poignant
than
the
fiction
of
the
Italian
poet
Without
artifice
was
the
soul
of
the
woman
bared
to
me
I
was
dumb
with
the
horror
of
my
imagining
What
else
could
have
driven
this
gentle
creature
out
on
the
streets
of
a
strange
city
what
else
but
I
ground
my
teeth
in
rage
My
phlegmatic
ego
dissolved
in
the
fire
of
her
sorrow
Like
a
flash
it
came
upon
me
I
loved
her
I
had
loved
her
from
the
first
And
she
had
been
driven
from
her
husband
by
reason
of
some
nameless
outrage
at
his
hands
Brute
I
uttered
a
hoarse
cry
and
gripped
her
Come
I
whispered
Come
I
ll
not
trouble
you
with
a
single
question
I
understand
everything
Come
with
me
up
the
stairs
There
is
refuge
for
you
at
the
hotel
I
ll
not
worry
you
with
my
company
She
regarded
me
with
blank
eyes
I
caught
their
inter
mittent
glint
When
she
spoke
her
voice
was
toneless
I
ll
go
with
you
but
you
must
take
me
to
my
home
In
the
Ludovisi
Quarter
You
ve
brought
me
to
my
senses
Don
t
dear
friend
set
me
down
as
a
mad
woman
I
was
crazy
There
was
provocation
It
s
past
I
ll
go
back
Forget
all
about
this
when
we
part
I
felt
moonstruck
my
personality
evaporating
This
was
our
farewell
the
end
of
my
brief
romance
She
would
go
back
to
the
man
she
loved
despite
his
bru
tality
The
reason
for
this
love
Whistle
down
the
wind
for
the
answer
I
brought
her
to
the
door
of
her
hotel
and
went
away
without
a
word
Twice
she
had
sent
me
from
her
once
playfully
and
now
in
sorrow
Celtic
she
was
She
had
the
cruel
heart
of
the
Celt
Was
the
music
in
her
worth
the
hearing
My
ill-luck
pursued
me
to
Venice
When
it
rains
in
Rome
there
are
the
palaces
the
picture-galleries
the
marbles
the
churches
but
at
Venice
the
meeting
of
the
waters
proves
doubly
monotonous
The
wet
of
the
canal
enters
the
soul
The
drippings
of
the
sky
are
as
the
eternal
tears
of
the
banished
gods
In
the
Ducal
Palace
sombre
dampness
dowers
with
humid
eyes
immemorial
portraits
Along
the
waterways
the
wind
howls
as
it
transfixes
the
wanderer
with
lance-like
thrusts
I
exe
crated
life
when
I
stepped
into
the
hotel
gondola
at
the
station
and
sat
shivering
and
propelled
through
the
desolate
darkness
of
narrow
waterways
where
murder
and
mystery
might
lurk
under
mean
flickering
gas-jets
The
melancholy
challenge
of
my
gondolier
failed
to
evoke
poetic
visions
of
nocturnal
Venice
I
was
glad
to
gain
the
steps
of
my
hotel
Everyone
was
congealed
by
the
cold
everything
saturated
with
the
rain
I
did
not
long
remain
in
my
apartment
Without
the
storm
drums
of
the
Adriatic
were
ruffling
the
shape
of
the
gale
was
lost
in
the
wrack
of
spilt
mist
At
Bauer-Grunwald
s
it
was
cheerful
the
most
cheer
ful
cafe
on
the
lagoons
Crowded
with
tourists
eating
drinking
smoking
talking
the
picture
appealed
to
me
because
of
its
human
quality
Nevertheless
I
was
home
sick
for
Rome
for
the
hospitable
if
tiresome
Berner
villes
the
Madame
with
her
teasing
chatter
her
hus
band
with
his
malicious
wit
Sick
too
though
in
another
way
for
the
sight
of
a
woman
s
face
What
an
ass
I
am
Very
well
garcon
I
ll
sit
at
this
table
First
give
me
the
wine-card
I
had
not
immediately
quitted
Rome
after
that
night
But
I
avoided
my
friends
I
wished
to
hear
no
gossip
I
could
surmise
without
being
boldly
told
that
unhappiness
camped
in
the
house
hold
of
the
Saint-Hilarys
After
a
week
the
city
became
intolerable
and
I
fled
to
Venice
where
it
rained
where
it
would
rain
forever
I
ordered
some
cold
meat
a
salad
a
bottle
of
Bordeaux
Then
relieved
of
the
head
waiter
s
presence
I
looked
about
me
Yes
those
visitors
from
the
world
over
were
practical
bad
weather
didn
t
daunt
them
And
then
my
roving
eye
took
in
a
man
who
sat
smiling
opposite
me
Affrightedly
I
clutched
my
knees
Was
I
dreaming
No
the
vision
was
too
real
too
burly
too
much
of
the
flesh
His
big
red
fist
ex
tended
Saint-Hilary
crossed
the
aisle
You
here
What
luck
I
thought
I
d
be
forced
to
put
in
an
inter
minable
evening
drinking
and
talking
to
the
waiter
I
tried
not
to
see
the
offered
hand
but
I
felt
it
as
it
squeezed
with
unaffected
vigour
my
thin
fingers
I
loathed
the
monster
I
had
expended
my
nervous
en
ergy
for
a
week
damning
him
and
here
he
was
but
why
in
Venice
And
alone
More
ill-luck
I
ve
been
drinking
a
lot
for
the
last
ten
days
Saint
Hilary
confessed
in
a
husky
voice
You
won
t
mind
will
you
You
re
a
good
chap
hard
to
make
out
I
m
in
a
heap
of
trouble
Let
me
bother
you
I
m
alone
Here
waiter
Fetch
my
glass
to
this
gentleman
s
table
Hurry
up
The
order
was
given
with
charac
teristic
energy
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
me
bidding
me
go
ahead
and
eat
my
supper
I
ll
be
all
right
soon
Sick
at
heart
I
swallowed
the
food
saw
dust
and
ashes
to
my
taste
After
some
wine
I
plucked
up
wit
enough
to
ask
Saint-Hilary
what
he
was
doing
away
from
Rome
Doing
I
ll
just
tell
you
my
boy
I
m
up
here
looking
for
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
for
my
wife
What
are
you
doing
here
may
I
ask
The
question
though
put
without
ill-temper
made
me
pale
Why
Mr
Saint-Hilary
I
only
arrived
an
hour
ago
on
the
morning
train
from
Rome
I
stammered
actually
feeling
guilty
I
know
it
my
boy
I
know
it
You
are
on
the
safe
side
but
a
little
soft
on
Dottie
all
the
young
painters
poets
composers
are
I
m
not
blaming
you
for
her
running
away
from
me
She
vamoosed
the
ranch
after
you
brought
her
back
from
the
Spanish
Stairs
She
told
you
I
struggled
not
to
appear
embarrassed
Yes
and
told
what
a
trump
you
were
You
behaved
like
a
gentleman
I
acted
like
a
brute
Don
t
scold
I
am
a
brute
When
I
accused
her
of
taking
too
much
interest
in
you
say
man
don
t
get
up
so
suddenly
my
nerves
are
all
taut
from
brandy
I
meant
no
offence
why
she
turned
on
me
like
a
tigress
Oh
She
has
a
sweet
temper
She
is
poetic
Such
a
talent
I
honestly
think
she
has
used
you
for
copy
Sit
down
You
can
t
go
away
now
and
leave
me
alone
I
ll
go
nutty
All
right
I
promise
to
say
nothing
more
I
m
to
blame
entirely
No
I
m
not
jealous
of
you
There
s
always
a
lot
of
chaps
hanging
around
her
skirts
I
wonder
how
she
keeps
from
mixing
up
their
schedules
I
simply
couldn
t
let
the
brandy
alone
Do
you
see
this
book
Have
you
read
it
He
handed
me
a
little
volume
bound
in
gold
and
green
I
recognised
it
Yes
I
answered
I
read
Meryona
on
the
train
It
s
ex
quisite
Who
wrote
it
Who
is
this
Rosa
Mystica
She
might
belong
to
the
new
group
of
Irish
writers
of
whom
your
wife
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
is
so
fond
I
was
puzzled
by
faint
echoes
of
Keats
George
Russell
I
was
only
too
glad
to
lead
the
conversation
into
a
different
channel
But
my
heart
was
a
lump
in
my
bosom
I
longed
to
hear
more
news
of
her
to
learn
the
cause
of
her
trouble
And
her
whereabouts
You
ll
never
learn
from
me
who
Rosa
Mystica
is
replied
Saint-Hilary
His
expansive
mood
had
vanished
In
a
halting
manner
he
read
paragraphs
from
the
book
paragraphs
of
rich
meanings
of
richer
prose
Nervous
as
he
was
he
exposed
in
trained
voice
the
densely
woven
patterns
of
this
new
prose
with
its
undertones
of
Celtic
sorrow
its
veiled
passion
rhythmic
pathos
mystical
overtones
and
its
wild
call
from
the
heart
of
Erin
Meryona
The
title
was
an
evocation
And
surely
no
man
could
have
written
it
Yes
my
boy
that
s
great
art
great
soul
Do
you
know
he
whispered
they
have
saddled
me
with
the
authorship
Even
Dottie
has
asked
me
the
question
asked
me
this
good
old
news
paper
hack
Have
a
drink
He
paused
I
paid
my
score
and
arose
Not
going
Listen
to
the
rain
on
the
roof
Stay
a
bit
I
return
to
Rome
early
in
the
morning
I
think
PII
find
Dottie
at
home
Lord
what
a
face
you
pull
Well
good
night
to
you
I
m
glad
I
met
you
If
you
ever
publish
anything
send
me
a
copy
and
I
ll
give
it
a
good
review
Where
are
you
stopping
I
hurried
away
I
would
have
struck
him
in
another
minute
that
is
what
I
said
to
myself
as
I
went
over
the
bridge
across
Campo
St
Moise
into
the
hotel
But
I
did
not
sleep
that
night
I
found
a
pencilled
card
in
the
morn
ing
It
told
that
he
hoped
to
see
me
in
Rome
soon
No
more
I
tore
it
up
and
went
for
coffee
It
still
rained
ferociously
I
ll
go
up
to
Milan
to-night
I
planned
At
least
I
can
hear
Duse
Here
I
asked
for
a
railway
guide
and
marked
down
my
train
It
would
leave
in
the
afternoon
I
breasted
the
wind
shrieking
through
the
Piazzetta
and
stumbled
along
the
Riva
degli
Schiavoni
I
could
hardly
see
Santa
Maria
della
Salute
for
the
grey
rain
that
came
obliquely
across
the
lagoon
titillating
the
shallow
waters
into
foam
The
Guidecca
was
a
nebulous
patch
And
the
sharp
salty
odours
that
were
abroad
in
the
air
set
me
dreaming
of
mid-ocean
Turning
off
the
unprotected
Riva
I
walked
at
hazard
arriving
on
the
Rio
della
Picta
There
I
found
the
Church
of
San
Giorgio
degli
Schiavoni
and
entered
more
for
protection
than
from
piety
In
front
of
Carpaccio
s
Saint
George
and
the
Dragon
I
saw
her
At
once
the
poorly
lighted
church
was
flooded
as
if
by
a
Turner
sunburst
Forgotten
the
wet
forgotten
Venice
forgotten
Saint-Hilary
with
his
odious
confidences
She
stood
there
in
devotional
attitude
before
the
mas
terpiece
I
almost
expected
her
to
kneel
in
prayer
as
she
had
knelt
that
first
day
in
the
cemetery
Then
the
lame
cicerone
who
sews
when
he
is
not
explaining
the
pictures
to
Ruskin-bewildered
tourists
spoke
to
me
Would
the
Signor
Inglese
care
to
look
My
threatening
expression
silenced
him
But
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
attracted
by
the
voices
she
turned
I
could
have
called
her
Blessed
as
in
an
unconcerned
manner
she
crossed
to
me
She
saved
me
a
wilderness
of
explanations
Suppose
we
go
to
the
hotel
she
remarked
in
her
accustomed
cool
tones
The
wind
twisted
our
umbrellas
and
beat
rain
into
our
faces
so
that
an
exchange
of
words
was
not
easy
An
idea
overtook
me
as
we
passed
the
gondolas
at
the
Piazzetta
I
shouted
in
her
ears
The
Giardino
Reale
Let
s
go
In
a
few
minutes
two
barelegged
men
were
fighting
as
inch
by
inch
they
slowly
paddled
their
craft
through
toppling
seas
It
was
a
daring
excursion
the
little
steamer
would
have
carried
us
more
safely
but
then
we
could
not
have
sat
so
intimately
as
in
the
gondola
Drenched
we
entered
the
picture-gallery
in
the
Royal
Gardens
and
stopped
to
breathe
we
soon
found
a
cafe
where
I
ordered
something
I
did
not
attempt
to
ask
questions
Her
grateful
eyes
rewarded
me
but
the
events
of
the
past
few
hours
were
telling
on
my
nerves
on
my
imagination
I
felt
bolder
than
in
Rome
The
woman
I
adored
was
with
me
apparently
contented
in
my
com
pany
And
how
lovely
she
looked
The
damp
air
had
set
burning
her
rich
Irish
complexion
Her
grey
eyes
enlarged
by
sorrow
did
not
avoid
my
gaze
Subtle
curves
were
in
her
smile
She
was
more
radiant
than
I
had
ever
seen
her
at
Rome
Emboldened
by
the
old
Chianti
I
exclaimed
I
m
so
happy
Dorothea
She
wider
opened
her
eyes
I
placed
my
hand
in
hers
I
m
so
happy
O
to
be
in
Venice
And
with
you
I
Hadn
t
we
better
return
to
the
hotel
she
asked
I
hesitated
The
man
who
hesitates
is
sometimes
saved
I
hope
you
will
pardon
my
crazy
tongue
I
m
only
telling
you
the
truth
How
I
supposed
since
that
night
She
interrupted
But
you
are
too
nervous
to
talk
You
have
not
said
anything
told
any
truth
and
you
must
not
I
am
alone
Be
my
friend
A
woman
alone
is
always
in
the
wrong
Here
is
the
waiter
Pay
him
and
let
me
go
Please
Despairingly
I
settled
We
went
into
the
gale
and
walked
crossing
slippery
marble
bridges
deserted
quays
and
to
the
howling
tune
of
the
wind
When
we
at
last
reached
the
Hotel
Danieli
she
bowed
her
head
and
entered
This
was
too
much
I
followed
and
in
the
salon
called
to
her
I
felt
myself
wilting
under
her
piercing
gaze
but
I
would
not
be
silenced
Listen
to
me
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
I
may
be
the
victim
of
an
artistic
vivisection
yet
in
Rome
when
you
were
with
your
husband
I
held
my
tongue
But
this
is
Venice
I
refuse
to
be
tortured
any
longer
Last
night
I
saw
him
saw
Saint-Hilary
She
started
then
blushed
hotly
Last
night
here
Here
I
persisted
He
told
me
all
I
defiantly
continued
though
I
knew
I
was
becoming
melodramatic
in
my
manner
He
told
me
all
I
know
who
wrote
Meryona
that
beautiful
book
Oh
Dorothea
you
wonderful
poet
how
can
you
endure
your
life
He
said
I
wrote
Mery
ona
No
not
exactly
He
said
that
he
had
been
credited
with
the
book
He
is
the
author
do
you
hear
me
My
husband
is
the
author
of
the
books
signed
Rosa
Mystica
She
was
a
blazing
sunset
She
fairly
glit
tered
in
her
wrath
I
don
t
believe
it
I
don
t
believe
it
You
must
believe
it
and
then
her
humour
changed
Now
sit
down
and
be
quiet
Let
us
think
the
matter
out
Bewildered
I
followed
her
movements
For
five
minutes
she
paced
the
room
I
could
hear
the
thumping
of
my
heart
I
ll
go
back
to
Rome
with
you
she
gravely
announced
her
eyes
narrowed
to
slits
her
voice
filed
to
a
provocative
murmur
Joyfully
I
sprang
towards
her
at
last
the
violin
had
vibrated
to
my
key-note
No
no
not
yet
The
silky
smile
of
her
set
me
crazy
Do
you
return
to
your
hotel
Come
for
me
in
an
hour
I
ll
be
ready
Happily
dismissed
I
rushed
back
to
my
room
packed
paid
my
bill
and
before
the
sixty
minutes
had
passed
I
was
again
at
the
Danieli
The
portier
solemnly
looked
at
me
The
lady
had
gone
away
half
an
hour
ago
Gone
Why
I
had
an
engagement
with
her
A
big
gentleman
called
a
few
minutes
after
you
left
soothingly
replied
the
fellow
as
he
held
out
his
hand
Her
husband
I
mechanically
cried
but
in
a
chilly
rage
determined
to
wear
a
brave
face
Oh
yes
her
husband
thank
you
Signor
With
women
the
unexpected
rules
I
rumi
nated
When
they
pipe
men
must
dance
and
once
I
had
believed
the
contrary
Life
is
very
different
from
books
As
the
train
traversed
the
interminable
bridge
I
looked
at
Venice
storm-begirt
sea
and
sky
in
watery
embrace
and
my
throat
choking
I
tried
to
hum
Oh
to
be
a
woman
and
a
nomad
s
heart
in
me
But
I
was
only
a
sentimental
comedian
and
soon
my
eyes
were
wet
like
Venice
What
had
I
done
what
had
I
said
I
often
asked
my
self
I
had
loved
a
woman
with
a
lyric
bird
nesting
in
her
bosom
neglected
by
a
coarse
husband
one
who
smirkingly
had
taken
upon
himself
the
honours
due
his
wife
I
have
since
noted
that
the
husband
of
the
woman
you
desire
is
always
coarse
though
on
closer
acquain
tance
he
is
very
nice
nicer
perhaps
than
his
misunder
stood
spouse
and
I
have
known
more
than
one
case
where
a
man
has
regretted
the
lost
friendship
of
a
man
in
exchange
for
the
doubtful
favours
of
the
woman
who
betrayed
him
Who
breaks
pays
And
I
had
not
been
allowed
to
tell
her
of
my
sincere
affection
under
the
sting
of
her
husband
s
indirect
revelations
and
the
wine
and
the
weather
curse
that
Chianti
I
had
whimpered
and
she
had
left
me
Had
she
not
throughout
our
brief
acquaintance
always
sent
me
away
from
her
Oh
what
an
ass
was
I
The
woman
had
never
ceased
loving
her
husband
not
even
when
ill-treated
And
I
fancied
I
understood
the
uneasy
sex
Oh
what
a
dolt
And
to
seek
her
love
in
such
a
hurried
style
like
a
train
that
must
be
overtaken
One
day
in
Paris
I
read
of
the
sudden
death
from
apoplexy
of
the
noted
writer
Lewis
Saint-Hilary
and
the
chronicles
were
full
of
the
past
doings
of
this
robust
worthy
who
in
addition
to
having
been
a
journalist
of
experience
unexpectedly
proved
to
be
the
author
of
Meryona
that
prose
epic
of
Erin
the
first
impulse
to
the
Neo-Celtic
renascence
I
rubbed
my
eyes
and
returned
to
Rome
There
I
did
not
find
the
Bernervilles
They
had
gone
to
Egypt
taking
with
them
Prince
Abbazia
whose
health
was
far
from
reassuring
the
sympathetic
Cameriere
added
that
Burgundy
and
brandy
were
poor
props
to
a
long
life
And
Madame
Saint-Hilary
Ah
He
threw
out
his
skinny
hands
palms
upwards
she
never
came
now
to
the
Palazzo
Barbarini
She
is
the
widow
of
a
distinguished
poet
addio
Signor
addio
Another
October
sun
slanted
its
yellow
glory
from
the
western
sky
as
I
entered
the
narrow
gate
of
the
Protestant
cemetery
which
still
wore
its
air
of
delicate
desolation
One
year
earlier
I
had
here
encountered
my
fate
the
first
woman
I
am
certain
who
understood
me
My
step
was
heavy
as
up
the
slope
I
went
to
the
remains
of
my
poets
Was
it
a
trick
of
memory
or
hallucination
that
pictured
for
me
a
kneeling
figure
but
at
a
newly
made
grave
not
Shelley
s
this
time
Increasing
my
speed
I
sprang
up
the
incline
She
did
not
turn
as
I
came
to
the
tomb
It
was
indeed
the
widow
of
Lewis
Saint
Hilary
garbed
in
green
and
so
immersed
in
her
medi
tations
that
I
feared
to
disturb
her
For
minutes
I
kept
silence
then
my
temperament
mastered
my
tongue
besides
the
colour
of
her
hair
worried
me
it
had
been
black
now
it
was
blonde
a
true
Botticellian
blonde
The
change
made
me
doubly
curious
Dorothea
I
softly
called
Dorothea
She
did
not
move
Do
you
know
who
is
speaking
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
I
con
tinued
my
courage
oozing
through
the
very
cadences
of
my
voice
I
know
yes
Won
t
you
see
me
again
This
imploringly
She
sternly
replied
No
Is
this
is
this
all
All
and
compressed
in
the
answer
was
the
Venice
of
our
last
day
cold
rainy
charmless
Stung
to
the
centre
of
my
dearest
vanity
I
left
her
For
me
she
was
a
cracked
fiddle
She
was
married
to
the
memory
of
her
dead
a
spiritual
Suttee
With
a
final
gesture
I
bade
my
hopes
take
flight
It
was
the
first
brave
act
in
my
irresolute
life
As
I
passed
through
the
portal
of
the
cemetery
I
felt
like
a
man
who
had
at
last
escaped
the
burdens
of
a
corroding
conscience
If
marriage
depended
alone
on
woman
how
long
would
the
institution
endure
For
years
the
literary
world
was
startled
by
posthumous
works
of
the
late
fecund
and
brilliant
Lewis
Saint
Hilary
His
widow
proved
an
admirable
editor
of
the
deceased
man
s
manuscripts
Epical
and
dramatic
lyric
pathetic
saturated
with
patriotism
and
wistful
poesy
the
note
of
the
Gaelic
race
these
books
in
verse
and
prose
set
us
all
wondering
why
we
had
so
underestimated
the
powers
of
Saint-Hilary
Even
his
wife
had
called
him
lazy
Parallel
cases
may
be
remembered
with
the
widows
of
a
celebrated
French
historian
and
of
an
Englishman
who
wrote
so
significantly
about
Gaelic
lore
both
the
wid
ows
edited
posthumous
works
and
the
Frenchwoman
s
devotion
was
so
great
so
it
has
been
rumoured
that
she
outran
her
prudence
and
wrote
some
books
herself
but
that
s
stale
literary
gossip
Certainly
Mrs
Saint-Hilary
did
not
write
Meryona
She
told
me
so
And
yet
I
often
think
that
if
Dorothea
had
but
realised
the
golden
opportunity
she
lost
when
she
refused
to
transform
a
half
Hamlet
into
a
singing
poet
and
do
for
the
living
what
she
accomplished
for
the
dead
perhaps
I
might
have
mastered
my
emotional
reticence
perhaps
But
why
psy
chologically
speaking
did
she
become
a
Botticellian
blonde
Did
she
have
the
feminine
thirst
for
a
second
submission
That
is
a
more
provocative
and
fascinating
enigma
than
the
disputed
authorship
of
Meryona
CODA
And
now
it
is
time
to
ring
down
the
final
curtain
on
the
show
I
might
go
on
tapping
new
levels
of
energy
to
use
the
striking
phrase
of
William
James
but
to
what
purpose
Life
is
like
an
onion
You
may
peel
off
layer
after
layer
until
you
reach
the
core
and
then
there
is
nothing
So
could
I
skin
my
little
symphony
in
which
there
has
been
more
dissonance
than
har
mony
and
enumerate
my
leading-motives
my
medi
ocrity
my
resigned
attitude
as
a
contemporary
my
steeplejackism
I
am
still
an
impenitent
steeplejack
and
hope
to
die
with
my
boots
on
my
disgust
with
Barmecide
banquets
my
vanity
selfishness
and
ego
tism
my
mannerisms
limitations
my
many
sins
of
omission
and
commission
including
my
regrets
for
girls
unkissed
my
garrulity
discursiveness
and
vice
of
allusiveness
the
list
might
be
made
much
longer
only
you
must
be
weary
of
the
personal
pronoun
stitched
in
the
palimpsest
of
my
adventure
The
truth
is
seldom
amusing
and
my
velleities
too
often
graze
the
fantastic
But
you
may
put
your
hand
in
this
rag-bag
of
mine
and
pull
out
a
quotation
worth
remembering
indeed
this
may
be
critically
judged
from
the
protasis
to
the
catas
trophe
as
a
book
of
beautiful
quotations
Fancy
if
I
had
followed
the
pattern
of
Dostoievsky
and
devoted
several
hundred
thousand
words
to
one
day
s
happenings
in
life
It
is
at
least
a
negative
virtue
that
I
did
not
do
this
Other
ears
other
songs
I
forgot
my
belief
in
a
personal
devil
as
a
leading-motive
that
devil
who
could
say
in
jocular
accents
for
he
is
a
sound
Latinist
even
if
he
likes
to
twist
a
text
to
suit
his
diabolic
purpose
Sathanas
sum
et
nihil
humanum
a
me
K
B
i
puto
After
that
Terence
may
go
bug
And
don
t
forget
the
devil
is
a
believer
The
genesis
of
these
avowals
was
simple
gmwgfc
My
editor
wagered
me
that
I
could
write
them
and
I
wagcicd
him
I
could
not
I
lost
but
as
nothing
was
ft
he
too
lost
It
was
galley-slave
work
as
not
a
line
was
written
till
May
15
1918
Yet
not
altogether
an
un
pleasant
task
And
finished
in
exactly
fifteen
weeks
written
with
a
pen
As
I
once
said
to
Theodore
Presser
How
happy
we
were
in
the
days
when
we
were
starving
I
And
the
mighty
maw
of
the
printing-press
engulfing
copy
by
the
mile
I
often
felt
like
that
Russian
peasant
who
chased
by
a
bear
finally
reached
his
house
swimming
the
last
mile
happy
exhausted
but
per
spiring
rivers
I
have
covered
a
period
of
at
least
fifty
years
Need
I
tefl
you
that
my
cosmopolitan
sin
peeled
off
like
dry
paint
from
a
cracked
wall
when
President
Wil
son
proclaimed
our
nation
at
war
I
shall
never
forget
the
amazed
expression
of
Colonel
Roosevelt
as
I
admitted
that
I
was
in
Paris
when
I
attained
my
majority
and
did
not
cast
a
vote
in
our
presidential
election
And
be
was
justified
in
his
gesime
of
disapproval
cosmopoli
tanism
is
all
very
well
for
the
dilettante
but
for
a
young
man
on
the
threshold
of
life
h
is
sometimes
deadly
poison
Our
country
first
This
is
a
fighting
planet
Pacificism
is
a
pipe-dream
The
Lord

a
man
of

Tofle

After

behind

Yeais
ago
I
lived
in
the
Impasse
du
Maine
on
the
left
bank
Paris
Every
morning
I
was
annoyed
because
awakened
by
piano-playing
evidently
that
of
a
mediocre
amateur
some
amateurs
are
not
mediocre
I
asked
that
handy
busybody
of
all
work
the
concierge
if
he
knew
the
name
of
the
relentless
pianist
Ah
that
is
M
le
Comte
He
is
very
old
and
is
spend
ing
his
time
pleasantly
before
he
dies
Later
I
saw
M
le
Comte
White
of
beard
spry
for
an
octogenarian
his
muscles
still
capable
of
pounding
he
seemed
far
from
the
end
of
every
man
s
desire
The
words
of
the
con
cierge
now
made
their
appeal
to
me
He
is
spending
his
time
pleasantly
before
he
dies
Can
you
think
of
anything
more
reasonable
He
played
cards
no
doubt
did
M
le
Comte
and
went
to
his
pet
cafe
to
sip
coffee
smoke
and
read
the
newspaper
stuffed
with
his
favourite
prejudices
But
the
main
business
of
the
day
was
his
hour
at
the
keyboard
The
music
must
have
made
his
rusty
old
bones
sweeter
I
recall
that
he
always
finished
with
the
Souvenir
de
Kiev
by
a
Bo
hemian
composer
a
friend
of
Chopin
Jules
Schulhoff
There
was
a
prodigious
amount
of
bang
and
clatter
and
then
the
old
nobleman
who
probably
remembered
Louis
Philippe
would
saunter
forth
in
his
buttonhole
a
rose
a
malacca
cane
jauntily
switching
the
earth
I
envied
this
serene
sunset
of
a
long
useless
and
no
doubt
troubled
existence
Who
wrote
It
is
wonderful
what
one
ray
of
sunshine
can
do
for
the
soul
of
man
Music
was
this
old
chap
s
sunshine
I
can
t
play
cards
or
billiards
I
can
t
read
day
and
night
I
take
no
interest
in
the
chess-board
of
politics
and
I
am
not
too
pious
What
shall
I
do
Music
always
music
There
are
certain
compositions
by
my
beloved
Chopin
to
master
which
eternity
itself
would
not
be
too
long
That
last
page
of
the
Second
Ballade
as
Anton
Rubinstein
played
it
in
apocalyptic
thunder
tones
Or
the
study
in
double-thirds
rippled
off
by
the
velvety
fingers
of
de
Pachmann
I
once
more
place
the
notes
on
the
piano-desk
Courage
Time
is
fuga
cious
How
many
years
have
I
not
played
that
magic
music
Music
the
flying
vision
music
that
merges
with
the
tender
air
its
image
melts
in
shy
misty
shadows
the
cloud
the
cloud
the
singing
shining
cloud
over
the
skies
and
far
away
the
beckon
ing
cloud
