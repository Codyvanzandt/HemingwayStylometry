people travel on business, some in search
of health. But it Is neither the sickly nor the
men of affairs who fill the Grand Hotels and
the pockets of their proprietors. It is those
who travel * for pleasure/ as the phrase goes.
What Epicurus, who never travelled except
when he was banished, sought in his own gar-
den, our tourists seek abroad. And do they find
their happiness ? Those who frequent the places
where they resort must often find this question,
with a tentative answer in the negative, fairly
forced upon them. For tourists are, in the main,
a very gloomy-looking tribe. I have seen much
brighter faces at a funeral than in the Piazza of
St. Mark's. Only when they can band together
and pretend, for a brief, precarious hour, that
they are at home, do the majority of tourists look
really happy. One wonders why they come
abroad.

The fact is that very few travellers really like
travelling. If they go to the trouble and expense
of travelling, it is not so much from curiosity,
for fun, or because they like to see things beauti-
ful and strange, as out of a kind of snobbery.
People travel for the same reason as they collect

works of art: because the best people do it To
have been to certain spots on the earth's surface
Is socially correct; and having been there, one
is superior to those who have not Moreover,
travelling gives one something to talk about when
one gets home. The subj ects of conversation are
not so numerous that one can neglect an oppor-
tunity of adding to one's store.

To justify this snobbery5 a series of myths has
gradually been elaborated. The places which
it is socially smart to have visited are aureoled
with glamour, till they are made to appear, for
those who have not been there, like so many
fabled Babylons or Bagdads. Those who have
travelled have a personal interest in cultivating
and disseminating these fables. For if Paris and
Monte Carlo are really so marvellous as it is
generally supposed, by the inhabitants of Bradford
or Milwaukee, of Tomsk and Bergen, that they
are�why3 then3 the merit of the travellers who
have actually visited these places is the greater,
and their superiority over the stay-at-homes the
more enormous. It is for this reason (and be-
cause they pay the hotel proprietors and 'the
steamship companies) that the fables are studi-
ously kept alive.

Few things are more pathetic than the "spec-

4
WHY NOT STAY AT HOME?
tacle of Inexperienced travellers, brought up on
these myths, desperately doing their best to make
external reality square with fable. It is for the
sake of the myths and, less consciously, in the
name of snobbery that they left their homes 5 to
admit disappointment in the reality would be to
admit their own foolishness in having believed
the fables and would detract from their merit
in having undertaken, the pilgrimage. Out of
the hundreds of thousands of Anglo-Saxons who
frequent the night-clubs and dancing-saloons of
Paris, there are a good many, no doubt, who
genuinely like that sort of thing. But there are
also very many who do not. In their hearts,
secretly, they are bored and a little disgusted,
But they have been brought up to beiieve in a
fabulous * Gay Paree,' where everything is de-
liriously exciting and where alone it is possible to
see what is technically known as Life. Con-
scientiously, therefore, they strive, when they
come to Paris, to be gay. Night after night
the dance halls and the bordellos are thronged
by serious young compatriots of Emerson and
Matthew Arnold, earnestly engaged in trying to
see life, neither very steadily nor whole, through
the ever-thickening mists of Heidsieck and
Roederer.
ALONG, THE ROAD
Still more courageously determined are their
female companions i for they, mostly (unless they
are extremely * modern ?)5 have not the Roederer
to assist them in finding Paris gay. The saddest
sight I ever saw was in a Montmartre botte at
about �ve o'clock of an autumn morning. At a
table in a corner of the hail sat three young
American girls, quite unattended, adventurously
seeing life by themselves. In front of them, on
the table, stood the regulation bottles of cham-
pagne 5 but for preference�perhaps on principle
�they were sipping lemonade. The jazz band
played on monotonously 5 the tired drummer
nodded over his drums, the saxophonist yawned
into his saxophone. In couples, in staggering
groups, the guests departed. But grimly, indom-
itably, in spite of their fatigue, in spite of the bore-
dom which so clearly expressed itself on their
charming and ingenuous faces, the three young
girls sat on. They were still there when I left at
sunrise. What stories, I reflected, they would
tell when they got home again ! And how en-
vious they would make their untravelled friends.
6 Paris is just wonderful. . . .*

To the Parisians, the fable brings in several
hundred milliards of good money. They give it
a generous publicity ; business is business. But

6
WHY NOT STAY AT HOME?
if I were the manager of a Montmartre dancing-
saloon^ I think I should tell my waiters to act
their gay parts with a little more conviction. & My
men/ I should say to them5 i you ought to look as
though you believed in the fable out of which
we make our living. Smile? be merry. Your
present expression3 which is a mingling of weari-
nesSj disgusted contempt for your clients and
cynical rapacity, is not inspiring. One day the
clients might be sober enough to notice it And
where should we be then ? *

But Paris and Monte Carlo are not the only
resorts of pilgrimage. There are also Rome and
Florence. There are picture galleries^ churches
and ruins as well as shops and casinos. And the
snobbery which decrees that one must like Art�
or5 to be more accurate^ that one should have
visited the places where Art is to be seen�is
almost as tyrannous as that which bids one visit
the places where one can see Life.

All of us are more or less interested Jn Life�
even in that rather smelly slice of it that is to be
found in Montmartre. But a taste for Art�or
at any rate the sort of art that is found in galleries
and churches�is by no means universal. Hence
the'case of the poor tourists who, from motives of
snobbery^ visit Rome and Florence, is even more
ALONG  THE   ROAD

pathetic than the case of those who repair for
the same reasons to Paris and Monte Carlo.
Tourists & doing * a church wear a mask of dutiful
interest j but what lassitude, what utter weari-
ness of spirit looks out, too often, at their eyes !
And the weariness is felt, within, still more
acutely because, precisely, of the necessity of
simulating this rapt attentiveness, of even going
hypocritically into raptures over the things that
are starred in the Baedeker. There come
moments when flesh and blood can stand the
strain no longer. Philistinism absolutely refuses
to pay the tribute it owes to taste. Exasperated
and defiant, the tourist swears that he won't so
much as put his nose inside another church, pre-
ferring to spend his days in the lounge of the hotel,
reading the continental Daily MaiL

I remember witnessing one of these rebellions
at Venice. A motor boat company was advertis-
ing afternoon excursions to the island of Torcello.
We booked our seats and at the appointed time
set off, in company with seven or eight other
tourists. Romantic in its desolation, Torcello
rose out of the lagoon. The boatmen drew up
at the side of a mouldering jetty. A quarter of
a mile away, through the fields, stood the church-
It contains some of the most beautiful mosaics in
8
WHY NOT STAY AT HOME?
Italy. We climbed on shore�all of us with the
exception of one strong-minded American couple
who, on learning that the object of interest on
this island was only another church, decided to
remain comfortably seated in the boat till the
rest of the party should return. I admired them
for their firmness and their honesty. But at the
same time, it seemed to me rather a melancholy
thing that they should have come all this way and
spent all that money, merely for the pleasure of
sitting in a motor boat tied to a rotting wharf.
And" then they were only at Venice. Their
Italian ordeal had hardly begun. Padua, Ferrara,
Ravenna, Bologna, Florence, Siena, Perugia,
Assisi and Rome, with all their innumerable
churches and pictures, had still to be looked at,
before�the blessed goal of Naples finally reached
�they could be permitted to take the liner home
again across the Atlantic. Poor slaves, I thought;
and of how exacting a master !

We call su^h people travellers because they do
not stay at home. But they are not genuine
travellers, not travellers born. For they travel^
not for travelling's sake? but for convention's.
They set out, nourished on fables and fantastical
hopes, to return, whether they avow it or not,
disappointed. Their interest in the real and
ALONG THE ROAD
actual being insufficiently lively, they hanker
after mythology/and the facts, however curious,
beautiful and \-aried, are a disillusionment. It is
only the society of their fellow-tourists, with
whom they conspire, every now and then, to
make a little oasis of home in the foreign wilder-
ness, coupled with the consciousness of a social
duty done, that keeps them even moderately
cheerful in the face of the depressing facts of
travel

Your genuine traveller, on the other hand, is
so much interested in real things that he does not
find it necessary to believe in fables. He is in-
satiably curious, he loves what is unfamiliar for
the sake of its unfamiliarity, he takes pleasure in
every manifestation of beauty. It would be ab-
surd, of course, to say that he is never bored.
For it is practically impossible to travel without
being sometimes bored. For the tourist3 a large
part of almost every day is necessarily empty.
Much time, to begin with, must be spent in
merely getting from place to place. And when
the sights have been seen, the sight-seer finds him-
self physically weary and with nothing particular
to do* At home, among one's regular occupa-
tions, one is never bored. Ennui is essentially a
holiday feeling. (Is it not the chronic disease

10
WHY NOT STAY AT HOME?
of the leisured ?) It is for that very reason that
your true traveller finds boredom rather agree-
able than painful. It is the symbol of his liberty
�his excessive freedom. He accepts his bore-
dom, when it comes5 not merely philosophically,
but almost with pleasure.

For the born traveller, travelling is a besetting
vice. Like other vices it is imperious, demand-
ing its victim's time? money, energy and the
sacrifice of his comfort. It claims s and the born
traveller gives, willingly, even eagerly. Most
vices, it may be added parenthetically, demand
considerable self-sacrifices. There is no greater
mistake than to suppose that a vicious life is a life
of uninterrupted pleasure. It is a life almost as
wearisome and painful�if strenuously led�as
Christian's in The Pilgrim5s Progress. The chief
difference between Christian and the vicious man
is that the first gets something out of his hardships
�gets it here and now in the shape of a certain
spiritual well-being, to say nothing of what he
may get in that sadly problematical Jerusalem
beyond the river�while the second gets nothing,
except, perhaps^ gout and general paralysis of the
insane.,

The vice of travelling, it is true, does not neces-
sarily bring with it these two particular diseases 5

U
ALONG   THE   ROAD

nor indeed any diseases at all, unless your wander-
Ings take you as far as the tropics. No bodily
diseases 5 for travelling is not a vice of the body
(which it mortifies) but of the mind. Your
traveller-for-travellingVsake is like your desul-
tory reader�a man addicted to mental self-in-
/

diligence.

Like all other vicious men, the reader and the
traveller have a whole armoury of justifications
with which to defend themselves. Reading and
travelling, they say, broaden the mind, stimulate
imagination, are a liberal education. And so on.
These are specious arguments 5 but nobody is
very much knpressed by them. For though it
may be quite true that, for certain people, de-
sultory reading and aimless travelling are richly
educative, it is not for that reason that most true
readers and travellers born indulge their tastes.
We read and travel, not that we may broaden and
enrich our minds, but that we may pleasantly
forget they exist. We love reading and travel-
ling because they are the most delightful of all
the many substitutes for thought. Sophisticated
and somewhat rarefied substitutes. That is why
they are not every man's diversion. The con-
genital reader or traveller is one of those more
fastidious spirits who cannot find the distractions
12
WHY  NOT   STAY AT  HOME?
they requiire in betting, mah-jongg, drink, golf
or fox-trots,

There exist a few, a very few, who travel and5
for that matter, who read, with purpose and a
definite system. This is a morally admirable
class. And it is the class to which, in general,
the people who achieve something in the world
belong. Not always, however,, by any means.
For,, alas5 one may have a high purpose and a fine
character but no talent. Some of the most self-
indulgent and aimless of travellers and readers
have known how to profit by their vices. De-
sultory reading was Dr. Johnson's besetting sin 5
he read every book that came under his hand and
none to the end. And yet his achievement y^as
not small. And there are frivolous travellers,
like Beckford, who have gone about the world,
indulging their wanton curiosity, to almost as
good purpose. Virtue is its own reward ; but
the grapes which talent knows how to pluck�
are they not a little sour ?

With me, travelling is frankly a vice. The
temptation to indulge in it is one which I find
almost as hard to resist as the temptation to read
promiscuously, omnivorously and without pur-
pose. From time to time, it is true, I make a
desperate resolution to mend my ways. I sketch
ALONG  THE   ROAD

out programmes of useful^ serious reading 5 I try
to turn my rambling voyages into systematic tours
through the history of art and civilization. But
without much success. After a little I relapse
into my old bad ways. Deplorable weakness !
1 try to comfort myself with the hope that even
my vices may be of some profit to me.

14
WANDER-BIRDS

JP AIR-HAIRED, bare-headed, with faces burned
darker than their hair, they trudge along the
dusty roads.    They wear shorts 5 their Tyrolean
knees are brown.    Enormous boots, heavy with
nails, click metallically over the flagstones of the
churches into which, conscientious Kunstforschers^
they penetrate.   On their backs they carry knap-
sacks and in their hands, sometimes a stick, some-
times a stout umbrella ; I have seen them making
the ascent of the Viale dei Colli at Florence with
ice-axes.    They are the wander-birds, and they
come, as their name (so romantic and applied so
unironically), their Schillerian name too mani-
festly proclaims, from Germany.    Many of them
have walked all the way, across the Alps from
Berlin to Taranto and back, with no money,
living on bread and water, sleeping in barns or by
the roadside.   Adventurous and hardy youths!   I
feel the profoundest admiration for them. J even
envy them, wishing that I possessed their energy,
their hardiness.    But I do not imitate them.
,*Tlie saints of old/ says the Kymnologist, *went

up to Heaven
With sorrow, toil and pain.
Lord, unto us may strength be given
To follow in tie train.'
ALONG THE ROAD
For me, I confess5 even the train has become a
means of travelling too inconvenient to be much
employed, I would amend the last two lines of
the hymn to, * Lord5 unto us may wealth be given
to follow in the car.' The prayer has been
granted�partially, at any rate ; for whether a
ten-horse-power Citroen can really be called a
car is questionable. Owners of Napiers5 Vaux-
halls, Delages or Voisins, would certainly deny
it. 1 shall not argue the point. All I claim for
the ten-horse-power Citroen is this : that it
works. In a modest and unassuming way, not
very rapidly, indeed, but steadily and reliably, it
takes one about. This particular specimen has
carried us a good many thousand miles over the
roads of Italy, France, Belgium and Holland | '
which, for all who are acquainted with those
road% is saying a good deal.

At this point, if I had any strength of mind, I
should stop talking about Citroens and return to
higher themes. But the temptation of talking
about cars, when one has a car, is quite irresistible.
Before I bought a Citroen no subject had less
interest for me j none, now, has more. I can
talk for hours about motors with other car-owners.
Arid I am ruthlessly prepared to bore the non-
motorist by talking interminably of this delightful

16
WANDER-BIRDS

subject .even to him. I waste much precious
time reading the motoring papers, study passion-
ately the news from the racing trackss gravely
peruse technical lucubrations which I do not
understand. It is a madness3 but a delightful one.
The spiritual effects of being a car-owner are
not, I notice, entirely beneficial. Introspection
and the conversation of other motorists have
shown me, indeed, that car-owning may have the
worst effect on the character. To begin with
every car-owner is a liar. He cannot tell the
truth about his machine. He exaggerates his
speed, the number of miles he goes to the gallon
of petrol, his prowess as a hill climber. In the
heat of conversation I myself have erred in this
respect, more than once 5 and even coolly, with
malice aforethought, I have given utterance, on
this subject, to frigid and calculated lies. They
do not weigh very heavily on my conscience, I
am no casuist, but it seems to me that a lie which
one tells, expecting nobody to believe it, is venial.
The motorist, like the fisherman, never really
supposes that his vaunts will be believed! Myself,
I have long ceased to give the slightest credit to
anything my fellow-motorists may tell me. My
last vestige of confidence was destroyed by the
Belgian driver who told me that two hours were

B                             17
ALONG  THE  ROAD

ample time to allow for the journey from Brussels
to Ostend ; he himself, he declared3 did it con-
stantly and never took more. I trusted him and
did not consult the road book. If I had,1 should
have found that the distance from Brussels to
Ostend is something over seventy miles, that the
road is cobbled all the way and badly cobbled at
that, and that one has to pass through three large
towns and about twenty villages. As it was we
started late in the afternoon and were hopelessly
benighted. Now, when motorists tell me how
long it takes them to get from one place to
another, I add on, according to their character,
from thirty to sixty per cent, to the figure they
mention. In this way I reach approximate
truth.

Another horrible sin encouraged by the owning
of an automobile, particularly of a small auto-
mobile, is envy. What bitter discontentment
fills the mind of the 10 H.P. man as the 40 H.P.
shoots silently past him! How fiercely he
loathes the owner of the larger machine ! What
envy and covetousness possess him I In a flat
country one envies less than in a hilly. For on
the flat even the little car can do quite creditably
enough to keep up its owner's self-esteem. It is
in a mountainous country, like Italy, where the

18
WANDER-BIRDS

roads are constantly running up to two or three
thousand feet and down again5 that the deadly sin
of envy really flourishes. For there the little car
must abjectly acknowledge its littleness. The
superiority of 40 H.P. over 10 H.P. is only too
painfully apparent. It was on the Mont Cenis
that the cup of our humiliation flowed over and
the blackest envy filled our souls. We had
started from Turin. For the first thirty miles
the road is perfectly flat. We rolled along it in
very dashing style 5 the smaller Fiats ate our dust.
In front of us3 like an immense uneven wall, the
Alps rose suddenly out of the plain. Susa lies at
the head of a long flat-bottomed valley that leads
into the heart of the hills. You pass through the
town and then^ suddenly, without warning, the
road begins to climbs steeply. It goes on climb-
ing without respite for the next fifteen miles.
The top of the pass is six thousand five hundred
feet above the sea. The Citroen went into
second and remained there j slowly we puffed up
the long ascent. We had gone about a mile5
when we became aware of a noise coming up
from the valley, a noise like the noise of massed
machine-guns. It grew louder and louder. A
minute later a huge red Alfa Romeo road racer,
looking suspiciously like the machine that had

19
ALONG  THE  ROAD

just won the Grand Prix of Europe, roared past
at a speed that cannot have been less than fifty-
miles an hour. It was evidently being driven by
a genius j for, looking up, we saw the scarlet
monster negotiating turn after hairpin turn in the
zigzag road above us without once abating its
speed by a mile an hour. In another thirty
seconds it was out of sight. The noise of it
solemnly reverberated among the mountains, like
thunder, , Slowly we puffed on. Half an hour
later we met the red terror descending ; round
the corners it showed the same disregard for the
elementary laws of dynamics as it had shown on
the way up. We imagined that we had seen the
last of it. But waiting at the Italian custom-
house while the officer in charge examined our
papers�a process which, as at all custom-houses>
took a very long time�we heard, far * off, a
familiar sound. In a few minutes the sound be-
came deafening. Like a huge red rocket, trailing
behind it a cloud of smoke, the Alfa Romeo
passed at the head of its white dust. 4 They Ye
doing hill-climbing tests,* the soldier on guard
explained. We set out once more. The cus-
tom-house is only half-way up the hill; we had
another three thousand feet or so before, we
reached the summit Slowly^ on second, we,

20
WANDER-BIRDS

addressed ourselves to the ascent. We were only
a mile from the custorn-house5 when5 for the
second time, we met the Alfa Romeo descending.
It disappeared, carrying with it a load of hatred^
envy and mixed uncharitableness of every variety.

The road mounted and mounted. We passed
through the region of pine woods. Around and
above us3 now, the slopes were bare | quite close,
among the nearer summits, across the valley3 were
patches of snow. For all that the season was
sumrner3 the air -was uncommonly sharp and
nipping. A wind blew j In the shade it was
positively cold. But that did not prevent the
car from boiling.

The hospice and the hotels of the Mont Cenis
stand on the shores of a lake in the middle of a
little plateau that lies, a miracle of flatness amid
the surrounding perpendicularity. Towards the
Italian side this shelf among the hills ends ab-
ruptly in what is nearly a precipice. For the
last four or five hundred feet the road leading up
to it is terraced out of the rock and rises with
uncommon steepness. We were half-way up
these final zigzags, when all at once, bursting
with a roar round the corner of a bluff that had
muffled the sound of its approach, the scarlet
Alfa Romeo appeared at the bottom of the preci-

21
ALONG   THE   ROAD

pice up which we were painfully zigzagging.
It came up after us5 like a wild beast pursuing Its
prey, bellowing. Just as we reached the top3 the
monster overhauled us5 passed and went racing
across the plain. Our humiliation was complete.
Envy and discontent boiled up within us5 like the
water boiling in the radiator of our miserable
little machine, 6 If only/ we said? fi if only we
had a real car. . . .* We longed to exchange the
passion of envy for the equally malignant and
un-Christian passions of pride and contempt, to
be those who pass exultantly instead of those who
are passed. * Yea, also the heart of the sons of
men is full of evi!3 and madness is In their heart
while they live, and after that they go to the dead.5
When we reached the hotel, the Alfa Romeo
had turned round and was just preparing to begin
its third descent * It's an ugly-looking car/ we
said.

Such are the moral consequences of being
the owner of a small car. We tried to reason
with ourselves. 4 After all/ we said? * this little
machine has done good service. It has taken us
over bad roads5 up and down enormous hills,
through a variety of countries. It has taken us,
not merely through space3 across the face of the
map,, but through time�from epoch to epoch�

22
WANDER-BIRDS

through art, through many languages and cus-
toms, through philology and anthropology. It
has been the instrument of great and varied
pleasures. It costs little, behaves well, its habits
are as regular as those of Imuianuel Kant. In its
unpretentious way it is a model of virtue.' All
this we said, and much more ; and it was com-
forting. But in the bottom of our hearts envy
and discontent still lurked, like coiled serpents,
ready to raise their heads the very next time that
forty horses should pass us on a hill.

It may be objected that the small-car owner is
not alone in envying. The wander-birds doing
their four miles an hour, sweating, up the dusty
hill, must envy indiscriminately both the ten and
the forty horse-power man. True, some of them
probably do. But it must not be forgotten that
there are pedestrians who walk because they
genuinely prefer walking to being carried effort-
lessly along by a machine. In my youth I used
to try to pretend that I preferred walking to other
means of locomotion. But I soon found that it
was not true. For a little time I was one of those
hypocrites of country heartiness (and they are
quite numerous) who tramp and drink ale in little
inns, because it is the right thing to do. In the
end, however, I frankly admitted to myself and
ALONG  THE   ROAD

to other people that 1 was not one of nature's
walkers, that I did not like hearty exercise and
discomfort, and did not mean any longer to pre-
tend that I did But 1 still have the greatest
respect for those who do, and 1 consider that they
are probably a superior type of humanity to the
idle and comfort-loving breed predominant at the
present time. One of the great charms of mech-
anical progress is that it allows us to do every-
thing quickly, easily and comfortably. This is
very agreeable ; but I doubt whether it is, mor-
ally speaking, very healthy. It is not even very
healthy for the body. It is in the civilized
countries, where human beings eat most and take
least exercise, that cancer is most prevalent. The
disease spreads with every fresh expansion of
Henry Ford's factories.

None the less I prefer to follow in the car.
To the wander-birds whom we pass on our way,
I take off my hat. It is a mark of my sincere
esteem. But inwardly I repeat to myself the
words of the Abbot in the Canterbury Tales :
6 Let Austin have his swink to him reserved.'
THE TRAVELLER'S-EYE VIEW

I

COULD give many excellent reasons for my
dislike of large dinner-parties, soirees^ crushes.,
routs, conversazioni and balls. Life is not long
enough and they waste precious time 5 the game
is not worth the candle. Casual social inter-
course is like dram-drinking, a mere stimulant
that whips the nerves but does not nourish. And
so on. These are respectable contentions and
all quite true. And they have certainly had
weight with me. But the final argument against
large assemblages and in favour of solitude and the
small intimate gathering has been, in my case, of
a more personal character. It has appealed5 not
to my reason, but my vanity. The fact is that
I do not shine in large assemblies; indeed, I
scarcely glimmer. And to be dim and conscious
of one's dimness is humiliating.

This incapacity to be bright in company is due
entirely to my excessive curiosity. I cannot
listen to what my interlocutor is saying or think
of anything to say in answer to him, because I
cannot help listening to the conversations being
carried on by everybody else within earshot. My
interlocutor, for example, is saying something
very intelligent about Henry James and is ob-
ALONG   THE   ROAD

viously expecting me, when he has done, to make
some smart or subtle comment. But the two
women on my left are telling scandalous stones
about a person I know. The man with the loud
voice at the other side of the room is discussing
the merits of different motor cars. The science
student by the fireplace is talking about the
quantum theory, The distinguished Irish lawyer
is telling anecdotes in his inimitable professional
manner. Behind me a youth and maiden are ex-
changing views on love, while from the group in
the far aorner I hear an occasional phrase which
tells me that they are talking politics. An in-
vincible curiosity possesses me, I long to hear
exactly what each is saying. Scandal, motors,
quanta, Irish bulls, love and politics seem to me in-
comparably more interesting than Henry James |
and each of these is at the same time more in-
teresting than all the others. Inquisitiveness
flutters hopelessly this way and that, like a bird
in a glass house. And the net result is that, not
hearing what he says and being too much dis-
tracted to answer coherently, I make myself
appear an idiot to my interlocutor, while the very
number of my illicit curiosities renders it impos-
sible for me to satisfy any single one of them.
But this excessive and promiscuous inquisitive-

26
THE   TRAVELLER'S-EYE   VIEW
ness5 so fatal to a man who desires to mix in
society, is a valuable asset to the one who merely
looks on5 without participating in the actions of
his fellows.

For the traveller, who is compelled, whether
he likes to or not, to pose as the detached on-
looker., inquisitiveness is nothing less than a ne-
cessity. Ennui, says Baudelaire^ & is fruit de
la morne incuriosite.* The tourist who has no
curiosity is doomed to boredom.

There are few pleasanter diversions "than to sit
in cafes or restaurants or the third-class carriages
of railway trains, looking at one's neighbours and
listening (without attempting to enter into con-
versation) to such scraps of their talk as are wafted
across the intervening space. From their ap-
pearance, from what they say, one reconstructs in
the imagination the whole character, the complete
life history. Given the single fossil.bone, one
fancifully builds up the whole diplodocus. It is
an excellent game. But it must be played dis-
creetly. Too open a curiosity is apt to be
resented. One must look and listen without
appearing to be aware of anything. If the game
is played by two people, comments should always
be made in some language other than that of the
country in which the game is played. But per-

27
ALONG  THE   ROAD

haps the most important rule of the game is that
which forbids one, except in the most extra-
ordinary cases, to make any effort to get to know
the objects of one's curiosity.

For, alas, the objects of one's curiosity prove^
once one has .made their acquaintance, to be5
almost invariably, quite unworthy of any further
interest. It is possible at a distance to feel the
roost lively curiosity about a season-ticket holder
from Surbiton. His bald head is so shiny $ he
has such a funny waxed moustache 5 he gets so
red in the face when he talks to his friends about
the socialists ; he laughs with such loud unplea-
sant gusto when one of them tells a dirty story ;
he sweats so profusely when it is hot; he holds
forth so knowledgeabiy about roses; and his sister
lives at Birmingham 5 his son has just won a
prize for mathematics at school. At long range
all this is fascinating ; it stimulates the imagina-
tion. One loves the little man; he is wonder-
ful, charming, a real slice of life. But make
his acquaintance. . � . From that day forth you
take pains to travel in another compartment.

How delightful, how queer and fantastic people

are, at a distance !    When I think of the number

of fascinating men and women I have never

known (only seen and momentarily listened to) I

28
THE TRAVELLER'S-EYE VIEW
am astonished. I can remember hundreds of
them. My favourites, I arn inclined to think,
were those male and female post-office clerks who
lived en pension at the little hotel at Amberieu
where once I stayed for a week or so, finishing a
book. They were fascinating. There was the
oldish man, who always came' in late for dinner,
wearing a cap�a grim, taciturn fellow he was ;
there was the very young boy, not at all grim5 but
silent out of pure shyness ; there was the very
bright,lively, meridional fellow5 who made jokes
all the time and flirtatiously teased the young
ladies ; and the three young ladies, one ugly but
tolerably lively, one rather pretty but lirnp and
chlorotic, and the third so full of attractive vitality
that she compelled one to think her pretty�such
rolling black eyes, such a smile, such a voice, so
witty ! The shy young man gazed like a calf,
blushed when she looked at him, smiled oxishly
when she talked, and forgot to eat his dinner.
Her presence thawed the grim and grizzled man
and roused the meridional, to yet higher flights.
And her superiority was so enormous that the
ugly girl and the chlorotic girl were not in the
least jealous, but worshipped her. It is absurd
to be jealous of the gods.

How I adored that party I"   With what pas-

29
ALONG  THE   ROAD

sionate interest I overlooked them from my table
in the little dining-room ! How attentively I
eavesdropped ! I learned where they had spent
their holidays, which of them had been to Paris,
where their relations lived, what they thought of
the postmaster of Amb6rieu5 and a host of other
thingSj all wonderfully interesting and exciting.
But not for the world would I have made their
acquaintance. The landlady offered to introduce
me ; but I declined the honour. I am afraid
she thought me a snob ; she was proud of her
pensionnaires. It was impossible for me to ex-
plain that my reluctance to know them was due
to the fact that I loved them even more than she
did. To know them would have spoilt every-
thing. From wonderful and mysterious beings,
they would have degenerated into six rather dull
and pathetic little employes, condemned to pass
their lives drearily in a small provincial town.

And then there were the millionaires at Padua,
How much we enjoyed those ! It was the
waiter who told us they were plutocrats. In the
restaurant of the Hotel Storione at Padua there
is one special table, it appears, reserved for million-
aires. Four or five of them lunched there regu-
larly every day while we were in the hotel.
Superb figures they were, and wonderfully in

character like millionaires in an Italian film.
In an American film, of course> the type is very
different. A Hollywood millionaire is a strong,
silent man, clean-shaven, with a face either like
a hatchet or an uncooked muffin. These, on
the contrary, had tremendous beards, talked a
great deal, were over-dressed and wore white
gloves. They looked like a little party of Blue-
beards.

Another of my- remembered favourites is the
siren we saw at the Ristorante Gentrale at Genoa.
She sat at a neighbouring table with four men, all
desperately in love with her, talking, one could
see by the way they listened and laughed, like all
the heroines of Congreve rolled into one. One
of the men was a Turk and had to have recourse
periodically to the interpreter, without whose aid
the majority of diners in that polyglot restaurant
would be unable to order their macaroni. One
�he was old and paid for the dinner�must have
been her husband or her lover. Poor fellow, he
looked rather glum sometimes, when she ad-
dressed herself too fascinatingly to the Turk, who
was her principal victim, or one of the other men.
But then she gave him a smile, she lifted her pale
blue-grey eyes at him and he: was happy again.
No, not happy exactly 5 happy is the wrong word.
ALONG THE ROAD
Drunk�that would be more like it, I imagine.
Deliriously joyful on the surface ; and within
bottomlessly miserable. So we speculated, ro-
mantically, at long range. What we should have
discovered on a nearer acquaintance I do not
know�I do not want to know.

The most uninteresting human being seen at
a little distance by a spectator with a lively fancy
and a determination to make the most of life takes
on a mysterious charing becomes odd and exciting.
One can work up a thrilling emotion about dis-
tant and unknown people�an emotion which it
is impossible to recapture after personal acquaint-
ance, but which yields place to understanding and
consequent affection or antipathy.

Certain authors have exploited, either deliber-
ately or because they could not do otherwise, their
spectator's emotion in the presence of unknown
actors. There is Joseph Conrad, for example.
The mysterious thrilling charm of his characters^
particularly his female characters, is due to the
fact that he knows -nothing at all about them.
He sits at a distance, he watches them acting and
then wonders ^nd wonders, through pages of
Marlow*s windirk narratives, why on earth they
acted as they did, What were their motives, what
they felt and .thought. The God's-eye view of
THE   TRAVELLER'S-EYE   VIEW

those novelists who really know, or pretend they
know, exactly what is going on in the minds of
their characters, is exchanged for the traveller's-
eye view, the view of the stranger who starts with
no knowledge whatever of the actors' personalities
and can only infer from their gestures what is
happening in their minds. Conrad, it must be
admitted, manages to infer very little 5 he lacks
the palaeontologist's imagination, has little power
of reconstructing thought from seen behaviour
At the end of a nove!5 his heroines are as shadowy
as they were at the beginning. They have acted3
and Conrad has lengthily wondered�without
discovering�why they have acted in this par-
ticular way. His bewilderment is infectious $
the reader is just as hopelessly puzzled as the
author and, incidentally, finds the characters j ust
as wonderfully mysterious. Mystery is delightful
and exciting; but it is foolish to admire it too
highly. A thing is mysterious merely because it
Is unknown. There will always be mysteries
because there will always be unknown and un-
knowable things. But it is best to know what
is knowable. There Is no credit about not know-
ing what can be known. Some literary men, for
example, positively pride themselves on their
ignorance of science j they are fools and arrogant

c                        33
ALONG  THE   ROAD

at that. If Conrad's characters are mysterious^
it is not because they are complicated, difficult or
subtle characters, but simply because he does not
understand them 5 not knowing what they are
like, he speculates, unsuccessfully, and finally
admits that he finds them inscrutable. The
honesty with which he confesses his ignorance is
meritorious, not the ignorance. The characters
of the great novelists, like Dostoievsky and Tol-
stoy, are not mysterious; they are perfectly well
understood and clearly displayed. Such writers
live with their creations. Conrad only looks on
from a distance, without understanding them,.
without even making up plausible hypotheses
about thepi out of his imagination.

He differs in this respect from Miss Katherine
Mansfield, another writer who takes the travel-
ler's-eye view of human beings. *For Miss
Mansfield has a lively fancy. Like Conrad^
she sees her characters from a distance, as though
at another table in a cafe : she overhears snatches
of their conversations�about their aunts in Bat-
tersea, their stamp collections, their souls�and
she finds them extraordinary, charming beyond
all real and knowable people, odd, immensely
exciting. She finds that they are Life itself�
lovely, fantastic Life. Very rarely does she go

34
THE TRAVELLER'S-EYE VIEW
beyond this long-range cafe acquaintanceship with
her personages, rarely makes herself at home in
their flat everyday lives. But where Conrad
bewilderedly speculates. Miss Mansfield uses her
imagination. She invents suitable lives for the
fabulous creatures glimpsed at the cafe. And
how thrilling those fancied lives always are !
Thrilling, but just for that reason not very con-
vincing. Miss Mansfield's studies of interiors
are like those brilliant palaeontological recon-
structions one sees in books of popular science�
the ichthyosaurus in its native waters, pterodactyls
fluttering and swooping in the tepid tertiary sky
�too excitingly romantic, in spite of their air of
realism, to be quite genuine. Her characters are
seen with an extraordinary brilliance and pre-
cision, as one sees a party of people in a lighted
drawing-room, at night, through an uncurtained
window�one of those mysteriously significant
Parties in Parlours of which we read in Peter
Belli

Some sipping punch, some sipping tea,
And all as silent as could be,
All silent, and all damned.

cance. They seem fabulous (though of course> in
point of actual fact and to those sitting ;n the room

ALONG  THE  ROAD

with thenij they are nothing of the kind). Then
one passes, they disappear. Each of Miss Mans-
field's stones is a window into a lighted room.
The glimpse of the inhabitants sipping their tea
and punch is enormously exciting. But one
knows nothing, when one has passed3 of what
they are really like. That is why3 however thril-
ling at a first reading, her stories do not wear.
Tchekov's do ; but then he had lived with his
people as well as looked at them through the
window. The travel!er's-eye view of men and
women is not satisfying. A man might spend
his life in trains and restaurants and know nothing
of humanity at the end. To know5 one must be
an actor as well as a spectator* One must dine
at home as well as in restaurants5 must give up the
amusing game of peeping in at unknown windows
to live quietly^ flatly5 unexcitingly indoors. Still,
the game, if it is kept as an occasional diversion
and not treated as the serious business of life, is a
very good one. And on a journey it is your only

GUIDE-BOOKS

OR every traveller who has any taste of his
own5 the only useful guide-book will be the one
which he himself has written. All others are an
exasperation. They mark with asterisks the
works of art which he finds dull, and they pass
over in silence those which he admires. They
make him travel long miles to see a mound of
rubbish ; they go into ecstasies over mere an-
tiquity. Their practical information is invari-
ably out of date. They recommend bad hotels
and qualify good ones as ' modest' In a word,
they are intolerable.

How often I have cursed Baron Baedeker for
sending me through the dust to see some nauseat-
ing Sodoma or drearily respectable Andrea del
Sarto ! How angry I have been with him for
starring what is old merely because it is old !
And how I have hated him for his lack of dis-
crimination ! He has a way of lumping all old
things of one class together and treating them as
if, being made at the same period, their merit
were exactly equal. For example, the stained
glass windows at Sens are treated by the guide-
books as though they were just like all other
stained glass of the fourteenth century, when in

37
ALONG   THE  ROAD

fact they are unique in boldness and beauty of
design. Some very great artist made the series
of Bible illustrations at Sens* The Baron speaks
as highly of the competent craftsman's work at
Chartres and Canterbury.

Similarly the monuments in the church of
Brou and the choir screen at Chartres get as many
stars as the tomb of Ilaria del Carretto at Lucca3
or Delia Robbia's bas-relief in the Opera del
Duomo at Florence. They are all of them
specimens of Renaissance sculpture. There is
only this slight difference between them ; that
the Italian works happen to be consummate
masterpieces,, while the French are mere barbar-
isms�that at Brou positively and piercingly
vulgar, that at Chartres well-meaning, laborious^
and sincerely dull. And so totally does the Baron
lack a sense of proportion that he gives as many
stars to the church of Brou as to Bourges cath-
edra^ recommending with equal enthusiasm a
horrible little architectural nightmare and the
grandest^ the most strangely and fabulously
beautiful building in Europe.

Imbecile ! But a learned, andj alas, indis-
pensable imbecile. There is no escape; one
must travel in his company�at any rate on a first
journey. It is only after having scrupulously

38
GUIDE-BOOKS

done what Baedeker commands5 after having
discovered the Baron's lapses in taste5 his artistic
prejudices and antiquarian snobberies^ that the
tourist can compile that personal guide which is
the only guide for him. If he had but possessed
it on, his first tour ! But alas, though it is
easy to take other people in by your pictu-
resque accounts of places you have never seen5
it is hard to take in yourself. The personal
guide-book must'be the fruit of bitter personal
experience.

The only satisfactory substitute for a guide
written by oneself is a guide which is copiously
illustrated. To know the images of things is the
next best to knowing the things themselves.
Illustrations allow one to see what precisely it is
that the Baron is recommending. A reproduc-
tion of those luscious Sodomas would enable one
to discount the asterisks in the text. A few
photographs of the tombs at Tarquinia would
convince one that they were incomparably better
worth looking at than the Forum. A picture of
the church of Brou would excuse one from ever
going near it. The best illustrated guide I know
is Pampaloni's Road Book of Tuscany, in which
the usual information is briefly summarized^ the
main routes from place to place described and

39
ALONG  THE   ROAD

nothing starred  that  is  not  reproduced  in  a
photograph.

For some tastes^ I know, Pampaloni seems a
little too dry. All the cackle�even as much of
it as gets into Baedeker�is cut, and one Is left
only with a telegraphic statement of facts and the
photographs. Personally I have no great weak-
ness for cackle (unless it be the cackle of genius)
and so find Pampaloni perfectly satisfying. Many
tourists, however, prefer a more literary guide.
They like sentiment, and purple passages and
states of soul in front of the Colosseum by moon-
light, and all the rest. So do I�but not from
the pens of the sort of people who write chatty
guides. To me, even Baedeker seems at times
rather too lyrical I like my guides to be informa-
tive, unenthusiastic and, where practical matters
are concerned, up-to-date�which Baedeker, by
the way (reluctant, I suppose, for patriotic reasons
to acknowledge the fact of the late War) is not.
If I want cackle I take with me au better stylist
than the Baron or his gushing substitutes.

The only literary guides I enjoy are the really
bad ones�so bad that their badness makes, so to
speak, a full circle and becomes something sub-
lime. Your ordinary literary guides are never
bad in this superlative way. Theirs is that well-

40
GUIDE-BOOKS

bred5 efficient mediocrity for which there is
nothing whatever to be said. It is only in obscure
local guides that one finds the sublimely ludicrous.
In any town it is always worth taking a look at the
local guide. If you are lucky you will find one
In which a train is called 6 Stephenson's magic
babe.' Not often, I admit (for it is not every day
that a genius is born who can hit on such felici-
ties) ; but often enough to make the search worth
while. I myself have found some notable pas-
sages in local Italian guides. This description
of a sixth-rate ' Venus rising from the Sea * is
juicy : * Fenere^ abllgllata di una calda nudita5
sorge dalle onde. . . . E una seducente figura dl
donna, palpitante, voluttuosa. Sembra che sotto

have done better. But the finest specimen of
the guide-book style I have ever met with was in
France. It is a description of Dijon. * Comme*

occasion, that I accede to Lord Rothermere's
request.

Old guide-books, so out of date as to be histo-
rical documents, make excellent travelling-com-
panions. An early Murray is a treasure. Indeed,
any volume of European travels, however dull, is
interesting, provided that it be written before the
age of railways and Ruskin. It is delightful to
read on the spot the impressions and opinions of
tourists who visited a hundred years ago3 in the
vehicles and with the aesthetic prejudices of the
period., the places which you are visiting now.
The voyage ceases to be a mere tour through
space 5 you travel through time and thought as
well. They are morally wholesome reading too,
these old books of travel 5 for they make one
. realize the entirely accidental character of all our
tastes and our fundamental intellectual beliefs.
It seems to us axiomatic, for example, that Giotto
was a great artist; and yet Goethe, when he
went to Assisi, did not even take the trouble to
look at the frescoes in the church. For him, the
only thing worth seeing at Assisi was the portico .

of the Roman temple. We for our part cannot
get much pleasure out of Guercino ; and yet
Stendhal was ravished by him. We find Canova
& amusing' and sometimes, as in the statue of
Pauline Borghese, really charming in a soft, vol-
uptuous way (the very cushion on which she
reclines bulges out voluptuously 5 one is reminded
of those positively indecent clouds over which
Correggio's angels look down at one from the
dome at Parma). But we cannot quite agree
with Byron when he says & Such as the Great of
yore, Canova is to-day.' And yet after all,
Goethe, Stendhal, and Byron were no fools.
Given their upbringing, they could not have
thought differently. We would have thought
just as they did, if we had lived a hundred years
ago. Our altered standards of appreciatipn and
generally greater tolerance are chiefly the result
of increased acquaintance with the art of every
nation and period�an acquaintance due in its
turn chiefly to photography. The vastly greater
part of the world's art has been non-realistic \ we
know the world's art as our ancestors never did 5
it is therefore only to be expected that we should
be much more favourably disposed to non-realistic
art, much less impressed by realism as such than
men who were brought up almost exclusively in

43
ALONG  THE   ROAD
the knowledge of Greek, Roman and modern
realism.    These old books teach us not to be too
arrogant and cocksure in our judgments.    We
too shall look foolish in our turn.

There are so many of these old books and they
are all so characteristic of their epoch? that one
can select them almost at random from the shelves
of a well-stocked library, certain that whatever
one lights on will be entertaining and instructive
reading. Speaking from my own personal ex-
perience? I have always found Stendhal particu-
larly agreeable as an Italian companion. The
Promenades dans Rome have accompanied me on
many of my walks in that city and never failed to
please. Very enjoyable too, when one is in
Rome., is the too much neglected Veuillot. I
will not pretend that Veuillot is a great writer,
Indeed, much of his charm and apparent origin*
ality consists in the merely accidental fact that his
prejudices were unlike those which most travellers
bring with them to Italy. We are so much
accustomed to hearing that the temporal power
was an unmixed evil and that the priests were the
cause of Italy's degradation, that a man who tells
us the contrary seems startlingly original After
the denunciations of so many Protestants and free-
thinkers we read his book, if it be tolerably well

44
GUIDE-BOOKS

written (and Veuillot was a first-rate journalist^
with a special pleasure. (It is5 in the same way5
the unusualness of the point of view from which
it is written that makes Les Paysans of Balzac
seem an even more remarkable book than it really
is. We are used to reading novels in which the
humble virtues of the peasant are exaltedj his hard
lot deplored and the tyranny of the landlord de-
nounced. Balzac starts with the assumption that
the peasant is an unmitigated ruffian and demands
our sympathy for the unhappy landlord^ who is
represented as suffering incessant and unmerited
persecution at the hands of the peasants. Balzac's
reading of social history may not be correct 5 but
it is at least refreshingly unlike that of most
novelists who deal with similar themes.) Les
Parfums de Rome shares with Les Paysans the
merit of being written from an unexpected point
of view. Veuillot tours the papal states deter-
mined to see in them the earthly paradise. And
he succeeds. His Holiness has only happy sub-
jects. Outside this blessed fold prowl the wild
beasts, Cavour, Mazzini, Garibaldi and the rest 5
it is the duty of every right-thinking man to see
that they do not break in. This is his theme
and he finds in everything he sees excuses for
recurring to it. Les Parfums de Rome is written.

45
ALONG  THE  ROAD
with  a  refreshing  intemperance  of language,
Veuillot, like Zimrni, was

So over violent or over civil.

That every man with Mm was God or Devil,

Moreover he was logical and had the courage of
his convictions. How admirable, for'example,
is his denunciation of all pagan art on the ground
that it is not Christian ! While all the rest of
the world grovel before the Greeks and Romans.,
Veuillot, the logical ultramontanist, condemns
them and all their works, on principle, con-
temptuously. It is delightful.

Of the other old travelling-companions who
have given me pleasure by the way I can only
mention a few. There is that mine of informa-
tion, the President des Brosses. No one is a
better companion on the Italian^tour. Our own
Young is nearly as good in France. Miss
Berry's journals of travel are full of interest.
There are good things to be got from Lady Mary
Montagu. Beckford is the perfect dilettante.
But plain Bible-selling Borrow has the credit of
being the first man to appreciate El Greco.

If pictures are not your chief interest, there is

' the admirable Dr. Burney, whose Musical Tours

are as instructive as they are delightful.    His

46
GUIDE-BOOKS

Italian volumes are valuable, among many other
reasons, because they make one realize what had
happened, during the eighteenth century, to all
the prodigious talent which had gone, in the past,,
to painting pictures, carving statues and building
churches. It had all gone into music. The
very street players were accomplished contra-
puntists , the peasants sang divinely (you should
hear the way they sing now !), every church had
a good choir which was perpetually producing
new masses, motets and oratorios; there was
hardly a lady or gentleman who was not a first-
rate amateur performer 5 there were innumer-
able concerts. Dr. Burney found it a musician's,
paradise. And what has happened to Italian
genius nowadays ? Does it still exist ? or is it
dead ?

It still exists, I think 5 but it has been deflected
out of music, as it was deflected out of the visual
arts, into politics and, later, into business and
engineering. The first two-thirds of the nine-
teenth century were sufficiently occupied in the
achievement of freedom and unity. The sixty
years since then have been devoted to the ex-
ploitation of the country's resources ; and such
energy as has been left over from that task has
gone into politics. One day, when they have.*

and their talent to flow back into the old channels.
Let us hope they will.
SPECTACLES

i

NEVER move without a plentiful supply of
optical glass. A pair of spectacles for reading, a
pair for long range, with a couple of monocles in
reserve�these go with me everywhere. To
break all these, it would need an earthquake or a
railway accident. And absence of mind would
have to be carried to idiocy before they could all
be lost. Moreover,, there is a further safety in a
numerous supply : for matter, who can doubt it ?
is not neutral, as the men of science falsely teach,
but slightly malignant, on the side of the devils
against us. This being so, one pair of spectacles
must inevitably break or lose itself, just when you
can least afford to do without and are least able to
replace it. But inanimate matter, so called, is no
fool; and when a pair of spectacles realizes that
you carry two or three other pairs in your pockets
and suit-cases, it will understand ^that the game
is hopeless and, so far from deliberately smashing
or losing itself, will take pains to remain intact.

But when, in any month after the vernal
equinox and before the autumn, my wanderings
take me southwards, towards the sun, my armoury
of spectacles is enlarged by the addition of three
pairs of coloured glasses�two of lighter "and

D                       49
ALONG   THE   ROAD

darker shades of green3 and one black. The
glare from dusty roads^ from white walls and the
metallic, blue-hot sky is painful and even danger-
ous. As the summer advances or retreats3 as the
light of each day waxes or declines^ I adjust to
my nose the pale green? the dark green or the
black spectacles. In this way I am able to
temper the illumination of the world to my exact
requirements.

But even if I suffered not at all from excess of
light and could perform without winking the
feats of the eagle and the oxy-acetylene welder, I
should still take coloured glasses with rne on my
southward travels. For they have an aesthetic
as well as a merely practical use. They improve
the landscape as well as soothe the eyes.

As one approaches the great desert belt which
bands the earth with some thousand miles of
aridity to this side of the tropic of Cancer^ the
landscape suffers a change which to us northern-
ers at least seems a change for the worse. It
loses its luxuriant greenness. South of Lyons
(except among the mountains and in the marshes)
there is no grass worthy of the name. The
deciduous trees grow with reluctance, yielding
place to the black cypress and pine, the dark green
laurel and juniper, the" pale grey olive. The

.    SO
SPECTACLES

greens in an Italian landscape are either pale and
dusty or glossily dark. Only when you climb to
two thousand feet�and by no means Invariably
then�does anything like the brilliant, the seem-
ingly self-luminous verdure of the English scene
appear. The typical north Italian landscape is
one of hills, the lower slopes grey with olives, the
summits, when they are above the level of culti-
vation, bare and brown. It is a landscape that
makes a not entirely satisfactory compromise be-
tween the northern type and the fully southern.
The English scene is made rich and comfortable
by the bosomy forms and the damply glowing
colours of its luxuriant foliage. And its rather
rotund earthiness is tempered and made romantic
by the bloom of mist that half veils it from sight.
The southern, Mediterranean landscape, which
makes^its first Italian appearance at Terracina, is
bare, sharp-outlined and austerely brilliant. The
air is clear, and the far-seen earth seems itself to
be made of coloured air. The landscape of
Northern Italy is neither northern nor southern
�neither aerially bright and light nor, on the
other hand, rounded, or softly, luxuriously green.
It is here, in this half-parched landscape that is
not yet refined to a bright asceticism, that the
judicious traveller will don his green spectacles.
ALONG   THE   ROAD

The effect Is magical. Every blade of dusty
grass becomes on the instant rich with juicy life.
Whatever greenness lurks in the grey of the olive
trees shines out5 intensified. The dried-up woods
reburgeon. The vines and the growing corn
seem to have drunk of a refreshing rain. All
that the scene lacked to make it perfectly beautiful
is instantaneously added. Through green spec-
tacles5 it becomes the northern landscape, but
transformed and glorified�brighter, more nobly
dramatic and romantic.

Green spectacles make excellent wearing, too,
on the shores of the northern Mediterranean.
In the south the blue of the sea is beautifully dark,
like lapis-lazuli. It is the wine-dark sea of an-
tiquity in contrast with which the sunlit land seems
more than ever light, clear-coloured and aerial.
But north of Rome the blue is insufficiently in-
tense ; it is a china not a lazuline blue. The sea
at Monaco and Genoa5 at Spezia and Civitavecchia
has the blue, glassy stare of a doll's eye�a stare
that becomes very soon enraging in its enormous
blankness and brightness. Put on green spec-
tacles and this blank stare becomes at once the
darkly glaucous, enigmatic 'gaze that shines up,
between the cypresses, from the pools in the Villa
d'Este gardens at Tivoli. From imbecile, the

sea turns siren, and the arid hills that overhang
it break into verdure as though beneath the feet
of the spring.

Or if you like, you may put on black spectacles
and so deepen the colour till it approaches that of
the wine-dark Mediterranean of Greece and
Magna Graecia and the isles. Black spectacles
do nothing, however, to make the land more
southern in aspect. By the side of their dark sea,,
the southern coasts seem built of bright air.
Blade spectacles may darken the northern sea 5
but they also give weight and an added solidity to
the land. The glass which shall make the world
Seera brighter, clearer and lighter, put sunlight
into the grey landscape and turn north into south
still, alas, remains to be invented.

S3
THE COUNTRY

I

,T is a curious fact, of which I can think of
no satisfactory explanation that enthusiasm for
country life and love of natural scenery are strong-
est and most widely diffused precisely in those
European countries which have the worst climate
and where the search for the picturesque involves
the greatest discomfort. Nature worship in-
creases in an exact ratio with distance from the
Mediterranean. The Italians and the Spanish
have next to no interest in nature for its own sake.
The French feel a certain affection for the
country, but not enough to make them desire to
live in it if they can possibly inhabit the town.
The south Germans and Swiss form an apparent
exception to the rule. They live nearer to the
Mediterranean than the Parisians, and yet they
are fonder of the country^ But the exception, as
I have said, is only apparent 5 for owing to their
remoteness from the ocean and the mountainous
conformation of the land, these people enjoy for
a large part of each year a climate that is, to all
intents, arctic. In England, where the climate
is detestable, we love the country so much that we
are prepared, for the privilege of living in it, to
get up at seven, summer and winter, bicycle, wet

54
THE   COUNTRY

or fine, to a distant station and make an hour's
journey to our place of labour. In our spare
moments we go for walking tours, and we regard
caravanning as a pleasure. In Holland the
climate is far more unpleasant than In England
and we should consequently expect the Dutch to
be even keener country-fanciers than ourselves.
The ubiquitous water makes it difficult, however,
for season-ticket holders to settle down casually
in the Dutch countryside. But if unsuitable as
building land, the soggy meadows of the Low
Countries are firm enough to carry tents. Un-
able to live permanently in the country, the Dutch
are the greatest campers in the world. Poor
Uncle Toby, when he was campaigning in those
parts, found the damp so penetrating, that he was
forced to burn good brandy in his tent to dry the
.air. But then my Uncle Toby was a mere
Englishman, brought up in a climate which,
compared with that of Holland, is balmy. The
hardier Dutch camp out for pleasure. Of North-
ern Germany it is enough to say that it is the
home of the wander-birds. And as for Scandi-
navia�it is well known that there is no part of the
world, excluding the tropics, where people so
freely divest themselves of their clothing. The
Swedish passion for nature is so strong that it can

55
ALONG  THE   ROAD

only be adequately expressed when in a state of
nature. 6 As souls unbodied/ says Donne,
4 bodies unclothed must be to taste whole joys.9
Noble, nude and far more modern than any other
people in Europe, they sport in the icy waters of
the Baltic, they roam naked in the primeval
forest. The cautious Italian, meanwhile, bathes
in his tepid sea during only two months out of the
twelve ; always wears a vest under his shirt and
never leaves the town, if he can possibly help it,
except when the summer is at its most hellish, and
again, for a little while. In the autumn, to super-
intend the making of his wine.

Strange and Inexplicable state of affairs ! Is
it that the dwellers under Inclement skies are
trying to bluff themselves into a belief that they
inhabit Eden ? Do they deliberately love nature
in the hope of persuading themselves that she is
as beautiful in the damp and darkness as in the
sunlight ? Do they brave the discomforts of
northern country life in order to be able to say to
those who live in more favoured lands : You see,
our countryside is just as delightful as yours ;
and the proof is that we live in it !

But whatever the reason, the fact remains that
nature worship does Increase with distance from
the sun. To search for causes is hopeless ; but

56
THE   COUNTRY

it is easy and at the same time not uninteresting
to catalogue effects. Thus, our Anglo-Saxon
passion for the country has had the result of turn-
ing the country into one vast town 5 but a town
without the urban conveniences which makes
tolerable life in a city. For we all love the
country so much, that we desire to live in it, if
only during the night, when we are not at work.
We build cottages, buy season tickets and bicycles
to take us to the station. And meanwhile the
country perishes. The Surrey 1 knew as a boy
was full of wildernesses. To-day Hindhead is
hardly distinguishable from the Elephant and
Castle. Mr. Lloyd George has built a week-end
cottage (not, one feels, without a certain apposite-
ness) at the foot of the Devil's Jumps 5 and
several thousand people are busily following his
example. Every lane is now a street. Harrod's
and Selfridge's call daily. There is no more
country, at any rate within fifty miles of London,
Our love has killed it.

Except in summer, when it is too hot to stay
in town, the French, and still more, the Italians,
do not like the country. The result is that they
still have country not to like. Solitude stretches
almost to the gates of Paris. (And Paris, re-
member, still has gates j you drive up to them

57
ALONG  THE   ROAD

along country roads, enter and find yourself
within a few minutes of the centre of the city).
The silence sleeps unbroken, except by the faint
music of ghosts, within a mile of the Victor
Emanuel monument at Rome.

In France, in Italy none but countrymen live
in the country. Agriculture there is taken seri-
ously ; farms are still farms and not week-end
cottages; and the corn is still permitted to grow
on what, in England, would be desirable building
land.

In Italy, despite the fact that the educated
Italians like the country still less than the French,
there are fewer complete solitudes than in France,
because there are more countrymen. And how
few there are In France ! A drive from the
Belgian frontier to the Mediterranean puts life
and meaning into those statistics from which we
learn, academically and in theory, that France is
under-populated. Long stretches of open road
extend between town and town.

Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,

Or captain jewels in the carcanct.

Even the villages are few and far between, And
those innumerable farms which shine out from
among the olive trees on Italian hill-sides�one

58
THE   COUNTRY

looks in vain for their French counterpart
Driving through the fertile plains of Central
France5 one can turn one's eyes over the fields
and scarcely see a house. And then, what
forests still grown on French soil ! Huge tracts
of uninhabited woodland, with not a week-ender
or a walking-tourist to be seen within their
shades.

This state ofkhings is delightful to me person-
ally ) for I like the country, enjoy solitude, and
take no interest in the political future of France.
But to a French patriot I can imagine that a drive
across his native land must seem depressing.
Huge populations, upon whose skulls the bump
of philoprogenitiveness can be seen at a quarter
of a mile, pullulate on the further side of almost
every frontier. Without haste, without rest, as
though by a steadily continued miracle, the
Germans and the Italians multiply themselves,
like loaves and fishes. -Every three years a
million brand new Teutons peer across the Rhine,
a million Italians are wondering where they are
going to find room, in their narrow country, to
live. And there are no more Frenchmen.
Twenty years hence, what will happen ? The
French Government offers prizes to those who
produce large families. In vain; everybody

59
ALONG   THE   ROAD

knows all about birth control and even in the
least educated classes there are no prejudices and
a great deal of thrift. Hordes of blackamoors are
drilled and armed 5 but blackamoors can be but
a poor defence. In the long run, against European
philoprogenitiveness. Sooner or later, this half-
empty land will be colonized. It may be done
peacefully, It may be done with violence 5 let us
hope peacefully, with the consent and at the in-
vitation of the French themselves. Already the
French import, temporarily, I forget how many
foreign labourers every year. -In time, no doubt,
the foreigners will begin to settle : the Italians in
the south, the Germans in the east, the Belgians in
the north, perhaps even a few English In the west.

Frenchmen may not like the plan ; but until
all nations agree to practise birth control to
exactly the same extent, it is the best that can
be devised.

The Portuguese who, In the later sixteenth and
the seventeenth century, suffered acutely from
under-population (half the able-bodied men had
emigrated to the colonies, where they died in war
� or of tropical diseases, while those who stayed at
home were periodically decimated by famine�
for the colonies produced only gold, not bread)
solved their problem by importing negro slaves to

60
THE  COUNTRY

work the deserted fields. The negroes settled.
They intermarried with the inhabitants. In two
or three generations the race which had conquered
half the world was extinct, and Portugal, with the
exception of a small area in the north, was in-
habited by a hybrid race of Ear-Africans. The
French may think themselves lucky if, avoiding
war, they can fill their depleted country with
civilized white men.

Meanwhile, the emptiness of France Is a de-
light to every lover of nature and solitude. But
even in Italy, where farms and peasants and
peasants* children are thick on the land, the lover
of the country feels much happier than he does in
what may actually be more sparsely inhabited
districts of the home counties. For farms and
peasants are country products, as truly native to
the land as trees or growing corn, and as in-
offensive. It is the urban interloper who ruins
the English country. Neither he nor his house
belong to it. In Italy, on the other hand, when
the rare trespasser from the town does venture
into the country, he finds it genuinely rustic.
The country is densely populated, but it is still
the country. It has not been killed by the deadly
kindness of those who3 like myself, are nature's
townsmen.

61
ALONG THE ROAD
The time is not far distant, I am afraid, when
every countryside in Europe, even the Spanish,
will be invaded by nature lovers from the towns.
It is not so long ago5 after all, since Evelyn was
horri fied and disgusted by th e spectacle of the rocks
at Clifton. Till the end of the eighteenth cen-
tury every sensible man, even in England, even
in Sweden, feared and detested mountains. The
modern enthusiasm for wild nature is a recent
growth and began�along with kindness to
animals, industrialism and railway travelling�
among the English. (It is, perhaps, not surpris-
ing that the people which first made their cities
uninhabitable with dirt, noise and smoke should
also have been the first to love nature.) From
this island country sentiment has spread with
machinery. All the world welcomed machinery
with delight 5 but country sentiment has so far
flourished only in the north. Still, there are
evident signs that even the Latins are becoming
infected by it. In France and Italy wild nature
has become�though to a far less extent than in
England�the object of mobisme. It is rather
chic, in those countries, to be fond of nature. In
a few years, I repeat, everybody will adore it as a
matter of course. For even in the north those
who do not in the least like the country are made

62
THE   COUNTRY

to imagine that they do by the artful and never-
ceasing suggestions of the people whose interest
It is that the country should be liked. No
modern man, even if he loathed the country5
could resist the appeal of the innumerable adver-
tisements, published by railways, motor car manu-
facturers, thermos flask makers, sporting tailors,
house agents and all the rest whose livelihood
depends on his frequently visiting the country.
Now the art of advertising in the Latin countries
is still poorly developed. But it is improving
even there. The march of progress is irresistible.
Fiat and the State Railways have only to hire
American advertising managers to turn the
Italians into a race of week-enders and season-
ticket holders. Already there is a Citta Giardino
on the outskirts of Rome ; Ostia is being devel-
oped as a residential seaside suburb ; the recently
opened motor road has placed the Lakes at the
mercy of Milan. My grandchildren, I foresee,
will have to take their holidays in Central Asia.
BOOKS FOR THE  JOURNEY

A,

tourists cherish an illusion, of which no
amount of experience can ever completely cure
them ; they Imagine that they will find time, in
the course of their travels, to do a lot of reading.
They see themselves, at the end of a day's sight-
seeing or motoring, or while they are sitting in
the train, studiously turning over the pages of all
the vast and serious works which, at ordinary
seasons, they never find time to read. They
start for a fortnight's tour in France, taking with
them The Critique of Pure Reason, Appearance
and Reality^ the complete works of Dante and the
Golden Bough. They come home to make the
discovery that they have read something less than
half a chapter of the Golden Bough and the first
fifty-two lines of the Inferno. But that does not
prevent them from taking just as many books the
next time they set out on their travels.

Long experience has taught me to reduce in
some slight measure the dimensions of my travel-
ling library. But even now I arn far too opti-
mistic about my powers of reading while on a
journey. Along with the books which I know
it is possible to read, I still continue to put in a
few impossible volumes in the pious hope that

64
BOOKS FOR THE JOURNEY
some day, somehow, they will get read. Thick
tomes have travelled with me for thousands of
kilometres across the face of Europe and have
returned with their secrets unviolated. But
whereas in the past I took nothing but thick
tomes, and a great quantity of them at that, I
now take only one or two and for the rest pack
only the sort of books which I know by experience
can be read in a hotel bedroom after a day's sight-
seeing.

The qualities essential in a good travelling-
book are these. It should be a work of such a
kind that one can open it anywhere and be sure
of finding something Interesting, complete in it-
self and susceptible of being read in a short time.
A book requiring continuous attention and pro-
longed mental effort is useless on a voyage ; for
leisure, when one travels, is brief and tinged with
physical fatigue, the mind distracted and unapt
to make protracted exertions."

Few travelling-books are better than a good
anthology of poetry in which every page contains
something complete and perfect in itself. The
brief respites from labour which the self-immol-
ated tourist allows himself cannot be more
delightfully filled than with the reading of poetry,
which may even be got by heart; for the
ALONG  THE  ROAD

though reluctant to follow an argument, takes
pleasure in the slight labour of committing
melodious words to memory.

In the choice of anthologies every traveller
must please himself. My own favourite is
Edward Thomas's Pocket Book of Poems and Songs
for the Open Air. Thomas was a man of wide
reading and of exquisite taste, and peculiarly
gifted, moreover, to be an anthologist of the Open
Air. For out of the huge tribe of modern versi-
fiers who have babbled of green fields, Thomas
is almost the only one whom one feels to be a
c nature poet* (the expression is somehow rather
horrible, but there is no other) by right of birth
and the conquest of real sympathy and under-
standing* It is not every one who says Lord,
Lord, that shall enter into the kingdom of heaveni
and few, very few of those who cry Cuckoo,
Cuckoo, shall be admitted into the company of
nature poets. For proof of this I refer my
readers to the various volumes of Georgian
Poetry.

Equally well adapted, with poetry, to the
traveller's need, are collections of aphorisms or
maxims. If they are good�and they must be
very good indeed ; for there is nothing more
dismal than a * Great Thought * enunciated by an

66
BOOKS FOR THE JOURNEY
author who has not himself the elements of great-
ness�maxims make the best of all reading. They
take a minute to read and provide matter upon
which thought can ruminate for hours. None
are to be preferred to La Rochefoucauld's. My-
self, I always reserve my upper left-hand waist-
coat pocket for a small sexto-decimo reprint of
the Maximes. It is a book to which there is no
bottom or end. For with every month that one
lives, with every accession to one's knowledge,
both of oneself and of others, it means something
more. For La Rochefoucauld knew almost
everything about the human soul, so that prac-
tically every discovery one can make oneself, as
one advances through life, has been anticipated
by him and formulated in the briefest and most
elegant phrases. I say advisedly that La Roche-
foucauld knew * almost' everything about the
human soul ; for it is obvious that he did not
know all. He knew everything about the souls
of human beings in so far as they are social animals.
Of the soul of man in solitude�of man when he
is no more interested in the social pleasures and
successes which were, to La Rochefoucauld, so
all-important�he knows little or nothing. If
we desire to know something about the human
soul in solitude�in its relations, not to man, but
ALONG  THE   ROAD

to God�we must go elsewhere : to the Gospels^
to the novels of Dostoievsky, for example. But
man in his social relationships has never been more

accurately described, and his motives never more
j               *

delicately analysed than by La Rochefoucauld.
The aphorisms vary considerably in value ; but
the best of them�and their number is surprisingly
large�are astonishingly profound and pregnant
They resume a vast experience. In a sentence
La Rochefoucauld compresses as much material
as would serve a novelist for a long story, Con-
versely, it would not surprise me to learn that
many novelists turn to the Maxtmes for sugges-
tions for plots and characters It is impossible,
for example, to read Proust without being re-
minded of the Maximes, or the Maximes without
being reminded of Proust. c Le plaisir de Pamour
est d'aimer, et 1'on est plus heureux par la passion
que Ton a que par celle que Pon donne.' * II y a
des gens si rernplis d'etix-m�mes, que, lorsqu'tls
sont amoureux, ils trouvent moyen d'etre occupes
de leur passion sans Pfitre de la personne qu'ils
aiment.' What are all the love stories in A la
Recherche du Temps Perdu but enormous arflpli-
fications of these aphorisms ? Proust is La
Rochefoucauld magnified ten thousand times.
Hardly less satisfactory as travel books are the
68
BOOKS FOR THE JOURNEY
aphoristic works of Nietzsche. Nietzsche's say-
Ings have this in common with La Rochefou-
cauld's, that they are pregnant and expansive.
His best aphorisms are long trains of thought,
compressed. The mind can dwell on them at
length because so much is implicit in them. It
is in this way. that good aphorisms differ from
mere epigrams, in which the whole point consists
in the felicity of expression. An epigram pleases
by surprising 5 after the first moment the effect
wears off and we are no further interested in it.
One is not taken in twice by the same practical
joke. But an aphorism does not depend on
verbal wit. Its effect is not momentary, and the
more we think of it, the more substance we find
in it,

Another excellent book for a journey�for it
combines expansive aphorisms with anecdotes�
is Boswell's Life of Johnson^ which the Oxford
Press now issues, on India paper, in a single small
octavo volume. (All travellers, by the way, owe
much to the exertions of Henry JFrowde, of the
Oxford Press, the inventor, or at least the Europ-
ean reiriventor, of that fine rag paper, impreg-
nated with mineral matter to give it opacity,
which we call India paper.) What the aphorism
Is to the philosophical treatise, the India paper
ALONG   THE   ROAD

volume is to the ponderous editions of the past.
All Shakespeare, perfectly legible, gets into a
volume no bigger than a single novel by the late
Charles Garvice. All Pepys, or as much of him
as the British public is allowed to react, can now
be fitted into three pockets. And the Bible^
reduced to an inch in thickness, must surely be in
danger of losing those bullet-stopping qualities
which it used, at any rate in romantic novels, to
possess. Thanks to Henry Frowde one can get
a million words of reading matter into a rucksack
and hardly feel the difference in its weight.

India paper and photography have rendered
possible the inclusion in a portable library of what
in my opinion is the best traveller's book of all�
a volume (any one of the thirty-two will do) of the
twelfth, half-size edition of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica* It takes up very little room (eight
and a half inches by six and a half by one is not
excessive), it contains about a thousand pages and
an almost countless number of curious and im-
probable facts* It can be dipped into anywhere,
its component chapters are complete in them-
selves and not too long. For the traveller,
disposing as he does only of brief half-hours, it is
the perfect book, the more so, since I take it that,
being a born traveller, he is likely also to be one

70
BOOKS FOR THE JOURNEY
of those desultory and self-indulgent readers to
whom the Encyclopaedia^ when not used for some
practical purpose, must specially appeal. I never
pass a day away from home without taking a
volume with me. It is the book of books.
Turning over its pages, rummaging among the
stores of fantastically varied facts which the
hazards of alphabetical arrangement bring to-
gether, I wallow in my mental vice. A stray
volume of the Encyclopaedia is like the mind of a
learned madman�stored with correct ideas, be-
tween which, however^ there is no other connec-
tion than the fact that there is a B in both ;
from orach, or mountain spinach, one passes
directly to oracles. That one does not oneself
go mad, or become^ in the process of reading the
Encyclopaedia^ a mine of useless and unrelated
knowledge is due to the fact that one forgets.
The mind has a vast capacity for oblivion. Pro-
videntially ; otherwise, in the chaos of futile
memories, it would be impossible to remember
anything useful or coherent In practice, we
work with generalizations, abstracted out of the
turmoil of realities. �If we remembered every-
thing perfectly, we should never be able to
generalize at all 5 for there would appear before
our minds nothing but individual images, precise

71
ALONG  THE   ROAD

and different. Without ignorance we could not
generalize. Let us thank Heaven for our powers
of forgetting. With regard to the Encyclopaedia^
they are enormous. The mind only remembers
that of which it has some need. Five minutes
after reading about mountain spinach, the ordin-
ary rnan5 who is neither a botanist nor a cook,
has forgotten all about it. Read for amusementj
the Encyclopaedia serves only to distract for the
moment j it does not instruct^ it deposits nothing
on the surface of the mind that will remain. It
is a mere time-killer and momentary tickler of
the mind. 1 use it only for amusement on my
travels ; I should be ashamed to indulge so
wantonly in mere curiosity at home^ during
seasons of serious business*

MONTESENARIO

T was March and the snow was melting. Half
wintry, half vernal, the mountain looked patchy,
like a mangy dog. The southward slopes were
bare | but in every hollow, on the sunless side of
every tree, the snow still lay, white under the
blue transparent shadows.

We walked through a little pine wood 5 the
afternoon sunlight breaking through the dark
foliage lit up here a branch, there a length of
trunk, turning the ruddy bark into a kind of
golden coral Beyond the wood the hill lay bare
to the summit. On the very crest a mass of
buildings lifted their high sunlit walls against the
pale sky, a chilly little New Jerusalem. It was
the monastery of Monteseriario. We climbed
towards it, toilsomely ; for the last stage in the
pilgrim's progress from.Florence to Montesenario
is uncommonly steep and the motor must be left
behind. And suddenly, as though to welcome us,
as though to encourage our efforts, the heavenly
city disgorged a troop of angels. Turning a
corner of the track we saw them coming down to
meet us, by two and two in a long file ; angels in
black cassocks with round black hats on their
heads�a seminary taking its afternoon airing"
ALONG  THE   ROAD

They were young boys, the eldest sixteen or
seventeen, the youngest not more than ten.
Flapping along in their black skirts they walked
with an unnatural decorum. It was difficult to
believe, when one saw the little fellows at the
head of the crocodile5 with the tall Father in
charge striding along at their side, it was difficult
to believe that they were not masquerading. It
Seemed a piece of irreverent fun ; a caricature by
Goya come to life. But their faces were serious ;
chubby or adolescently thin? they wore already
an unctuously clerical expression. It was no
joke. Looking at those black-robed children,,
one wished that it had been.

We climbed on 5 the little priestlings descended
out of sight. And now at last we were at the
gates of the heavenly city. A little paved and
parapeted platform served as landing to the flight
of steps that led up into the heart of the convent
In the middle of the platform stood a more than
life-sized statue of some unheard-of saint. It
was a comically admirable piece of eighteenth-
century baroque. Carved with coarse brilliance,
the creature gesticulated ecstatically, rolling its
eyes to heaven 5 its garments flapped around it in
broad folds. It was not, somehow, the sort of
saint one expected to see standing sentinel over
MONTESENARIO

the bleakest hermitage In Tuscany. And the
convent itself�that too seemed incongruous on
the top of this icy mountain. For the heavenly
city was a handsome early baroque affair with
$ettecenfo trimmings and additions. The church
was full of twiddly gilt carvings and dreadfully
competent pictures | the remains of the seven
pious Florentines who, in the thirteenth century,
fled from the city of destruction in the plain
below, and founded this hermitage on the moun-
tain, were coffered in a large gold and crystal box,
illuminated, like a show-case in the drawing-
room of a collector of porcelain, by concealed
electric lights. No, the buildings were ludicrous.
But after all, what do buildings matter ? A man
can paint beautiful pictures in a slum, can write
poetry in Wigan 5 and conversely he can live in
an exquisite house, surrounded by masterpieces of
ancient art and yet (as one sees almost invariably
when collectors of the antique, relying for once
on their own judgment, and not on tradition, * go
in for9 modern art) be crassly insensitive and
utterly without taste. Within certain limits,
environment counts for very little. It is only
when environment is extremely unfavourable that
it can blast or distort the powers of the mind.
And however favourable, it can do nothing to

77
ALONG THE ROAD
extend the limits set by nature to a man's ability.
So here the architecture seemed Impossibly in-
congruous with the bleak place, with the very
notion of a hermitage ; but the hermits who live
In the midst of it are probably not even aware of
Its existence. In the shade of the absurd statue
of San Filippo Benizi a Buddha would be able to
think as Buddhistically as beneath the bo-tree.

In the grounds of the monastery we saw half
a dozen black-frocked Senates sawing wood�
sawing with vigour and humility, in spite of the
twiddly gilding in the church and the settecento
bell tower. They looked the genuine article.
And the view from the mountain's second peak
was In the grandest eremitic tradition. The hills
stretched away as far as the eye could reach into"
the wintry haze, like a vast heaving sea frozen
to stillness. The valleys were filled with blue
shadow, and all the sunward slopes were the
colour of rusty gold. At our feet the Aground
fell away into an immense blue gulf. The gauzy
air softened every outline, smoothed away every
detail, leaving only golden lights and violet
shadows floating like the disembodied essence
of a landscape, under the pale sky.

We stood for a long time looking out over that
kingdom of silence and solemn beauty. The

78
MONTESENARIO

solitude was as profound as the shadowy gulf be-
neath us 5 it stretched to the misty horizons and
up into the topless sky. Here at the heart of it,
I thought, a man might begin to understand
something about that part of his being which does
not reveal itself in the quotidian commerce of
life 5 which the social contacts do not draw forth,
spark-like, from the sleeping flint that is an un-
tried spirit | that part of him, of whose very
existence he is only made aware in solitude and
silence. And if there happens to be no silence
in his life, if he is never solitary, then he may
go down to his grave without a knowledge of its
existence, much less an understanding of its nature
or realization of its potentialities.

We retraced our steps to the monastery and
thence walked down the steep path to the motor.
A mile further down the road towards Pratolino,
we met the priestlings returning from their walk,
Poor children ! But was their lot worse, I
wondered, than that of the inhabitants of the
city in the valley ? On their mountain top they
lived under a tyrannous rule, they were taught
to believe in a number of things manifestly silly.
But was the rule any more tyrannous than that
of the imbecile conventions which control the
lives of social beings in the plain ? Was snobbery

79
ALONG  THE  ROAD

about duchesses and distinguished novelists more
reasonable than snobbery about Jesus Christ and
the Saints ? Was hard work to the greater glory
of God more detestable than eight hours a day in
an office for the greater enrichment of the Jews ?
Temperance was a bore, no doubt 3 but was it so
nauseatingly wearisome as excess ? And the
expense of spirit in prayer and meditation�was
that so much less amusing than the expense of
spirit in a waste of shame ? Driving down to-
wards the city in the plain, I wondered. And
when, in the Via Tornabuoni5 we passed Mrs.
Thingummy, in the act of laboriously squeezing
herself out on to the pavement through the door
of her gigantic limousine, I suddenly and per-
fectly understood what it was that had made those
seven rich Florentine merchants, seven hundred
years ago, abandon their position in the world,
and had sent them up into the high wilderness,
to live in holes at the top of Montesenario. I
looked back j Mrs. Thingummy was waddling
across the pavement into the jeweller's shop*
Yes, I perfectly understood.
PATINIR'S  RIVER

JL HE river flows in a narrow valley between
hills. A broad, a brimming and a shining river.
The hills are steep and all of a height. Where
the river bends, the hills on one side jut forward
in a bastion, the hills on the other retreat There
are cliffs, there are hanging woods, dark with
foliage. The sky is pale above this strip of fan-
tastically carved and scalloped earth. A pale sky
from which it must sometimes rain Chinese
white. For there is an ashen pallor over the
rocks ; and the green of the grass and the trees
is tinged with white till it has taken on the colour
of the * Emerald Green ' of children's paint*
boxes.

Brimming and shining river, pale crags, and
trees richly dark, slopes where the turf is the
colour of whitened verdigris�I took these things
for fancies. Peering into the little pictures, each
painted with a million tiny strokes of a four-
haired sable brush, I laughed with pleasure at the
beauty of the charming invention. This Joachim
Patinir, I thought, imagines delicately* For
years I was accustomed to float along that crag-
reflecting river as down a river of the mind, out
of the world.

r                         8si

that it did.    For Patinir was a charming
painter and his surviving works are few.    Two
hundred miles of him would not be at a!] too
much.
PORTOFERRAIO

JL HE sky was Tiepolo?s palette. A cloud of
smoke mounted into the blue5 white where It
looked towards the sun and darkening^ through
the colour of the shadowed folds in a wedding
gown, to grey. In the foreground on the right
a tall pink house went up, glowing like a ger-
anium, into the sunlight There was the stuff
there for a Madonna with attendant saints and
angels ; or a scene from Trojan history ; or a
Crucifixion 5 or one of the little amours of
Jupiter Tonans,

The earth was Mediterranean�a piece of the
Riviera completely surrounded by water. In a
word, Elba. The hills dived down into a hand-
somely curved bay, full of bright, staring blue sea.
On the headland at one end of the bay Porto-
ferraio was piled up in tiers of painted stucco*
At its feet lay a little harbour bristling with m�sts
A smell of fish and the memory of Napoleon
haunted the atmosphere inveterately. Con-
science and Baron Baedeker had told us that we
ought to visit Napoleon's house�now, very
suitably, a natural history museum. But we had
hardened our hearts and would not go. It is very
unpleasant not to have done one's duty. * How
PORTOFERRAIO

tedious Is a guilty conscience/ says the Cardinal
in the Duchess of Malfi. He was quite right.
We had walked the blazing streets groaning under
conviction of sin.

And then, passing through a gateway in the
walls of the old town, we found ourselves con-
fronted by a scene that entirely relieved us of all
our sense of guilt. For we were looking at
something compared with which a house full of
Napoleonic souvenirs was so obviously second-
rate and dull that our rebellion against Baedeker
ceased to be criminal and became positively
meritorious.

Below us, on the further side of a blue inlet of
the sea, and with the mountains behind it, lay a
little piece of the Black Country. In the midst
stood a group of blast furnaces with three huge
chimneys rising from beside them like the bel!
towers of a cathedral. To the right of them
were five or six more chimneys. Three huge
cranes were perched at the water's edge, and an
iron bridge led from the wharves inland to the
furnaces. The chimneys, the cranes, the fur-
naces and buildings, the heap of rubbish, the very
ground in this little area between the Mediter-
ranean and the mountains�all were soot-black.
Black against the sky, black against the golden-

glaucous hills, blackly reflected in the shining"
blue water.

1 should have painted the scene if I had knbwn
how. It was exceedingly beautiful Beautiful
and dramatic too. The mind delights in violent
contrasts. Birmingham is frightful enough where
it is, its body in Warwickshire and its sooty ten-
tacles stretching out across the undulating land
into Stafford. But set it down in Sicily or on the
shores of Lago Maggiore and its frightfulness
becomes at once more painfully apparent. In
Warwickshire it is a full-length sermon on civil-
ization, but one sleeps through sermons. Beside
the Mediterranean it becomes the most bitingly
memorable of epigrams. Moreover, the actual
Birmingham of Warwickshire is too large to be
taken in as a whole. This single piece of black-
ness between the blue sky and the blue sea was
compactly symbolic. And because the sky and
the grass were still visible all round it, the contest
between industrialism and the natural beauties
of the earth was much more vividly realized than
where, as in the great towns of the north, in-
dustrialism has completely triumphed and one is
not even aware of the existence of what has been
conquered.

We stood for a long time, watching the smoke

from the chimneys as it mounted Into tile still air.
White gauze \ white satin5 glossy or shadowed \
feathery grey�Tiepolo's angels hovered ; and
the blue sky was the Madonna's silken robe ; and
the tall pink house on our right was the colour
of one of those very handsome velvets to which,
in the paradise of the last of the Venetians3 the
blest are so excusably partial.
THE PALIO AT SIENA
And their thin, sharp, arrowy cry was speed made
audible. I have sat at my window watching
them tracing their intricate arabesques until I
grew dizzy ; till their shrill crying sounded a^
though from within my ears and their flying
seemed a motion,, incessant, swift and bewilder-
ingly multitudinous5 behind my eyes. And all
the while the sun declined, the shadows climbed
higher up the houses and towers, and the light
with which they were tipped became more rosy
And at last the shadow had climbed to the very
top and the city lay in a grey and violet twilight
beneath the pale sky.

One evening, towards the end of June, as I
was sitting at the window looking at the wheel-
ing birdsj I heard through the crying of the swifts
the sound of a drum* I looked down into the
shadowy street, but could see nothing. Rub-a-
dub, dub, duK> dub�the sound grew louder and
louder, and suddenly there appeared round the
corner where our street bent out of sight, three
personages out of a Plnturicchio fresco?1 They
were dressed in liveries of green and yellow�
yellow doublets slashed and tagged with green,
parti-coloured hose and shoes, with feathered caps
of the same colours. Their leader played the
drum. The two who followed carried green and
ALONG THE ROAD
yellow banners. Immediately below our tower
the street opens out a little into a tiny piazza.
In this clear space the three Pinturicchio figures
came to a halt and the crowd of little boys and
loafers who followed at their heels grouped them-
selves round to watch. The drummer quickened
his beat and the two banner-bearers stepped for-
ward into the middle of the little square. They
stood there for a moment quite still, the right foot
a little in advance of the other, the left fist on the
hip and the lowered banners drooping from the
right. Then, together, they lifted the banners
and began to wave them round their heads. In
the wind of their motion the flags opened out
They were the same size and both of them green
and yellow, but the colours were arranged in a
different pattern on each. And what patterns!
Nothing more 4 modern * was ever seen. They
might have been designed by Picasso for the
Russian Ballet Had they been by Picasso, the
graver critics would have called them futuristic,
the sprightlier (I must apologize for both these
expressions) jazz. But the flags were not
Picasso's $ they were designed some four hun-
dred years ago by the nameless genius who dressed
the Sienese for their yearly pageant. This being
the case, the critics can only take off their hats,

90
THE   PALIO  AT   SIENA

The flags are classical, they are ' High Art;
there is nothing more to be said.

The drum beat on. The bannermen waved
their flags, so artfully that the whole expanse of
patterned stuff was always unfurled and tremu-
lously stretched along the air. They passed the
flags from one hand to the other5 behind their
backs, under a lifted leg. Then, at last, drawing
themselves together to make a supreme effort3
they tossed their banners Into the air. High they
rose5 turning slowly, over and over, hung for an
instant at the height of their trajectory, then
dropped back3 the weighted stave foremost^ to-
wards their throwers, who caught them as they
fell A final wave, then the drum returned to
its march rhythm, the bannermen shouldered
their flags, and followed by the anachronistic
children and idlers from the twentieth century,
Pinturicchio's three young bravos swaggered off
up the dark street out of sight and at length, the
drum taps coming faintlier and ever faintlier,
out of hearing.

Every evening after that, while the swallows
were in full cry and flight about the tower, we
heard the beating of the drum. Every evening,
in %the little piazza below us, a fragment of
Pinturicchio came to life. Sometimes it was our

gi
ALONG  THE   ROAD

friends in green and yellow who returned to wave
their flags beneath our windows. Sometimes it
was men from the other contrade or districts of
the town3 in blue and white^ red and white3 black,
white and orange3 white, green and red3 yellow
and scarlet Their bright pied doublets and
parti-coloured hose shone out from among the
drabs and funereal blacks of the twentieth-century
crowd that surrounded them. Their spread flags
waved In the street below, like the painted wings
of enormous butterflies. The drummer quick-
ened his beat3 and to the accompaniment of a
long-drawn rattle, the banners leapt up, furled
and fluttering,. Into the air.

To the stranger who has never seen a Palio
these little dress rehearsals are richly promising
and exciting. Charmed by these present hint%
he looks forward eagerly to what the day Itself
holds in store. Even the Sienese are excited
The pageant^ however familiar, does not pall on
them. And all the gambler in them, all the local
patriot looks forward to the result of the race.
Those last days of June before the first Palio, that
middle week of August before the seconds are
days of growing excitement and tension in Siena.
One enjoys the Palio the more for having liVed
through them.

92
THE PALIO AT SIENA
Even the mayor and corporation are infected
by the pervading excitement They are so far
carried away that, In the last days of June, they
send a small army of men down in the great
square before the Palazzo Comunale to eradicate
every blade of grass or tuft of moss that can be
found growing in the crannies between the flag- '
stones. It amounts almost to a national char-
acteristic, this hatred of growing things among
the works of men. I have often, in old Italian
towns, seen workmen laboriously weeding the
less frequented streets and squares. The Colos-
seum, mantled till thirty or forty years ago with
a romantic, Piranesian growth of shrubs, grasses
and flowers, was officially weeded with such
extraordinary energy that its ruinousness was
sensibly increased. More stones were brought
down in those few months of weeding than had
fallen of their own accord in the previous thousand
years. But the Italians were pleased 5 which is,
after all, the chief thing that matters. Their
hatred of weeds is fostered by their national
pride 5 a great country, and one which specially
piques itself on being modern, cannot allow weeds
to grow even among its ruins. I entirely under-
stand and sympathize with the Italian point of
view. If Mr. Ruskin and his disciples had

93
ALONG THE ROAD
talked about my house and me as they talked
about Italy and the Italians, I too should pique
myself on being up-to-date 5 I should put in
bathrooms, central heating and a lift, I should
have all the moss scratched off the walls,1 should
Say cork lino on the marble floors. Indeed, I
think that I should probably, in my irritation,
pull down the whole house and build a new one.
Considering the provocation they have received,
it seems to me that the Italians have been re-
markably moderate in the matter of weeding,
destroying and rebuilding. Their moderation
is due in part, no doubt, to their comparative
poverty. Their ancestors built with such pro-
digious solidity that it would cost as much to pull
down one of their old houses as to build a new
one. Imagine, for example, demolishing the
Palazzo Strozzi in Florence. It would be about
as easy to demolish the Matterhorn. In Rome,
which is predominantly a baroque, seventeenth-
century city, the houses are made of flimsier stuff,
Consequently, modernization progresses there
much more rapidly than in most other Italian
towns. In wealthier England very little an-
tiquity has been permitted to stand. Thus, most
of the great country houses of England were
rebuilt during the eighteenth century. If Italy

94
THE PALIO AT SIENA
had preserved her independence and her prosperity
during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, there would probably be very much
less mediaeval or renaissance work now surviving
than is actually the case. Money, then, is lacking
to modernize completely. Weeding has the merit
of being cheap and, at the .same time, richly
symbolic. When you say of a town that the
grass grows in its streets, you mean that it is
utterly dead. Conversely, if there is no grass in
its streets, it must be alive. No doubt the mayor
and corporation of Siena did not put the argument
quite so explicitly. But that the argument was
put, somehow, obscurely and below the surface
of the mind, I do not doubt The weeding was
symbolic of modernity.

With the weeders came other workmen who
built up round the curving flanks of the great
piazza a series of wooden stands, six tiers high,
for the spectators. The piazza which is shaped,
whether by accident or design I "do not know, like
an ancient theatre, became for the time being
indeed a theatre. Between the seats and the
central area of the place, a track was railed off
and the slippery flags covered parsimoniously
with sand. Expectation rose higher than ever.

And at last the day came.    The swallows and

95
ALONG   THE   ROAD

swifts wove their arabesques as usual in the bright
golden light above the town. But their shrill
crying was utterly inaudible., through the deep^
continuous5 formless murmur of the crowd that
thronged the streets and the great piazza. Under
its canopy of stone the great bell of the Mangia
tower swung incessantly backwards and for-
wards ; it too seemed dumb. The talking5 the
laughter, the shouting of forty thousand people
rose up from the piazza in a column of solid
sound5 impenetrable to any ordinary noise.

It was after six. We took our places in one
of the stands opposite the Palazzo Comunale.
Our side of the piazza was already in the shade 5
but the sun still shone on the palace and its tall
slender tower5 making their rosy brickwork glow
as though by inward fire. An immense con-
course of people filled the square and all the tiers
of seats round it. There were people in every
window^ even on the roofs. At the Derby, on
boat-race days, at Wembley I have seen larger
crowds ; but never, I think, so many people
confined within so small a space.

The sound of a gunshot broke through the
noise of voices ; and at the signal a company of
mounted carabiniers rode into the piazza^ driving
the loungers who still thronged the track before
THE PALIO AT SIENA
them. They were in full dress uniform, black
and red5 with silver trimmings 5 cocked hats on
their heads and swords in their hands. On their
handsome little horses, they looked like a squadron
of smart Napoleonic cavalry. The idlers re-
treated before them, squeezing their way through
every convenient opening in the rails into the
central area5 which was soon densely packed.
The track was cleared at a walk and, cleared,
was rounded again at the trot, dashingly, in the
best Carle Vernet style. The carabiniers got
their applause and retired. The crowd waited
expectantly. For a moment there was almost
a silence. The bell on the tower ceased to be
dumb. Some one in the crowd let loose a couple
of balloons. They mounted perpendicularly into
the still air, a red sphere and a purple. They
passed out of the shadow into the sunlight 5 and
the red. became a ruby, the purple a glowing
amethyst. When they had risen above the level
of the roofs, a little breeze caught them and
�carried them away, still mounting all the time,
over our heads, out of sight.

There was another gunshot and Vernet was
exchanged for Pinturicchio. The noise of the
crowd grew louder .as they appeared, the bell
swung, but gave no sound, and across the square

G                         97
ALONG  THE   ROAD

the trumpets of the procession were all but in-
audible. Slowly they marched round5 the repre-
sentatives of all the seventeen contracts of the city.
Besides its drummer and its two bannermen, each
contrada had a man-at-arms on horseback, three
or four halbardiers and young pages and3 if it
happened to be one of the ten competing in the
race3 a jockey3 all of them wearing the Pinturic-
chlan livery in its own particular colours. Their
progress was slow 5 for at every fifty paces they
stopped, to allow the bannermen to give an ex-
hibition of their skill with the flags. They must
have taken the best part of an hour to get round.
But the time seemed only too short. The Palio
is a spectacle of which one does not grow tired.
I have seen it three times now and was as much
delighted on the last occasion as on the first.

English tourists are often sceptical about the
Palio. They remember those terrible * pageants'
which were all the rage some fifteen years ago in
their own country^ and they imagine that the
Palio will turn out to be something of the same
sort. But let me reassure them 5 it is not.
There is no poetry by Louis Napoleon Parker at
Siena, There are no choruses of young ladies
voicing high moral sentiments in low voices.
There are no flabby actor-managers imperfectly
THE PALIO AT SIENA
disguised as Hengist and Horsa, no crowd of
gesticulating supernumeraries dressed in the worst
of taste and the cheapest of bunting. Nor finally
does one often meet at Siena with that almost
invariable accompaniment of the English pageant
�rain. No, the Palio is just a show 5 having
no * meaning * in particular but by the mere fact
of being traditional and still alive, signifying in-
finitely more than the dead-born English affairs
for all their Parkerian blank verse and their dra-
matic re-evocations. For these pages and men-at-
arms and bannermen come straight out of the
Pinturicchian past. Their clothes are those de-
signed for their ancestors, copied faithfully, once
in a generation, in the same colours and the same
rich r materials. They walk, not in cotton or
flannelette, but in silks and furs and velvets. And
the colours were matched, the clothes originally
cut by men whose taste was the faultless taste
of the early renaissance. To be sure there are
costumiers with as good a taste in these days.
But it was not Paquin, not Lanvin or Poiret who
dressed the actors of the English pageants ; it was
professional wig-makers and lady amateurs. I
have already spoken of the beauty of the flags�
the bold, fantastic, * modern' design of them.
Everything else at the Palio is in keeping with

99
ALONG  THE  ROAD

the flags, daring, brilliant and yet always right,
always irreproachably refined. The one false
note is always the Palio itself�the painted banner
which is given to the contrada whose horse wins
the race. This banner is specially painted every
year for the occasion. Look at it, where it comes
along, proudly exposed on the great mediaeval
war chariot which closes the procession�look at
it, or preferably don't look at it. It is a typical
property from the wardrobe of an English pageant
committee. It is a lady amateur's masterpiece.
Shuddering, one averts the eyes.

Preceded by a line of quattrocento pages carry-
ing festoons of laurel leaves and escorted by a
company of mounted knights, the war chariot
rolled slowly and ponderously past, bearing
aloft the unworthy trophy. And by now the
trumpets at the head of'the procession sounded,
almost inaudibly for us, from the further side of
the piazza. And at last the whole procession had
made its round and was lined up in close order in �
front of the Palazzo Comunale. Over the heads
of the spectators standing in the central area, we
could see all the thirty-four banners waving and
waving in a last concerted display and at last,
together, all leaping high into the air, hesitating at
the top of their leap, falling back, out of sight

100
THE   PALIO   AT   SIENA
There was a burst of applause.    The pageant
was over.    Another gunshot    And In the midst
of more applause,, the racehorses were ridden to
the starting place.

The course is three times round the piazza,
whose shape, as I have said, is something like that
of an ancient theatre. Consequently, there are
two sharp turns, where the ends of the semicircle
meet the straight diameter. One of these, owing
to the irregularity of the plan, is sharper than the
other. The outside wall of the track is padded
with mattresses at this point, to prevent impetuous
jockeys who take the corner too fast from dashing
themselves to pieces. The jockeys ride bare-
back 5 the ^horses run on a thin layer of sand
spread over the flagstones of the piazza. The
Palio is probably the most dangerous fiat-race in
the world. And it is made the more dangerous
by the excessive patriotism of the rival contrade.
For the winner of the race as he reins in his
horse after passing the post, is set upon by the
supporters of the other contrade (who all think
that their horse should have won), with so real
and earnest a fury that the carabiniers must always
intervene to protect man and beast from lynching,
Our places were at a point some two or three
hundred yards beyond the post, so that we had an

101
ALONG   THE   ROAD

excellent view of the battle waged round the
winning horse, as he slackened speed. Scarcely
was the post passed when the crowd broke its
ranks and rushed out into the course. Still can-
tering, the horse came up the track. A gang of
young men ran in pursuit, waving sticks and
shouting. And with them, their Napoleonic
coat tails streaming in the wind of their own
speed, their cocked hats bobbing, and brandishing
swords in their white-gloved hands, ran the rescu-
ing carabiniers. There was a brief struggle
round the now stationary horse, the young men
were repulsed, and surrounded by cocked hats,
followed by a crowd of supporters from its native
contrada^ the beast was led off in triumph. We
climbed down from our places. The piazza was
now entirely shaded It was only on the upper
part of the tower and the battlements of the great
Palazzo that the sun still shone. Rosily against
the pale blue sky, they glowed. The swifts still
turned and turned overhead in the light It is said
that at eveningandat dawn theselight-lovingbirds
mount on their strong wings into the sky to bid a
last farewell or earliest good-morrow to the sink-
ing or the rising sun. While we lie sleeping or
have resigned ourselves to darkness the swifts are
looking down from their watch-tower in the

102

height of heaven over the edge of the turning
planet towards the light. Was it a fable^ I
wondered, looking up at the wheeling birds ?
Or was it true ? Meanwhile, some one was
swearing at me for not looking where I was going,
I postponed the speculation.

103
VIEWS OF  HOLLAND

I

HAVE always been  rather  partial to plane
geometry ;   probably because it was the only
branch of mathematics that was ever taught me
in such a way that I could understand it.    For
though I have no belief in the power of education
to turn public school boys into Newtons (it being
quite obvious that, whatever opportunity may be
offered^ it is only those rare beings desirous of
learning and possessing a certain amount of native
ability who ever do learn anything), yet I must
insist. In my own defence, that the system of
mathematical instruction of which, at Eton, I
was the unfortunate victim, was calculated not
nerely to turn my desire to learn into stubborn
massive resistance, but also to stifle whatever rudi-
nentary aptitude in this direction I might have
possessed.    But let that pass.    Suffice to say that,,
n spite of my education and my congenital in-
aptitude, plane geometry has always charmed me
3y its simplicity and elegance, its elimination of
letail and the individual case, its insistence on
generalities.

My love for plane geometry prepared me to
eel a special affection for Holland.    For the
3utch landscape has all the qualities that make
104
VIEWS OF HOLLAND
geometry so delightful A tour in Holland is a
tour through the first books of Euclid, Over a
country that is the ideal plane surface of the
geometry books, the roads and the canals trace
out the shortest distances between point and point.
In the Interminable polders, the road-topped
dykes and gleaming ditches intersect one another
at right angles, a criss-cross of perfect parallels.
Each rectangle of juicy meadowland contained
between the intersecting dykes has identically the
same area. Five kilometres long, three deep�
the figures record.themselves on the clock face of
the-cyclometer. Five by three by�how many ?
The demon of calculation possesses the mind.
Rolling along those smooth brick roads between
the canals, one strains one's eyes to count the
dykes at right angles and parallel to one's own.
One calculates the area of the polders they en-
close. So many square kilometres. But the
square kilometres have to be turned into acres.
It is a fearful sum to do in one's head ; the more
so as one has forgotten how many square yards
there are in an acre.

And all the time, as one advances the huge
geometrical landscape spreads out on either side
of the car like an opening fan. Along the level
sky-line a score of windmills wave their arms like

105
ALONG  THE   ROAD

dancers In a geometrical ballet Ineluctably, the
laws of perspective lead away the long roads and
shining waters to a misty vanishing point. Here
and there�mere real irrelevancies in the midst of
this ideal plain�a few black and white cows out
of a picture by Cuyp browse indefatigably in the
lush green grass or, remembering Paul Potter5
mirror themselves like so many ruminating Nar-
cissi, in the waters of a canal. Sometimes one
passes a few human beings, deplorably out of
place, but doing their best, generally, to make up
for their ungeometrical appearance by mounting
bicycles. The circular wheels suggest a variety
of new theorems and a new task for the demon of
calculation. Suppose the radius of the wheels to
be fifteen inches 5 then fifteen times fifteen times
pi will be the area. The only trouble is that one
has forgotten the value of pi.

Hastily I exorcise the demon of calculation
that I may be free to admire the farm-house on
the opposite 'bank of the canal on our right. How
perfectly it fits into the geometrical scheme !
On a cube, cut down to about a third of its height,
is placed a tall pyramid. That is the house. A
plantation of trees, set in quincunx formation,
surrounds it 5 the limits of its rectangular garden
are drawn in water on the green plain, and beyond

106
VIEWS OF HOLLAND
diese neat ditches extend the interminable flat
fields. There are no outhouses, no bams, no
farm-yard with untidy stacks. The hay is stored
under the huge pyramidal roof, and in the trun-
cated cube below live, on one side the farmer and
his family, on the other side (during winter only ;
for during the rest of the year they sleep in the
fields) his black and white Cuyp cows. Every
farm-house in North Holland conforms to this
type, which is traditional, and so perfectly fitted
to the landscape that it would have been impos-
sible to devise anything more suitable. An
English farm with its ranges of straggling build-
ings, its untidy yard, full of animals, its haystacks
and pigeon-cotes would be horribly out of place
here. In the English landscape, which is all
accidents, variety, detail and particular cases, it is
perfect. But here, in this generalized and Euc-
lidean North Holland, it would be a blot and a
discord. Geometry calls for geometry ; with a
sense of the aesthetic proprieties which one cannot
too highly admire, the Dutch have responded to
the appeal of the landscape and have dotted the
plane surface of their country with cubes and
pyramids.

Delightful landscape !    I know of no country
that it is more mentally exhilarating to travel in.

107
ALONG  THE   ROAD

No wonder Descartes preferred the Dutch to any
other scene. It is the rationalist's paradise.
One feels as one flies along in the teeth of one's
own forty-mile-an-hour wind like a Cartesian
Encyclopaedist�flushed with mental * intoxica-
tion, convinced that Euclid is absolute reality^
that God is a mathematician, that the universe is
a simple affair that can be explained in terms of
physics and mechanics, that all men are equally
endowed with reason and that it is only a question
of putting the right arguments before them to
make them see the error of their ways and to
inaugurate the reign of justice and common sense.
Those were noble and touching dreams, com-
mendable inebriations ! We are soberer now.
We have learnt that nothing is simple and rational
except what we ourselves have invented ; that
God thinks neither in terms of Euclid nor of
Riemann 5 that science has * explained' nothing j
that the more we know the more fantastic the

along the brick-topped dykes between the canals
is deceptive. The present is not eternal; the

is not straight nor regularly curved and its dunes
or its dykes (for it must be defended against the
besieging waves by art if not by nature) rear
themselves inexcusably out of the plane surface.
The woods are unscientific in their shady mysteri-
ousness and one cannot see them for all their
individual trees. The rivers are tortuous and
alive with boats and barges. The inlets of the
sea are entirely shapeless. It is the real world

over5 equally charming with the geometrical land-
scape we have left behind. We shall find it more
charming, indeed, if our minds are practical and
extroverted. Personally3 I balance my affec-
tions. For I love the inner world as much as the
outer. When the outer vexes me, I retire to the
rational simplicities of the inner�to the polders
of the spirit. And when, in their turn, the
polders seem unduly fiat, the roads too straight
and the laws of perspective too tyrannous, I
emerge again Into the pleasing confusion of un~
tempered reality.

And how beautiful, how curious in Holland
that confusion is ! I think of Rotterdam with its
enormous river and its great bridges, so crowded
with the traffic of a metropolis that one has to
wait in files, half a mile long, for one's turn to
cross. I think of The Hague and how it tries to
be elegant and only succeeds in being respectable

with rich mixed rubbish, its huge storehouse of
cheeses, like an old-fashioned arsenal, where the
workmen are busy all day long polishing the
yellow cannon balls on a kind of lathe and paint-
ing them bright pink with an aniline stain.    I
think of Volendam�one line of wooden houses
perched on the sea wall, and another line crouch-
ing in the low green fields behind the dyke.    The
people at Volendam are dressed as for a musical
comedy�Miss Hook of Holland�the men in
baggy trousers and short jackets, the women in
winged white caps, tight bodices, and fifteen super-
Imposed petticoats.    Five thousand tourists come
daily to look at them $  but they still, by some
miracle,  retain   their   independence  and  self-
respect.    I think of Amsterdam 5  the old town,
like a livelier Bruges, mirrors its high brick houses
in the canals.    In one quarter an enormous cour-
tesan sits smiling at every window, the meatiest
specimens of humanity I ever saw     At nine in
the morning, at lunch-time, at six in the afternoon,

thousand bicycles; every one, in  Amsterdam,,

a nightmare.    And they are all trick cyclists.
Children of four carry children of three on their

in

handle-bars. Mothers pedal gaily along with
month-old infants sleeping in cradles fastened to
the back carrier. Messenger boys think nothing
of taking two cubic metres of parcels. Dairymen
do their rounds on bicycles specially constructed
to accommodate two hundred quart bottles of
milk in a tray between the two wheels. I have
seen nursery gardeners carrying four palms and a
dozen of potted chrysanthemums on their handle-
bars. I have seen five people riding through the
traffic on one machine. The most daring feats
of the circus and the music hall are part of the
quotidian routine in Amsterdam.

I think of the dunes near SchoorL Seen from
a little distance across the plain they look like a
range of enormous mountains against the sky.
Following with the eye that jagged silhouette one
can feel all the emotions aroused^ shall we say5 by
the spectacle of the Alps seen from Turin. The
dunes are grand 5 one could write a canto from
Childs Harold about them. And then? unfor-
tunately, one realizes what for a moment one had
forgotten, that this line of formidable peaks is not
looking down at one from fifty miles away, over
the curving flank of the planet $ it is just a fur-
long distant, and the chimneys of the houses at its
base reach nearly two-thirds of the way to the

112

top.    Butfwhat does that matter ?    With a little
good will, I insist, one can feel in Holland ail the
emotions appropriate to Switzerland.

Yes, they are grand, the dunes of Schoorl and
Groet But I think the grandest sight I saw in
non-geometrical Holland was Zaandam�Zaan-
dam from a distance, across the plain.

We had been driving through the polders and
the open country of North Holland. Zaandam
was the first piece of ungeometrical reality since
Alkmaer. Technically, Zaandam is not pictur-
esque ; the guide-book has little to say about it.
It is* a port and manufacturing town on the Zaan,
a few miles north of Amsterdam ; that is all.
They make cocoa there and soap. The air at
Zaandam is charged in alternative strata with
delicious vapours of molten chocolate and the
stench of boiling fat. In wharves by the shores
of the river they store American grain and timber
from the Baltic, It was the granaries that first
announced, from a distance, the presence of Zaan-
dam. Like the cathedrals of a new religion, yet
unpreached, they towered up into the hazy
autumn air�huge oblongs of concrete set on end,
almost windowless, smooth and blankly grey. It
was as though their whole force were directed
vertically upwards ; to look from windows hori-

H                        113
ALONG   THE  ROAD

xontally across the world would have been a
distraction ;  eyes were sacrificed to this upward
purpose.    And the direction of that purpose was
emphasized by the lines of the alternately raised
and lowered panels into which the wall spaces of
the great buildings were divided-*-long fine lines
of shadow running up unbrokenly through a
hundred feet from base to summit    The builders
of the papal palace at Avignon used a very similar
device to give their castle its appearance of enor-
mous height and formidable impendence.    The
raised panel and the shallow blind arches,, impos-
sibly long in the leg, with which they variegated
the surface of the wall. Impart to the whole
building an impetuous upward tendency.    It is
the same with ths grain elevators at Zaandam.
In the haze of autumnal Holland I remembered
Provence.    And I remembered, as I watched
those towering shapes growing larger and larger
as we approached,  Chartres and Bourges and
Reims : gigantic silhouettes seen, at the end of a
day's driving, towards evening, against a pale sky^
with the little lights of a city about their base.

But if at a distance, Zaandam, by its commer-
cial monuments., reminds one of Provencal casdes
and the Gothic cathedrals of France, a nearerview
proclaims it to be unequivocally Dutch. At the

them. Innumerable bicycles. It is the real and
not the ideal geometrical Holland, crowdedj con-
fusing, various5odd5 charming. . . . But I sighed as
we entered the town. Thec Last Ride Together *
was over ; the dear paralogisms of rationalism
were left behind. It was now necessary to face
the actual world of men�and to face it, in my
case^ with precisely five words of Dutch (and
patois at that) learned years before for the benefit
of a Flemish servant: * Have you fed the cat ?'
No wonder I regretted the polders.

115
SABBIONETA

JL HEY call it the Palazzo del Te,' said the
maid at the little inn in the back street where we
had Iunch5 4 because the Gonzaga used to go and
take tea there.' And that was all that she,, and
probably most of the other inhabitants of Mantua,
knew about the Gonzaga or their palaces. It
was surprising, perhaps, that she should have
known so much. Gonzaga�the name, at least,
still faintly reverberated. After two hundred
years, how many names are still remembered ?
Few indeed. The _ Gonzaga, it seemed to me,
enjoy a degree of immortality that might be
envied them. They have vanished, they are as
wholly extinct as the dinosaur j but in the cities
they once ruled their name still vaguely echoes,
and for those who care to listen they have left
behind some of the most eloquent sermons on the
vanity of human wishes and the mutability of
fortune that stones have ever mutely preached.

I have seen many ruins and of every period,
Stonehenge and Ansedonia, Ostia and mediaeval
Ninfa (which the duke of Sermoneta is busily
turning into the likeness of a neat suburban park),
Bolsover and the gruesome modern ruins in
Northern France. I have seen great cities dead
116
SABBIONETA

or in decay : Pisa, Bruges and the newly mur-
dered Vienna. But over nonej it seemed to me,
did there brood so profound a melancholy as over
Mantua ; none seemed so dead or so utterly
bereft of glory 5 nowhere was desolation more
pregnant with the memory of splendour, the
silence nowhere so richly musical with echoes.
There are a thousand rooms in the labyrinthine
Reggia at Mantua�Gothic rooms, rooms of
the renaissance,, baroque rooms, rooms rich with
the absurd pretentious decorations of the first
empire, huge presence chambers and closets and
the horribly exquisite apartments of the dwarfs�
a thousand rooms, and their walls enclose an
emptiness that is the mournful ghost of departed
plenitude. It is through Mallarme's creux nlant
musicien that one walks in Mantua,

And hot in Mantua alone. For wherever the
Gonzaga lived, they left behind them the same
pathetic emptiness, the same pregnant desolation,
the same echoes, the same ghosts of splendour.

The Palazzo del Te is made sad and beautiful
with the same melancholy as broods in the Reggia.
True, the stupid vulgarity of Giulio Romano was
permitted to sprawl over its wall in a series of
deplorable frescoes (it is curious, by the way, that
Giulio Romano should have been the only Italian

117
ALONG  THE  ROAD

artist of whom Shakespeare had ever heard, or at
least the only one he ever mentioned) 5 but the
absurdities and grossnesses seem actually to make
the place more touching. The departed tenants
of the palace become in a manner more real to
one,, when one discovers that their taste ran to
frompe I*ceil pictures of fighting giants and mildly
pornographic scenes out of pagan mythology.
And seeming more human, they seem also more
dead ; and the void left by their disappearance
is more than ever musical with sadness.

Even the cadets of the Gonzaga house enjoyed
a power of leaving behind them a more than Pom-
peian desolation. Twenty miles from Mantua,
on the way to Cremona, is a village called Sab-
bioneta. It lies near the Po, though not on its
banks ; possesses, for a village, a tolerably large
population^ mostly engaged in husbandry 5 is
rather dirty and has an appearance�probably
quite deceptive�of poverty. In fact it is just
like all other villages of the Lombard plain, but
with this difference : a Gonzaga once lived here.
The squalor of Sabbioneta is no common squalor ;
it is a squalor that was once magnificence. Its
farmers and horse-copers live, dirtily and destruc-
tively, in treasures of late renaissance architecture.
The town hall is a ducal palace , in the municipal

118
S ABBIONETA

school, children are taught under carved and
painted ceilings, and when the master is out of the
room they write their names on the marble
bellies of the patient, battered caryatids who
uphold the scutcheoned mantel The weekly
cinema show is given in an Olympic theatre,
built a few years after the famous theatre at
Vicenza, by Palladio's pupil, Scamozzl. The
people worship in sumptuous churches, and if
ever soldiers happen to pass through the town,
they are billeted in the deserted summer palace.

The creator of all these splendours was Ves-
pasiano, son of that Luigi Gonzaga, the boon
companion of kings, whom, for his valour and his
fabulous strength, his contemporaries nicknamed
Rodomonte. Luigi died young, killed in battle 5
and his son Vespasiano was brought up by his
aunt, Giulia Gonzaga, one of the most perfectly
courtly ladies of her age. She had him taught
Latin, Greek, the mathematics, good manners
and the art of war. This last he practised with
distinction, serving at one time or another under
many princes, but chiefly under Philip n. of
�Spain, who honoured him with singular favours.
Vespasiano seems to have been the typical Italian
tyrant of his period�cultured, intelligent and
only just so much of an ungovernably ferocious

119
ALONG   THE   ROAD

ruffian as one would expect a man to be who has
been brought up In the possession of absolute
power. It was In the intimacy of private life
that he displayed his least amiable characteristics.
He poisoned his irst wife on a suspicion-^ probably
unfounded, of her infidelity, murdered her sup-
posed lover and exiled his relations. His second
wife left him mysteriously after three years of
married life and died of pure misery in a convent^
carrying with her into the grave nobody knew
what frightful secret His third wife, it is true,
lived to a ripe old age ; but then Vespasiano
himself died after only a few years of marriage.
His only son5 whom he loved with the anxious
passion of the ambitious parvenu who desires to
found a dynasty^ one day annoyed him by not
taking off his cap when he met him in the street.
Vespasiano rebuked him for this lack of respect.
The boy answered back impertinently. Where-
upon Vespasiano gave him such a frightful kick
in the groin that the boy died. Which shows
that, even when chastising one's own children^,
it is advisable to observe the Queensberry rules.

It was in 1560 that Vespasiano decided to con-
vert the miserable village from which he took his
title into a capital worthy of its ruler. He set to
work with energy. In a few years the village of

120
SABBIONETA

squalid cottages clustering round a feudal castle
had given place to a walled town, with broad
streets, two fine squares, a couple of palaces and
a noble Gallery of Antiques. These last Ves-
pasiano had inherited from his father, Rodomonte,
who had been at the sack of Rome in 1527 and
had shown himself an industrious and discriminat-
ing looter. Sabbioneta was in its turn looted by
the Austrians, who carried off Rodomonte's spoils
to Mantua. The museum remains ; but there
is nothing in it but the creux neant musicun which
the Gonzaga alone, of all the princes in Italy, had
the special art of creating by their departure.

We had come to Sabbioneta from Parma. In
the vast Farnese palace there is no musically
echoing void�merely an ordinary, undisturbing
emptiness. Only in the colossal Estensian theatre
does one recapture anything like the Mantuan
melancholy. We drove through Colorno, where
the last of the Este built a summer palace about as
large as Hampton Court. Over the Po, by a
bridge of boats, through Casalmaggiore and on,
tortuously, by little by-roads across the plain. A
line of walls presented themselves, a handsome
gate. We drove in, and immediately faint
ghostly oboes began to play around us | we were
in Sabbioneta among the Gonzaga ghosts.

121
ALONG THE ROAD
The central piazza of the town is oblong j
Vespasiano's palace stands at one of the shorter
ends, presenting to the world a modest facade,
five windows wide, once rich with decorations,
but now bare. It serves at present as town hall.
In the waiting-room on the first floor, stand four
life-sized equestrian figures, carved in wood and
painted, representing four of Vespasiano's ances-
tors. Once there was a squadron of twelve ;
but the rest have been broken up and burned.
This crime., together with all the other ravages
committed by time or vandals in the course of
three centuries, was attributed by the mayor,
who personally did us the honours of his munici-
pality, to the socialists who had preceded him in
office. It is unnecessary to add that he'himself
was a fascista.

We walked round in the emptiness under the
superbly carved and gilded ceilings. The porter
sat among decayed frescoes in the Cabinet of
Diana. The town council held its meetings in
the Ducal Saloon. The Gallery of the Ancestors
housed a clerk and the municipal archives. The
deputy mayor had his office in the Hall of the
Elephants, The Sala d'Oro had been turned
into an infants' class-room. We walked out
again into the sunlight fairly heart-broken.

122
SABBIONETA

The Olympic Theatre is a few yards down
the street. Accompanied by the obliging young
porter from the Cabinet of Diana3 we entered.
It is a tiny theatre? but complete and marvellously
elegant. From the pit, five semicircular steps
rise to a pillared loggia, behind which�having
the width of the whole auditorium�is the ducal
box. The loggia consists of twelve Corinthian
pillars^ topped by a cornice. On the cornice,
above each pillar5 stand a dozen stucco gods and
goddesses. Noses and fingers, paps and ears
have' gone the way of all art; but the general
form of them survives. Their white silhouettes
gesticulate elegantly against the twilight of
the hall. .

The stage was once adorned with a fixed scene
in perspective3 like that which Palladio built at
Vicenza. The mayor wanted us to believe
that it was his Bolshevik predecessors who had
destroyed it 5 but as a matter of fact it was taken
down about a century ago. Gone5 too? are the
frescoes with which the walls were once covered.
One year of epidemic the theatre was used as a
fever hospital. When the plague had passed, it
was thought that the frescoes needed disinfecting;
they were thickly white-washed. There is no
money to scrape the white-wash off again.

I23
ALONG THE ROAD
We followed the young porter out of the
theatre. Another two or three hundred yards
and we were In the Piazza d'Armi. It Is an
oblong, grassy space. On the long axis of the
rectangle, near one end there stands5 handsomely
pedestalled, a fluted marble column, topped by a
statue of Athena, the tutelary goddess of Ves-
paslano's metropolis. The pedestal, the capital
and the statue are of the late renaissance. But
the column is antique, and formed a part of
Rodomonte's Roman booty. Rodomonte was
evidently no petty thief. If a thing Is worth
doing it Is worth doing thoroughly; that,
evidently, was his motto.

One of the long sides of the rectangle is occu-
pied by the Gallery of Antiques. It is a superb
building, architecturally by far the finest thing in
the town. The lower storey consists of an open
arcade and the walls of the gallery above are
ornamented with blind arches, having well-pro-
portioned windows at the centre of each and
separated from one another by Tuscan pilasters.
A very bold projecting cornice, topped by a low
roof, finishes the design, which for sober and
massive elegance is one of the most remarkable
of its kind with which I am acquainted,

The opposite side of the piazza is open, a hedge
124
SABBIONETA

separating it from the back gardens of the neigh-
bouring houses. It was here, I fancy, that the
feudal castle originally stood. It was pulled
down, however, during the eighteenth century
(busy Bolsheviks !) and its bricks employed, more
usefully but less aesthetically, to strengthen
the dykes which defend the surrounding plain,
none too impregnably, from the waters of
the Po.

Its destruction has left Vespasiano's summer
palace, or Palace of the Garden, isolated (save
where it joins the Gallery of the Antiques), and
rather forlorn at the end of the long piazza. It
is a long, low building of only two storeys, rather
insignificant from outside. It is evident that
Vespasiano built it as economically as he could.
For him the place was only a week-encl cottage,
a holiday resort, whither he could escape from the
metropolitan splendour and bustle of the palace in
the market-place, a quarter of a mile away. Like
all other rulers of small states, Vespasiano must
have found it extremely difficult to take an effec-
tive holiday. He could not go ten miles in any
direction without coming to a frontier. Within
his dominions it was impossible to have a change
of air. Wisely, therefore, he decided to concen-
trate his magnificences. He built his Balmoral

125
ALONG  THE   ROAD

within five minutes' walk of his Buckingham
Palace.

We knocked at the door. The caretaker who
opened to us was an old woman who might have
gone on to any stage and acted Juliet's Nurse
without a moment's rehearsal. 'Within the first
two minutes of our acquaintance with her she
confided to us that she had just got married�for
the third time5 at the age of seventy. Her com-
ments on the connubial state were so very Juliet's
Nurse, so positively Wife-of~Baths that we were
made to feel quite early-Victorian In comparison
with this robustious old gammer from the quattro-
cento. After having told us all that can be told
(and much that cannot be told, at any rate in
polite society) about the married state3 she pro-
ceeded to do us the honours of the house. She
led the way> opening the shutters of each room In
the long suite, as we entered It. And as the light
came in through the unglazed windows, what
Gonzagesque ravishments were revealed to us.
There was a Cabinet of Venus, with the remains
of voluptuous nudeSj a Hall of the Winds with
puffing cherubs and a mantel in red marble ; a
Cabinet of the Caesars, floored with marble and
adorned with medallions of all the ruffians of
antiquity $ a Hall of the Myths on whose ceiling^

126
SABBIONETA

vaulted into the likeness of a truncated pyramid
seen from within, were five delightful scenes from
Lempriere�an Xcaras, an Apollo and Marsyas?
a Phaeton3 an Arachne and, in the midst, a to
me somewhat mysterious scene: a naked beauty
sitting on the back3 not of a bull (that would have
been simple enough), but of a reclining horse,
which turns its head amorously towards her? while
she caresses its neck. Who was the lady and who
the travestied god I do not rightly know. , Vague
memories of an escapade of Saturn's float through
my mind. But perhaps I am slandering a re-
spectable deity.

But in any case3 whatever its subject, the pic-
ture is charming. Vespasiano's principal artist
was Bernardino Campi of Cremona. He was
not a good painter, of course ; but at least he
was ' gracefully and charmingly, instead of
vulgarly mediocre, like Giulio Romano.
About the Palazzo del Te there hangs a
certain faded frightfulness 5 but the Giardino is
all sweetness�mannered, no doubt, and rather
feeble�but none the less authentic in its
ruinous decay.

The old caretaker expounded the pictures to us
as we went round�not out of any knowledge of
what they represented, but purely out of her

127
ALONG THE ROAD
imagination, which was a good deal more inter-
esting. In the Hall of the Graces, where the
walls are adorned with what remains of a series
of very pretty little grotteschi in the Pompeian
manner, her fancy surpassed itself. These, she
said, were the records of the Duke's dreams.
Each time he dreamed a dream he sent for his
painter and had it drawn on the walls of this room.
These�she pointed to a pair of Chimaeras�he
saw in a nightmare ; these dancing satyrs visited
his sleep after a merry evening ; these four urns
were dreamt of after too much wine. As for
the three naked Graces, from whom the room
takes its name, as for those�over the Graces
she once more became too Wife-of-Bath to be
recorded.

Her old cracked laughter went echoing down
the empty rooms $ and it seemed to precipitate
and crystallize all the melancholy suspended, as it
were, in solution within those bleared and peeling
walls. The sense of desolation, vaguely felt
before, became poignant. And when the old
woman ushered us into another room, dark and
smelling of mould like the rest, and threw open
the shutters and called what the light revealed the
* Hall of the Mirrors,' I could almost have wept
For in the Hall of the Mirrors there are no more

mirrors, only the elaborate framing of them on
walls and ceiling. , Where the glasses of Murano
once shone are spaces of bare plaster that stare out
like blind eyes, blankly ands it seems after a little,
.reproachfully. 'They used to dance In this

how they moved, what lessons they taught !
There had been no religious painting like Land-

These historical considerations should make
us chary of believing too exclusively in any
single theory of art. One kind of painting^
one set of ideas are fashionable at any given
moment They are made the basis of a theory
which condemns all other kinds of painting and
all preceding critical theories. The process con-

At the present moment, it is true5 we have
achieved an unprecedently tolerant eclecticism.
We are able, if we are up-to-date, to enjoy every-
thing, from negro sculpture to Lucca della Robbia
and from Magnasco to Byzantine mosaics. But
it is an eclecticism achieved at the expense of
almost the whole content of the various works of
art considered. What we have learned to see in
all these works is their formal qualities, which we
abstract and arbitrarily call essential. The sub-
ject of the work, with all that the painter desired
to express in it beyond his feelings about formal
relations, contemporary criticism rejects as unim-
portant. The young painter scrupulously avoids

*34
BREUGHEL

Introducing into his pictures anything that might
be mistaken for a story, or the expression of a
view of life, while the young Kunstforssher turns,
as though at an act of exhibitionism, from any
manifestation by a contemporary of any such for-
bidden interest in drama or philosophy. True,,
the old masters are indulgently permitted to illus-
trate stories and express their thoughts about the
world. Poor devils, they knew no better !
Your modern observer makes allowance for their
ignorance and passes over in silence all that is not
a matter of formal relations. The admirers of
Giotto (as numerous to-day as were the admirers
of Guido Reni a hundred years ago) contrive,to
look at the master's frescoes without considering
what they represent, or what the painter desired
to express. Every*germ of drama or meaning is
disinfected out of them 5 only the composition is
admired. The process is analogous toc reading
Latin verses without understanding them�
simply for the sake of the rhythmical rumbling
of the hexameters.

It would be absurd, of course, to deny the im-
portance of formal relations. No picture can
hold together without composition and no good
painter is without some specific passion for form
as such�just as no good writer is without a
ALONG   THE  ROAD

passion for words and the arrangement of words.
It is obvious that no man can adequately express
himself, unless he takes an interest in the terms'
which he proposes to use as his medium of expres-
sion. Not all painters are interested in the same
sort of forms. Some, for example, have a passion
for masses and the surfaces of solids. Others
delight in lines. Some compose in three dimen-
sions. Others like to make silhouettes on the
fiat Some like to make the surface of the paint
smooth andj as it were, translucent, so that the
objects represented in the picture can be seen dis-
tinct and separate, as through a sheet of glass.
Others (as for example Rembrandt) love to make
a rich thick surface which shall absorb and draw
together into one whole all the objects repre-
sentedj and that in spite of the depth of the com-
position and the distance of the objects from the
plane of the picture. All these purely aesthetic %
considerations are, as I-have said, important. All
artists are interested in them j but almost none
are interested in them to the exclusion of every-
thing else. It is very seldom indeed that we find
a painter who can be inspired merely by his
interest in form and texture to paint a picture.
Good painters of * abstract' subjects or even of
still lives are rare. Apples and solid geometry do
136
BREUGHEL

not stimulate a man to express his feelings about
form and make a composition. All thoughts and
emotions are inter-dependent. In the words of
the dear old song,

The roses round the door
Make me love mother more.

One feeling is excited by another. Our faculties
work best in a congenial emotional atmosphere.
For example, Mantegna's faculty for making
noble arrangements of forms was stimulated by
his feelings about heroic and god-like humanity.
Expressing those feelings, which he found excit-
ing, he also "'expressed�and in the most perfect
manner of which he was capable�his feelings
about masses, surfaces, solids, and voids. ' The
roses round the door '�his hero worship�* made
him love mother more'�made him, by stimulat-
ing his faculty for composition, paint better. If
Isabella d'Este had made him paint apples, table
napkins and bottles, he would have produced,
being uninterested in these objects, a poor com-
position. And yet, from a purely formal point
of view, apples, bottles and napkins are quite as
Interesting as hitman bodies and faces. But
Mantegna�and with him the majority of
painters�did not happen to be very passionately
ALONG  THE  ROAD

interested in these inanimate objects.    When
one is bored one becomes boring.

The apples round the door
Make me a frightful bore.

Inevitably 5 unless I happen to be so exclus-
ively interested in form that I can paint anything
that has a shape 5 or unless I happen to possess
some measure of that queer pantheism3 that ani-
mistic superstition which made Van Gogh regard
the humblest of common objects as being divinely
or devilishly alive. e Grains dans le mur aveugle
un regard qul t'epie.' If a painter can do that) he
will be ables like Van Gogh3 to make pictures of
cabbage fields and' the bedrooms of cheap hotels
that shall be as wildly dramatic as a Rape of the
Sabines,

The contemporary fashion is to admire beyond
all others the painter who can concentrate on the
formal side of his art and produce pictures which
are entirely devoid of literature. Old Renoir's
apophthegnij * Un peintre> voyez-vouS) qui a le
sentiment du teton et des fesses ^ est un homme sauvej
is considered by the purists suspiciously latitudin-
arian. A painter who has the sentiment of the
pap and the buttocks is a painter who portrays real
models with gusto. Your pure aesthete should

138
BREUGHEL

only have a feeling for hemispheres, curved lines
and surfaces. But this 4 sentiment of the but-
tocks ' is common to all good painters. It is the
lowest common measure of the whole profession.
It is possible, like Mantegna, to have a pas-
sionate feeling for all that is solid, and at the same
time to be a stoic philosopher and a hero-wor-
shipper i possible, with Michelangelo, to have
a complete realization of breasts and also an
interest in the soul or, like Rubens, to have a
sentiment for human greatness as well as for
human rumps. The greater includes the less j
great dramatic or reflective painters know every-
thing that the aestheticians who paint geometrical
pictures, apples or buttocks know, and a great deal
more besides. What they have to say about
formal relations, though important, is only a part
of" what they have to express. The contem-
porary insistence on form to the exclusion of
everything else is an absurdity. So was the older
insistence on exact imitation and sentiment to the
exclusion of form. There need be no exclusions.
In spite of the single name, there are many
different kinds of painters and all of them, with
the exception of those who cannot paint? and those
whose minds are trivial, vulgar and tedious, have
a right to exist.

139
ALONG THE ROAD
All classifications and theories are made after
the event ; the facts must first occur before they
can be tabulated and methodized. Reversing the
historical process, we attack the facts forearmed
with theoretical prejudice. Instead o� consider-
ing each fact on Its own merits., we ask how it
fits into the theoretical scheme. At'any given
moment a number of meritorious facts fail to fit
into the fashionable theory and have to be ignored.
Thus El Greco's art failed to conform with the
ideal of good painting held by Philip the Second
and his contemporaries. The Sienese primitives
seemed to the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-
turies incompetent barbarians. Under the In-
fluence of Ruskin, the later nineteenth century
contrived to dislike almost all architecture that
was not Gothic. And the early twentieth cen-
tury, under the influence of the French, deplores
and ignores, in painting, all that is literary,
reflective or dramatic.

In every age theory has caused men to like
much that was bad and reject much that was good.
The only prejudice that the ideal art critic should
have is against the incompetent, the mentally
dishonest and the futile. The number of ways
in which good pictures can be painted is quite
incalculable, depending only on the variability of
140
BREUGHEL

the human mind. Every good painter Invents a
new way of painting. Is this man a competent
painter ? Has he something to say, is he genuine ?
These are the questions a critic must ask himself.
Not, Does he conform with my theory of imita-
tion, or distortion, or moral purity, or significant
form ?

There is one painter against whom, it seems to
me, theoretical prejudice has always most un-
fairly told. I mean the elder Breughel Look-
ing at his best paintings I find that I can honestly
answer in the affirmative all the questions which
a critic may legitimately put himself. He is
highly competent aesthetically 5 he has plenty to
say ; his mind is curious, interesting and power-
ful 5 and he has no false pretensions, is entirely
honest And yet he has never enjoyed the high
reputation to which his merits entitle him. This
is due, I think, to the fact that his work has never
quite squared with any of the various critical
theories which since his days have had a vogue
in the aesthetic world.

A subtle colourist, a sure and powerful
draughtsman, and possessing powers of composi-
tion that enable him to marshal the innumerable
figures with which his pictures are filled into pleas-
ingly decorative groups (built up, as we see, when

141
ALONG  THE   ROAD

we try to analyse his methods of formal arrange-
ment, out of individually flat, silhouette-like
shapes standing in a succession of receding planes),
Breughel can boast of purely aesthetic merits
that ought to endear him even to the strictest sect
of the Pharisees. Coated with this pure aesthetic
jam, the bitter pill of his literature might easily,
one would suppose, be swallowed. If Giotto's
dalliance with sacred history be forgiven him,
why may not Breughel be excused for being an
anthropologist and a social philosopher ? To
which I tentatively answer : Giotto is forgiven,
because we have so utterly ceased to believe in
Catholic Christianity that we can easily ignore
the subject matter of his pictures and concentrate
only on their formal qualities j -Breughel, on the
other hand, is unforgivable because he made
comments on humanity that are still interest-
ing to us. From his subject matter we cannot
escape ; it touches us too closely to be ignored.
That is why Breughel is despised by all uprto-date
Kunstforschers.

And even in the past, when there was no theor-
etical objection to the mingling of literature and
painting, Breughel failed, for another reason, to
get his due. He was considered low, gross, a
mere co/nedian, and as such unworthy of serious

142
BREUGHEL

consideration. Thus, the Encyclopaedia Brit-
annica^ which in these matters may be safely
relied on to give the current opinion of a couple of
generations ago, informs us, in the eleven lines
which it parsimoniously devotes to Peter Breughel
that * the subjects of his pictures are chiefly hum-
orous figures, like those of D. Teniers ; and if
he wants the delicate touch and silvery clearness
of that master, he has abundant spirit and comic
power.9

Whoever wrote these words�and they might
have been written by any one desirous, fifty years
ago, of playing for safety and saying the right
thing�can never have taken the trouble to look
at any of the pictures painted by Breughel when
he was a grown and accomplished artist

In his youth, it is true^ he did a great deal of
hack work for a dealer who specialized in cari-
catures and devils in the manner of Hieronymus
Bosch. But his later pictures, painted when he
had really mastered the secrets of his art, are not
comic at all. They are studies of peasant life,
they are allegories, they are religious pictures of
the most strangely reflective cast, they are ex-
quisitely poetical landscapes. Breughel died at
the height of his powers. But there is enough of
his mature work in existence�at Antwerp, at

143
ALONG THE ROAD
Brussels, at Naples and above all at Vienna�to
expose the fatuity of the classical verdict and
exhibit him for what he was : the first landscape
painter of his century the acutest student of
manners, and the wonderfully skilful pictorial
expounder or suggester of a view of life. It is at
Vienna, indeed, that Breughel's art can best be
studied in all its aspects. For Vienna possesses
practically all his best pictures of whatever kind.
The scattered pictures at Antwerp, Brussels,
Paris, Naples and elsewhere give one but the
faintest notion of Breughel's powers. In the
Vienna galleries are collected more than a dozen
of his pictures, all belonging to his last and best
period. The Tower of Babel, the great Calvary,
the Numbering of the People at Bethlehem, the
two Winter Landscapes and the Autumn Land-
scape, the Conversion of Saint Paul, the Battle
between the Israelites and the Philistines, the
Marriage Feast and the Peasants' Dance�all
these admirable works are here. It is on these
that he must be judged.

There are four landscapes at Vienna :   the
Dark Day (January) and Huntsmen in the Snow
(February), a November landscape (the Return*
of the Cattle), and the Numbering of the People
at Bethlehem which in spite of its name is little

144
BREUGHEL

more than a landscape with figures. This last
like the February Landscape and the Massacre oi
the Innocents at Brussels5 is a study of snow.
Snow scenes lent themselves particularly well tc
Breughel's style of painting. For a snowy back-
ground has the effect of making all dark oi
coloured objects seen against it appear in the
form of very distinct^ sharp-edged silhouettes.
Breughel does in all his compositions what the
snow does in nature. All the objects in his
pictures (which are composed in a manner that
reminds one very much of the Japanese) are
paper-thin silhouettes arranged3 plane after plane^
like the theatrical scenery in the depth of the stage.
Consequently in the painting of snow scenes,,
where nature starts by. imitating his habitual
method., he achieves an almost disquieting degree
of fundamental realism. Those hunters stepping
down over the brow of the hill towards the snowy
valley with its frozen ponds are Jack Frost him-
self and his crew. The crowds who move about
the white streets of Bethlehem have their being
in an absolute winter? and those ferocious troopers
looting and innocent-hunting in the midst of a
Christmas card landscape are a part of the very
army of winter, and the innocents they kill are
the young green shoots of the earth.

K                       H5
ALONG THE ROAD
Breughel's method is less fundamentally com-
patible with the snowless landscapes of January
and November. The different planes stand apart
a little too flatly and distinctly. It needs a softer,
bloomier kind of painting to recapture the in-
timate quality of such scenes as those he portrays
in these two pictures. A born painter of Autumn,
for example, would have fused the beasts, the men,
the trees and the distant mountains into a hazier
unity, melting all together, the near and the far,
in the rich surface of his paint. Breughel painted
too transparently and too flatly to be the perfect
interpreter of such landscapes. Still, even in
terms of his not entirely suitable convention he
has done marvels. The Autumn Day is a thing
of the most exquisite beauty. Here, as in the
more sombrely dramatic January Landscape, he
makes a subtle use of golds and yellows and
browns, creating a sober yet luminous harmony
of colours. The November Landscape is en-
tirely placid and serene j but in the Dark Day he
has staged one of those natural dramas of the sky
and earth�a conflict between light and darkness.
Light breaks from under clouds along the horizon,
shines up from the river in the valley that lies in
the middle distance, glitters on the peaks of the
mountains. The foreground, which represents

146
BREUGHEL

the crest of a wooded hill, is dark ; and the leafless
trees growing on the slopes are black against the
sky. These two pictures are the most beautiful
sixteenth-century landscapes of which I have any
knowledge. They are intensely poetical, yet
sober and not excessively picturesque or romantic.
Those fearful crags and beetling precipices of
which the older painters were so fond do not
appear in these examples of Breughel's maturest
work.

Breughel's anthropology is as delightful as his
nature poetry He knew his Flemings, knew them
intimately, both in their prosperity and during the
miserable years of strife, of rebellion, of persecu-
tion, of war and consequent poverty which followed
the advent of the Reformation in Flanders.

A Fleming himself, and so profoundly and
ineradicably a Fleming that he was able to go to
Italy, and, like his great countryman in the
previous century, Roger van der Weyden, return
without the faintest tincture of Italianism�he
was perfectly qualified to be the natural historian
of the Flemish folk. He exhibits them mostly in
those moments of orgiastic gaiety with which
they temper the laborious monotony of their daily
lives ; eating enormously, drinking, uncouthly
dancing, indulging in that peculiarly Flemish

147
ALONG  THE  ROAD

scatological waggery. The Wedding Feast and
^ the Peasants' Dance5 both at Vienna, are superb
examples of this anthropological type of painting.
Nor must we forget those two curious pictures,
the Battle between Carnival and Lent and the
Children's Games. They too show us certain
aspects of the joyous side of Flemish life. But
the view is not of an individual scene, casually
seized at its height and reproduced. These two
pictures are systematic and encyclopaedic . la-crie
he illustrates all childrej^*^mljs 5 in the other,,
all the amusements of carnival, with all the forces
arrayed on the side of asceticism. In the same
way he represents, in his extraordinary Tower of
Babel, all the processes of building. These pic-
tures are handbooks of their respective subjects. "
Breughel's fondness for generalizing and sys-
tematizing is further illustrated in his allegorical
pieces. The Triumph of Death, at the Prado,
is appalling in its elaboration and completeness.
The fantastic * Dulle Griet' at Antwerp is an
almost equally elaborate triumph of evil. His
illustrations to proverbs and parables belong to the
same class. They show him to have been a man
profoundly convinced of the reality of evil and of
the horrors which this mortal life, not to mention
eternity, hold in store for suffering humanity,

148
BREUGHEL

The world is a horrible place $ but in spite of
this, or precisely because of this, men and women
eat, drink and'dance. Carnival tilts against Lent
and triumphs, if only for a moment 5 children
play in the streets, people get married in the
midst of gross rejoicings.

But of all Breughel's pictures the one most
richly suggestive of reflection is not specifically
allegorical or systematic. Christ carrying the
Cross is one of his largest canvases, thronged
with small figures rhythmically grouped against
a wide and romantic background. The com-
position is simple, pleasing in itself, and seems
to spring out of the subject instead of being
imposed on it. So much for pure aesthetics.

Of the Crucifixion and the Carrying of the
Cross there are hundreds of representations by the
most admirable and diverse masters. But of all
that I have ever seen this Calvary of Breughel's
is the most suggestive and, dramatically, the most
appalling. For all other masters have painted
these dreadful scenes from within, so to speak,
outwards. For them Christ is the centre, the
divine -hero of the tragedy 5 this is the fact from
which they start j it affects and transforms all the
other facts, justifying, in a sense, the horror of the
drama and ranging all that surrounds the central

149
ALONG  THE  ROAD

figure in an ordered hierarchy of good and
evil. Breughelj on the other hand, starts
from the outside and works inwards. He re-
presents the scene as it would have appeared
to any casual spectator on the road to Golgotha
on a certain spring morning in the year 33 A. D.
Other artists have pretended to be angels, painting
the scene with a knowledge of its significance,
But Breughel resolutely remains a human on-
looker. Wnat he shows is a crowd of people
walking briskly in holiday joyfulness up the slopes
of a hill On the top of the hill, which is seen in
the middle distance on the right, are two crosses
with thieves fastened to them, and between them
a little hole in the ground in which another cross
is soon to be planted. Round the crosses, on the
bare hill top stands a ring of people, who have
come out with their picnic ^baskets to look on at
the free entertainment offered by the ministers of
justice. Those who have already taken their
stand round the crosses are the prudent ones 5 in
these days we should see them with camp stools
and thermos flasks, six hours ahead of time, in the
vanguard of the queue for a Melba night at
Covent Garden. The less provident or more
adventurous people are in the crowd coming up
the hill with the third and greatest of the criminals

150
BREUGHEL

whose cross is to take the place of honour between
the other two. In their anxiety not to miss any
of the fun on the way up, they forget that they
will have to take back seats at the actual place of
execution. But it may be, of course, that they
have reserved their places, up there. At Tyburn
one could get an excellent seat in a private box for
half a crown 5 with the ticket in one's pocket,
one could follow the cart all the way-from the
prison, arrive with the criminal and yet have a
perfect view of the performance. In these later
days, when cranky humanitarianism has so far
triumphed that hangings take place in private and
Mrs. Thompson's screams are not even allowed
to be recorded on the radio, we have to be content
with reading about executions, not with seeing
them. The impresarios who sold seats at Tyburn
have been replaced by titled newspaper proprietors
who sell juicy descriptions of Tyburn to a pro-
digiously much larger public. If people were
still hanged at Marble Arch, Lord Riddell would
be much less rich.

That eager, tremulous, lascivious interest in
blood and beastliness which in these more civil-
ized days we can only satisfy at one remove from
reality in the pages of our newspapers, was frank-
lier indulged in Breughel's day ; the naive in-

151
ALONG  THE   ROAD

genuous brute in man was less sophisticated, was
given longer rope, and joyously barks and wags
its tail round the appointed victim. Seen thus,
impassively, from the outside, the tragedy does
not purge or uplift ; it appals and makes desper-
ate* 5 or it may even inspire a kind of gruesome
mirth. The same situation may often be either
tragic or comic, according as it is seen through the
eyes of those who suffer or those who look on,
(Shift the point of vision a little and Macbeth could
be paraphrased as a roaring farce.) Breughel
makes a concession to the high tragic convention
by placing in the foreground of his picture a little
group made up of the holy women weeping and
wringing their hands. They stand quite apart
from the other figures in the picture and are
fundamentally out of harmony with them, being
painted in the style of Roger van der Weyden.
A little oasis of passionate spirituality, an island
of consciousness and comprehension in the midst
of the pervading stupidity and brutishness. Why
Breughel put them jnto his picture is difficult to
guess 5 perhaps for the benefit of the conven-
tionally religious, perhaps out of respect for
tradition; or perhaps he found his own creation
too depressing and added this noble irrelevance
to reassure himself.

RIMINI AND ALBERTI

was honoured, that morning, by the
presence of three distinguished visitors � our-
selves and the Thaumaturgical Arm of St. Francis
Xavier. Divorced from the rest of the saint's
remains, whose home is a jewelled tabernacle in
the church of Jesus at Old Goa, the Arm, like
ourselves, was making an Italian tour. But
while we poor common tourists were spending
money on the way, the Thaumaturgical Arm �
and this was perhaps its most miraculous achieve-
ment � was raking it in. It had only to show
itself through the crystal window of the reliquary
in which it travelled � a skeleton arm, with a huge
amethyst ring still glittering on one of the fingers
of its bony hand � to command the veneration of
all beholders and a copper collection, thinly inter-
spersed with nickel and the smallest paper. The
copper collection went to the foreign missions :
what happened to the veneration, I do not ven-
ture to guess. It was set down, no doubt, with
their offered pence, to the credit of those who felt
it, in the recording angel's book

I felt rather sorry for St. Francis Xavier's arm.
The body of the saint, after translation from
China to Malacca and from Malacca to India,
ALONG  THE   ROAD

now reposes, as I have said, in the gaudy shrine
at Goa. After a life so extraordinarily strenuous
as was his, the great missionary deserves to rest
in peace. And so he does, most of him. But
his right arm has had to forgo its secular quiet 5
its missionary voyages are not yet over. In its
gold and crystal box it travels indefatigably
through catholic Christendom collecting pence�
4 for spoiling Indian innocence,' as Mr. Matthew
Green tersely and rather tartly put it, two hundred
years ago. Poor Arm !

We found it, that morning, in the church of
San Francesco at Rimini. A crowd of adorers
filled the building and overflowed Into the street
outside. The people seemed to be waiting rather
vaguely In the hope of something thaurnaturgica!
happening. Within the church, a long queue of
men and women shuffled slowly up into the choir
to kiss the jewelled bone-box and deposit their
soldi* Outside, among the crowd at the door of
the church, stood a number of hawkers, selling
picture postcards of the Thaumaturgical Arm and
brief but fabulous biographies of its owner. We
got into conversation with one of them, who told
us that he followed the Arm from town to town,
selling his wares wherever It stopped to shpw
Itself. The business seemed a tolerably profit-
RIMINI AND ALBERTI
able one j it enabled him, at any rate5 to keep a
wife and family living in comfort at Milan. He
showed us their photographs ; mother and chil-
dren�they all looked well nourished. But, poor
fellow ! his business kept him almost unin-
terruptedly away from home. 4 What does one
marry for ? * he said as he put the photographs
back into his pocket. 4 What ? * He sighed
and shook his head. If only the Arm could be
induced to settle down for a little !

During the lunch hour the Arm was taken for
a drive round Rimini. Red and yellow counter-
panes were hung out of all the windows in its
honour ; the faithful waited impatiently. And
at last it came, driving in a very large, very noisy
and dirty old Fiat, accompanied, not, as one might
have expected, by the ecclesiastical dignitaries of
the city, but by seven or eight very secular young
men in black shirts, with frizzy hair, their trouser
pockets bulging with automatic pistols�the com-
mittee of the local fascio, no doubt.

The Arm occupied the front seat, next the
driver : the fascists lolled behind. As the car
passed^ the faithful did a very curious thing 5
mingling the gestures of reverence and applaus^
they fell on their knees and clapped their hands;
The Arm was treated as though it were a com-

155
ALONG  THE -ROAD

bination of Jackie Coogan and the Host. After
lunch, it was driven rapidly away to Bologna.
The vendors of sacred pictures followed as fast as
the Italian trains would take them, the crowd
dispersed and the church of San Francesco re-
verted to its habitual silence.

For this we were rather glad 5 for it was not to
see a fragment of St. Francis Xavier that we had
conie to Rimini ; it was to look at the church of
St. Francis of AssisL Sight-seeing, so long as the
Arm was there, had been impossible 5 its de-
parture left us free to look round at our ease,
Still, I was very glad that we had seen the peri-
patetic relic and its adorers in San Francesco. In
this strange church which Malatesta found a
Christian temple,, rebuilt in pagan form and re-
dedicated to himself, his mistress and the humani-
ties, the scenes we had just witnessed possessed a
certain piercing incongruousness that provoked�
the wit of circumstances�a kind of meditative
mirth. I tried to imagine what the first St.
Francis would have thought of Sigismondo Mala-
testa, what Sigismondo thought of him and how
he would have regarded the desecration of his
Nietzschean temple by this posthumous visit of a
bit of the second St. Francis. One can imagine
a pleasant little Gobinesque or Lucianic dialogue

the southern wall, Aiberti has pierced a series of
deep arched niches. Recessed shadow alternates
harmoniously down a long perspective with
smooth sunlit stone 5 and in every niche, plain
and severe like the character of an early Roman
in the pages of Plutarch3 stands the sarcophagus
of a scholar or a philosopher. There is nothing
here of St. Francis's pre-lapsarian ingenuousness.
Aiberti is an entirely conscious adult 5 he wor-
ships, but worships reason, rationally. The
whole building is a hymn to intellectual beauty,
an exaltation of reason as the only source of
human greatness. Its form is Roman ; for
Rome was the retrospective Utopia in which
such men as Alberti, from the time of the Renais-
sance down to a much later date, saw the fulfil-
ment of their ideals. The Roman myth dies
hard, the Greek harder still ; there are certain
victims of a classical education who still regard
the Republic as the home of all virtues and see
in Periclean Athens the unique repository of
human intelligence.

Malatesta would have got a better personal
apotheosis if he had lived in a later century.
AlBerti was too ^severe and stoical an artist to
condescend to mere theatrical grandiosity. Nor,
indeed, was the art of being grandiose really

158
RIMINI AND ALBERTI
understood till the seventeenth century, the age
of baroque, of kingly and clerical display. The
hard-working missionary, whose arm we had seen
that morning in Malatesta's temple, reposes at
Goa in the sort of surroundings that would be
perfectly suitable in a tyrant's self-raised shrine.
Alberti's monument, on the contrary, is a tribute
to intellectual greatness. As a memorial to a
particularly cunning and murderous ruffian it is
absurd.

In the interior of the church, it is true, Mala-
testa had things all his own way, Alberti was
not there to interfere in his scheme of decoration,
so that Sigismondo was able to dictate to Matteo
de' Pasti and his colleagues all the themes of their
carving. The interior is consequently one vast
personal tribute to Malatesta and Isotta, with an
occasional good word in favour of the pagan gods,
of literature, art and science. The too expressive
theatrical gesture of the baroque architects and
decorators had not yet been invented , Sigis-
mondo's vulgar tyranny is consequently celebrated
in the most perfect taste and in terms of a delicate
and learned fantasy. Sigismondo got better than
his deserts ; he deserved Borromini, the Cavaliere
Arpino and a tenth-rate imitator of Bernini.
What he actually got, owing to the accident of

his date, was Matteo de' Pasti, Piero della Fran-
ceses, and Leon Battista Albert!.

Alberti's share in the monument, then. Is a
kind of hymn to intellectual beauty, a paean in
praise of civilization, couched in the language of
Rome�but freely and not pedantically employed^
as the philosophers and the poets of the age em-
ployed the Latin idiom* To my mind5 he was
almost the noblest Roman of them all The
exterior of San Francesco at Rimini5 the interior
of Sant* Andrea at Mantua (sadly daubed about
by later decorators and with Juvara's absurd high-
drummed cupola in the midst instead of the saucer
dome designed by Alberti himself) are as fine as
anything in the whole range of renaissance archi-
tecture. What renders them the more remark-
able is that they were without precedent,, in his
age, Alberti was "one of the re-inventors of the
style. Of his particular Roman manner, indeed
(the manner which became the current idiom of
the later renaissance) he was the sole re-dis-
coverer. The other early renaissance manner,
based, like Alberti's, on the classics�the manner
of Brunelleschi�was doomed, so far at any rate
as ecclesiastical architecture was concerned, to
extinction. Sant' Andrea at Mantua is the
model from which the typical churches of the

160
RIMINI   AND   ALBERTI
later renaissance were imitated, not Brunelleschi's
Florentine San Lorenzo or Santo Spirito.

A comparison between these nearly contem-
porary architects�Brunelleschi was born some
twenty-five yearsbefore Alberti�is extremely in-
teresting and instructive.   Both were enthusiastic
students of the antique, both knew their Rome,
both employed in their buildings the characteristic
elements of classical architecture.    And yet it
would be difficult to discover two architects whose
work is more completely dissimilar.    Compare
the interiors of Brunelleschi's two Florentine
churches with that of Alberti's Sant* Andrea.
Brunelleschi's churches are divided into a nave
*nd aisles by rows of tall slender pillars supporting
round arches.   The details are classical and so
correct that they might have been executed by
Roman workmen.    But the general design is not
Roman, but Romanesque.    His churches are
simply more spidery versions of eleventh-century
basilicas, with 'purer'details.    All is airiness
and lightnas -, there is even a certain air of in-
security about these church interiors, so slender
are the pillars, so much free space is to be seen.

What a contrast with Albert's great church I
It is built in the form of a Latin cross, with a
single ijave and side chapels. The nave is barrel-

vaulted ; over the crossing is a dome (Juvara's,
unfortunately, not Alberts) ; the altar is pkced
in an apse. The chapels Open on to the central
nave by tall, and proportionately wide, round-
headed arches. Between each of the chapels is
a gigantic pier of masonry, as wide as the arches
which they separate. A small door fe pierced [R

doors are inconspicuous and the general effect
is one of void and Solid equany alternating.
Alberti's is essentially the architecture of masse%
Brunelleschi's of lines. Even to the enormous
dome of Santa Maria del Fiore Brunelleschi con-
tnves to impart an extraordinary lightness, as of
lines with voids between them. The huge mass
hangs aerially from its eight ribs of marble. A
miracle is effortlessly Consummated before our
eyes. But a dome, however light you make it,
is essentially an afikir of ^^ Jn designing

ably the finest thing he ever made. He was not
permuted by the nature of the architectural
problem to be solved to give free play to his
passion for lightness and the fine line. He was
162
RIMINI AND ALBERTI
dealing here with masses 5 it could not be escaped.
The result was that, treating the mass of the dome
as far as was possible in terms of light, strong, leap-
ing lines, he contrived to impart to his work an
elegance and an aerial strength such as have never
been equalled in any other dome. The rest of
Brunelleschi's work, however charming and
graceful, is, to my mind at any rate, far less
satisfying, precisely because it "is so definitely an
affair of lines. Brunelleschi studied the archi-
tecture of the Romans 5 but he took from it only
its details. What was essential in it�its majestic
massiveness�did not appeal to him. He pre-
ferred, in all his church designs, to refine and
refine on the work of the romanesque architects,
until at last he arrived at a slender and precarious
elegance that was all vacuum and outline.

Alberti, on the other hand, took from the
Romans their .fundamental conception of an
architecture of masses and developed it, with
refinements, for modern, Christian uses. To my
mind, he was the better and truer architect of the
two. For I personally like massiveness and an
air of solidity. Others, I know, prefer lines and
lightness and would put the interior of San
Lorenzo above that .of Sant' Andrea, the Pazzi
chapel above San Francesco at EiminL We shall

163
ALONG  THE   ROAD

never be reconciled.    All who practise the visual
arts ands presumably, all who appreciate them
must have some kind of feeling for form as such.
But not all are interested in the same kind of
forms.    The lovers of pure line and the lovers of
mass stand at opposite ends of an aesthetic scale.
The aesthetic passion of one artist, or one art
Iover5 is solidity ; another is moved only by linear
arabesques on a flat surface.    Those formal pas-
sions may be misplaced.    Painters may be led by
their excessive love of three-dimensional solidity
quite beyond the field of painting $ Michelangelo
is an obvious example.    Sculptors with too great
a fondness for mere linear effect cease to be
sculptors, and their work is no more than a flat
decoration in stone or metal, meant to be seen
from only one point of view and having no depth j
the famous  Diana attributed to Goujon (but
probably by Benvenuto Cellini) is one of these
statues conceived in the flat.    Just as painters
must not be too fond of solidity, nor sculptors too
much attached to flatness, so, it seems to me,
no architect should be too exclusively interested
in lines.    Architecture in the hands of a linear
enthusiast   takes on the too   slender, spidery
elegance of Brunelleschi's work.

The psycho-analysts, who trace all interest in
164
RIMINI AND ALBERTI
art back to an infantile love of excrement, would
doubtless offer some simple faecal explanation
for the varieties in our aesthetic passions. One
man loves masses, another lines: the explanation
in terms of coprophily is so obvious that I may be
excused from giving it here. I will content
myself by quoting from the works of Dr. Ernest
Jones, the reason why the worship of form should
come to be connected in so many cases with the
worship of a moral ideal ; in a word, why art Is so
often religious. ' Religion/ says Dr. Jones,fi has
always used art in one form or another, and must
do so5 for the reason that incestuous desires in-
variably construct their phantasies out of the
material provided by the unconscious memory of
infantile coprophilic interests 5 that is the inner
meaning of the phrase, " Art is the handmaid of
Religion." ' Illuminating and beautiful words !
It is a pity they were not written thirty years ago.
I should have liked to read Tolstoy's comments
in What is Art ? on this last and best of the
aesthetic theories.

CONXOLUS

T,

o know what everybody else knows�that
Virgil, for example, wrote the Aeneld^ or that
the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to
two right angles�is rather boring and undistin-
guished. If you want to acquire a reputation for
learning at a cheap rate, it is best to ignore the
dull and stupid knowledge which is everybody's
possession and concentrate on something odd and
out of the way. Instead of quoting Virgil quote
Sidonius Apollinaris, and express loudly your
contempt of those who prefer the court poet of
Augustus to the panegyrist of Avitus, Majorianus
and Anthemius. When the conversation turns on
Jane Eyre or Wuthenng Heights (which of course
you have not read) say you infinitely prefer The
Tenant of Wlldfell Hall. When Donne is praised,
pooh-pooh him and tell the praiser that he should
read Gongora. At the mention of Raphael,
make as - though to vomit outright (though
you have never been inside the Vatican) � the
Raphael Mengses at Petersburg, you will say,
are the only tolerable paintings. In this way
you ^will get the reputation of a person of pro-
found learning and the most exquisite taste.
Whereas, if you give proof of knowing youi

166
CONXOLUS

Dickens, of having read the Bible, the English
classics, Euclid and Horace, nobody will think
anything of you at all You will be just like
everybody else.

The extreme inadequacy of my education has
often led me, in the course of my journalistic
career, to adopt these tactics. I have written
airily of the remote and odd in order to conceal
my ignorance of the near and the classical. The
profession of a literary journalist is not one that
greatly encourages honesty. Everything con-
spires to make him a charlatan. He has no
leisure to read regularly or with purpose ; at the
same time reviewing makes him acquainted with
a mass of fragmentary and miscellaneous informa-
tion. He would be a prodigy of intellectual in-
tegrity if he did not reproduce it in his own
articles, casually and with confidence, as though
each queer item were an outlying promontory of
the vast continent of his universal knowledge.
Moreover the necessity under which he labours
of always being readable tempts him at all costs
to be original and unusual. Is it to be wondered
at if, knowing five lines each of Virgil and
Apollinarisj he prefers to quote the latter ? Or
if, knowing none of Virgil, he turns his ignorance
into a critical virtue and lets it be understood that

167
ALONG   THE   ROAD

the best minds have now gone on from Maro to
Sidonius ?

In the monastery of Subiaco, which lies in that
remote back of beyond behind Tivoli, there are,
among many other things of beauty and historical
interest, a number of frescoes by a thirteenth-
century master, unknown except as the author of
these works, called Conxolus,. The name is
superb and could not be improved. Majestic
and at the same time slightly grotesque, un-
common (indeed, for all I know, unique) and
easily memorable, it is a name which seems by-
right to belong to a great man. Conxolus : at
the sound of those rich syllables the cultured
person has a vague uncomfortable feeling that he
ought to know what they connote. Is it a
battle ? or scholastic philosophy ? or a heresy ?
or what ? Learning, after a moment's agonizing
suspense (during which he is uncertain whether
his Interlocutor will let out the secret or force him
to confess his ignorance) that Conxolus was a
painter, the cultured person confidently plunges.
4 Such a marvellous artist ! * he rapturously
exclaims.                                                *

The old journalistic Adam is not quite dead
within me, and I know my cultured society.
The temptation was strong. I would preach

168
CONXOLUS

Conxolus to a benighted world and, exalting him
as an artist, exalt myself at the same time as an art
critic. And how cheaply ! For the price of
three gallons of petrol, ten francs of post-cards and
tips, and an excellent lunch, with trout, at Tivoli,
I should have made myself completely master of
my "subject and established my Kunstforscher's
reputation. No tiresome journeys to far away
galleries in search of the master's minor works,
no laborious reading of German monographs.
Just this one extremely agreeable trip to the upper
Anio, this forty minutes' walk uphill, this little
trot round Saint Benedict's first hermitage�and
that was all I would go back to London, I
would write some articles, or even a little book,
with handsome reproductions, about the master.
And when, in cultured society, people talked of
Duccio or Simone Martini, I should smile from
the height of my superiority. * They are all very
well, no doubt. But when one has seen Conx-
olus.9 And I should go on talking of his tactile
and olfactory values, his magistral treatment of
the fourth dimension, his exquisitely subtle use
of repoussoirs and that extraordinary mastery of
colour which enabled him to paint all the flesh in
his pictures in two tones of ochre, impure purple
and goose-turd green. And my auditors (terri-

169
ALONG THE ROAD
fied? as all the frequenters of cultured society
always are, of being left behind in the intellectual
race), would listen with grave avidity. And they
would leave me, triumphantly conscious that they
had scored a point over their rivals, that they had
entered a new swim from which all but the ex-
tremely select were excluded, that their minds
were dressed in a fashion that came straight from
Paris (for of course I should give them to under-
stand that Derain and Matisse entirely agreed
with me); and from that day forth the name of
ConxoluSj and with it my name, would begin to
reverberate, crescendo^ with an ever-growing
rumour of admiration, in all the best drawing-
rooms, from Euston to the World's End.

The temptation was strong; but I wrestled
with it heroically and at last had the mastery. 1
decided that I would not pervert the truth for
the sake of any reputation, however fiatteringj
for critical insight and discrimination. For the
truth, alas, is that our unique and high-sounding
Conxolus is an entirely negligible painter. Com-
petent and well-trained j but no more. His
principal merit consists in the fact that he lived in
the thirteenth century and worked in the char-
acteristic style of his period. He painted in the
decadent Byzantine manner which we, arguing

170
GONXOLUS

backwards from sixteenth-century Florence in-
stead of forwards from sixth-century Ravenna,
miscall � primitive.* It is in this, I repeat, that
his principal merit consists�at any rate for us.
For a century ago his primitiveness would only
have aroused derision and pity. We have changed
all that nowadays j and so thoroughly that there
are many young people who, in their anxiety not
to be thought old-fashioned, regard all pictures
bearing a close resemblance to their subjects as
highly suspicious and, unless guaranteed chemic-
ally pure by some recognized aesthetic authority,
a priori ridiculous. To these ascetics all natural
beauty, when reproduced by art, is damnable. A
beautiful woman accurately painted is * chocolate
boxy ? 5 a beautiful landscape mere poetry. If a
work of art is obviously charming, if it moves at
first sight, then, according to these people, it must
also necessarily be bad. This doctrine applied to
music has led to the exaltation of Bach, even Bach
in his most mechanical and soulless moments, at
the expense of Beethoven. It has led to the dry
6 classical' way of playing Mozart, who is sup-
posed to be unemotional because he is not vulgarly
emotional, like Wagner. It has led to steam
organ-like performances of Handel and senseless
bellowings of Palestrina." And the absurd young,

171
ALONG  THE   ROAD

in reaction against the sentimentalities and lach-
rymose idealisms which they imagine to have
characterized the later Victorian age, being left
absolutely unmoved by these performances, have
for that very reason applauded them as in the
highest degree artistic. It is the same in painting,,
The muddier the colours, the more distorted the
figures, the higher the art. There are hundreds
of young painters who dare not paint realistically
and charmingly, even if they could, for fear of
losing the esteem of the young connoisseurs who
are their patrons. True, good painters paint well
and express all they have to say whatever conven-
tion they may use ; and indifferent painters paint
indifferently in all circumstances. It ought,
therefore, to give us no concern whatever if in-
different young painters do prefer distortion and
muddy colouring to gaiety, realism and charm.
It does not seriously matter how they paint. At
the same time the world did get a certain amount
of entertainment out of its indifferent painters in
the past, when they did their best to imitate nature
and tell stories. It got faithful copies of beautiful
objects, it got documents and pictorial notes, it
got amusing anecdotes and comments on life.
These things might not be great pictures 5 but
they were at any rate worth something, for they

172
CONXOLUS

had an other than aesthetic value. Aiming as he
does at some mythical ideal of pure aestheticism^
to which all but form is sacrificed, the young
talentless painter of the present time gives us
nothing but boredom* For his pictures are not
good pictures, and they do not make amends for
their badness by reminding us of pleasing objects ;
they have not even the merit of being documents
or comments, they do not even tell a story. In a
word they have nothing to recommend them.
From being an entertainer, the second-rate artist
(if he happens also to be * advanced ') has become
an intolerable bore.

The young's mistrust of realism does not apply
only to contemporary art 5 it is also retrospective.
Of two equally untalented artists of the past youth
unhesitatingly prefers the man who is least real-
istic, most 'primitive/ Conxoius is admired
above his seventeenth-century counterpart, simply
because his figures remind one of nothing that is
charming in nature, because he is innocent of
light and shade, because the composition is rigidly
symmetrical and because the emotional content
of his ardently Christian pictures has, for us,
completely evaporated, leaving nothing that can
evoke in our bosoms the slightest sentiment of any
kind, with the single exception of those famous

173
ALONG  THE  ROAD

aesthetic emotions which the young so studiously
cultivate.

True, the convention in which the seven-
teenth-century Italian painters worked was an
intolerable one. The wild gesticulations with
which they filled their pictures, in the hope of
artificially creating an atmosphere of passion, is
fundamentally ludicrous. The baroque style and
the kindred romantic style are the two styles best
fitted in the nature of things for the expression of
comedy. Aristophanes, Rabelais, Nashe, Balzac,
Dickens, Rowlandson, Goya, Dore, Daumierand
the nameless makers of grotesques all over the
world and at every period�all practitioners of
pure comedy, whether in literature or in art�
have employed an extravagant, baroque, romantic
style. Naturally \ for pure comedy it is essenti-
ally extravagant and enormous. Except in the
hands of prodigious men of genius (sifth as .Mar-
lowe and Shakespeare, Michelangelo and Rem-
brandt) this style, when used for serious purposes,
is ludicrous. Almost all baroque art and almost
all the kindred romantic art of a later epoch are
grotesque because the artists (not of the first order)
are trying to express something tragic in terms of a
style essentially comic. In this respect the works
of the & primitives '�even of the second-rate
174
CONXOLUS

primitives�are really preferable to the works of
their seicento descendants. For in their pictures-
there is no fundamental incongruity between the
style and subject But this is a negative quality 5
second-rate primitives are decent but they are ex-
traordinarily dull. The work of the later realists
may be vulgar and absurd as a whole i but it is
redeemed, very often, by the charm of its details.
You can find, in the pictures of second-rate artists
of the seventeenth century, charming landscapes,
interesting physiognomies, studies of curious
effects of light and shade�things which do no-
thing, it is true, to redeem these works, viewed as
wholes, from badness, but are nevertheless agree-
able and interesting in themselves. In the Conx-
oluses of an earlier epoch the work as a whole is
respectable 5 but its dullness is not relieved by any
curious or delightful details. By their absurdly
ascetic distrust of the obviously delightful, the
young have deprived themselves of a great deal of
pleasure. They bore themselves by second-rate
Conxqluses when they might amuse themselves
by equally second-rate Fetis and Caravaggios and
Rosa da Tivolis and Carpionis and Guercinos
and Luca Giordanos and all the rest of them.
If one must look at second-rate pictures at all
�and there are so few good pictures that one"
ALONG   THE   ROAD

inevitably must�it is surely more reasonable to
look at those which give one something (even
though the plums be embedded in a suet of horror)
than those which give one absolutely nothing
at all

176
THE BEST PICTURE

JOoRGO SAN SEPOLCRO Is not very easy to get
at. There is a small low-comedy railway across
the hills from Arezzo. Or you can approach it
up the Tiber valley from Perugia. Or5 if you
happen to be at Urbino, there is a motor 'bus which
takes you to San Sepolcro, up and down through
the Apennines, in something over seven hours.
No joke., that journey, as I know by experience.
But it is worth doing, though preferably in some
other vehicle than the 'bus, for the sake of the
Bocca Trabaria, that most beautiful of Apennine
passes, between the Tiber valley and the upper
valley of the Metauro. It was in the early spring
that we crossed it. Our omnibus groaned and
rattled slowly up a bleak northern slope, among
bald rocks, withered grass and still unbudded
trees. It crossed the col and suddenly, as though
by a miracle, the ground was yellow with innum-
erable primroses, each flower a little emblem of
the sun that had called it into being,

And when at last one has arrived at San
Sepolcro, what is there to be seen ? A little
town surrounded by walls, set in a, broad flat
valley between hills ; some fine renaissance
palaces with pretty balconies of wrought iron i

M                         177
ALONG  THE  ROAD

a not very interesting church, and finally, the
best picture in the world.

The best picture in the world is painted in
fresco on the wall of a room in the town hall.
Some unwittingly beneficent vandal had it
covered, some time after it was painted, with a
thick layer of plaster, under which it lay hidden
for a century or two, to be revealed at last in a
state of preservation remarkably perfect for a
fresco of its date. Thanks to the vandals, the
visitor who now enters the Palazzo dei Con-
servator! at Borgo San Sepolcro finds the stupend-
ous Resurrection almost as Piero della Franceses
left it. Its clear, yet subtly sober colours shine
out from the wall with scarcely impaired fresh-
ness. Damp has blotted out nothing of the
design, nor dirt obscured it. We need no imagin-
ation to help us figure forth its beauty ; it stands
there before us in entire and actual splendour3 the
greatest picture in the world.

The greatest picture in the world. . . . You
smile. The expression is ludicrous, of course.
Nothing is more futile than the occupation of
those connoisseurs who spend their time compil-
ing first and second elevens of the world's best
painters, eights and fours of musicians, fifteens of
poets, all-star troupes of architects and so on.
THE  BEST  PICTURE
Nothing Is so futile because there are a great many
kinds of merit and an Infinite variety of human
beings.    Is Fra Angelico a better artist than
Rubens ?    Such questions, you insist, are mean-
ingless.    It is all a matter of personal taste.    And
up to a point this is true.    But there does exist,
none the less, an absolute standard of artistic
merit.    And it is a ^andard which is in the last
resort a moral one.    Whether a work of art is
good or bad depends entirely on the quality of
the character which expresses itself in the work.
Not that all virtuous men are good artists, nor all
artists conventionally virtuous.    Longfellow was
a bad poet, while Beethoven's dealings with his
publishers were frankly dishonourable.    But one
can be dishonourable towards one's publishers and
yet preserve the kind of virtue that is necessary to
a good artist.    That virtue is the virtue of in-
tegrity, of honesty towards oneself.    Bad art is
of two sorts :  that which is merely dull, stupid
and incompetent, the negatively bad 5   and the
positively bad, which is a lie and a sham.    Very
often the lie is so well told that almost every one
is taken in by it�for a time.    In the end, how-
ever, lies are always found out.   Fashion changes,
the public learns to look with a different focus and,
where a little while ago it saw an admirable work

179
ALONG  THE   ROAD

which actually moved its emotions, it now sees a
sham. In the history of the arts we find in-
numerable shams of this kind, once taken as
genuine, now seen to be false. The very names
of most of them are now forgotten. Still, a dim
rumour that Ossian once was read, that Bulwer
was thought a great novelist and 6 Festus 5 Bailey
a mighty poet still faintly reverberates. Their
counterparts are busily earning praise and money
at the present day. 1 often wonder if I am one
of them. It is impossible to know. For one
can be an artistic swindler without meaning to
cheat and in the teeth of the most ardent desire
to be honest.

Sometimes the charlatan is also a first-rate man
of genius and then you have such strange artists
as Wagner and Bernini, who can turn what is
false and theatrical into something almost sublime.

That it is difficult to tell the genuine from the
sham is proved by the fact that enormous numbers
of people have made mistakes and continue to
make them. Genuineness, as I have said, always
triumphs in the long run. But at any given
moment the majority of people, if they do not
actually prefer the sham to the real, at least like
it as much, paying an indiscriminate homage to
both.

180
THE BEST PICTURE
And now5 after this little digression we can
return to San Sepolcro and the greatest picture in'
the world. Great it is5 absolutely great5 because
the man who painted it was genuinely noble as
well as talented. And to me personally the most
moving of pictures3 because its author possessed
almost more than any other painter those qualities
of character which I most admire and because his
purely aesthetic preoccupations are of a kind
which I am by nature best fitted to understand.
A natural, spontaneous and unpretentious gran-
deur�this is the leading quality of all Piero's
work. He is majestic without being at all
strained5 theatrical or hysterical�as Handel is
majestic^ not as Wagner. He achieves grandeur
naturally with every gesture he makes5 never
consciously strains after it. Like Alberti^ with
whose architecture, as I hope to show,, his paint-
ing has certain affinities5 Piero seems to have been
inspired by what I may call the religion of
Plutarch's Lives�which is not Christianity, but
a worship of what is admirable in man. Even
his technically religious pictures are paeans in
praise of human dignity. And he is everywhere
intellectual.

With the drama of life and religion he is very
little concerned.   His battle pictures at Arezzo

are not dramatic compositions in spite of the ms
dramatic incidents they contain. All the turin
all the emotions of the scenes have been diges

is as though Bach had written the 1812 Overti
Nor are the two superb pictures in the Natio
Gallery�the Nativity and the Baptism�s
tinguished for any particular sympathy with
religious or emotional significance of the eve
portrayed. In the extraordinary Flagellatior
Urbino, the nominal subject of the picture rece
into the background on the left-hand side of
panelj where it serves to balance the three m
terious figures standing aloof in the right fc
ground. We seem to have nothing here but
experiment in composition., but an experimen
strange and so startlingly successful that we do
regret the absence of dramatic significance ;
are entirely satisfied. The Resurrection at S
Sepolcro is more dramatic. Piero has made
simple triangular composition symbolic of
subject. The base of the triangle is formed
the sepulchre ; and the soldiers sleeping roun
are made to indicate by their position the upw
j et of the two sides, which meet at the apex in
face of the risen Christ, who is standing, a ban
In his right hand, his left foot already raised e<

THE BEST PICTURE
planted on the brim of the sepulchre, preparing to
set out into the world. No geometrical arrange-
ment could have been more simple or more apt.
But the being who rises before our eyes from the
tomb Is more like a Plutarchian hero than the
Christ of conventional religion. The body Is
perfectly developed, like that of a Greek athlete ;
so formidably strong that the wound in its mus-
cular flank seems somehow an irrelevance. The
face is stern and pensive, the eyes cold. The
whole figure is expressive of physical and intel-
lectual power. It is the resurrection of the
classical Ideal,, incredibly much grander and more
beautiful than the classical reality, from the tomb
where It had lain so many hundred years.

Aesthetically, Piero's work has this resem-
blance to Alberti's : that It too Is essentially
an affair of masses. What Albert! Is to Brunel-
leschl, Piero della Francesca Is to his contempo-
rary, Botticelli. Botticelli was fundamentally a
draughtsman, a maker of supple and resilient
lines, thinking in terms of arabesques inscribed
on the fiat. Piero, on the contrary, has a passion
for solidity as such. There is something in all
his works that reminds one constantly of Egyptian
�sculpture. Piero has that Egyptian love of the
smooth rounded surface that is the external symbol

183
ALONG THE ROAD
and expression of a mass. The faces of his per-
sonages look as though they were carved out o1
some very hard rock into which it had beer
impossible to engrave the details of a faumar
physiognomy�the hollows, the lines and wrinkle
of real life. They are ideal, like the faces <y
Egyptian gods and princes, surface meeting anc
xiianying with curved unbroken surface in ar
almost geometrical fashion. Look3 for example
at the faces of the women in Piero's fresco a
Arezzo : ' The Queen of Sheba recognizing th<
Holy Tree.* They are all of one peculiar cast
the foreheads are high, rounded and smooth 5 th<
necks are like cylinders of polished ivory ; fron
the midst of the concave sockets the eyelids swel
out in one uninterrupted curve into convexity
the cheeks are unbrokenly smooth and the subtl
curvature of their surfaces is indicated by a ver
delicate chiaroscuro which suggests more power
fully the solidity and mass of the flesh than th
most spectacular Caravaggioesque light and shad
could do.

Piero's passion for solidity betrays itself no les
strikingly in his handling of the dresses am
drapery of his figures. It is noticeable, for ex
ample, that wherever the subject permits, h
makes his personages appear in curious head

THE BEST PICTURE
dresses that remind one by their solid geometrical
qualities of those oddly-shaped ceremonial hats or
tiaras worn by the statues of Egyptian kings.
Among the frescoes at Arezzo are several which
illustrate this peculiarity. In that representing
Heraclius restoring the True Cross to Jerusalem^
all the ecclesiastical dignitaries are wearing
enormously high head-dresses, conical, trumpet-
shaped, even rectangular. They are painted
very smoothly with, it is obvious, a profound
relish for their solidity. One or two similar
head-dresses, with many varieties of wonderfully
rounded helmets, are lovingly represented in the
battle-pieces in the same place. The Duke of
Urbino, in the well-known portrait at the Uffizi,
is wearing a/ed cloth cap whose shape is some-
what like that of the * Brodrick* of the modern
English soldier, but without the peak�a cylinder
fitting round the head, topped by a projecting disk
as the crown. Its smoothness and the roundness
of its surfaces are emphasized in the picture. Nor
does Piero neglect the veils of his female figures.
Though transparent and of lawn, they hang
round the heads of his women in stiff folds, as
though they were made of steel. Among clothes
he has a special fondness for pleated bodices and
tunics. The bulge and recession of the pleated

185
ALONG  THE  ROAD

stuff fascinates him and he likes to trace the way
in which the fluted folds follow the curve of the
body beneath. To drapery he gives, as we might
<expect3 a particular weight and richness. Per-
haps his most exquisite handling of drapery is to
be seen in the altar-piece of the Madonna della
Misericordia, which now hangs near the Resur-
rection in the town hall at San Sepolcro. The
central figure in this picture, which Is one of the
earliest of Piero's extant works, represents the
Virgin^ standing, and stretching out her arms, so
as to cover two groups of suppliants on either side
with the folds of her heavy blue mantle. The
mantle and the Virgin's dress hang in simple
perpendicular folds, like the flutings on the robe
of the archaic bronze charioteer at the Louvre.
Plero has painted these alternately convex and
concave surfaces with a peculiar gusto.

It is not my intention to write a treatise on
Piero della Francesca ; that has been done suffi-
ciently often and sufficiently badly to make it
unnecessary for me to bury that consummate
artist any deeper under layers of muddy comment.
All I have meant to do In this place is to give the
reasons why I like his works and my justifications
for calling the Resurrection the greatest picture in
the world. I am attracted to his character by his

186
THE BEST PICTURE
intellectual power 5 by his capacity for unaffect-
edly making the grand and noble gesture ; by his
pride in whatever is splendid in humanity. And
in the artist I find peculiarly sympathetic the lover
of solidity, the painter of smooth curving surfaces,
the composer who builds with masses. For my-
self I prefer him to Botticelli, so much so indeed,
that if it were necessary to sacrifice all Botticelli's
works in order to save the Resurrection, the
Nativity, the Madonna della Misericordia and the
Arezzo frescoes, I should unhesitatingly commit
the Primavera and all the rest of them to the
flames. It is unfortunate for Piero's reputation
that his works should be comparatively few and
in most cases rather difficult of access. With the
exception of the Nativity and Baptism at the
National Gallery, all the really important works
of Piero are at Arezzo, San Sepolcro and Urbino.
The portraits of the Duke and Duchess of Urbino
with their respective triumphs, in the Uffizi, are
charming and exceedingly c amusing ' 5 but they
do not represent Piero at his best. The altar-
piece at Perugia and the Madonna with saints and
donor at Milan are neither of them first-rate.
The St. Jerome at Venice is goodish 5 so too is
the damaged fresco of the Malatesta, at Rimini.
The Louvre possesses nothing and Germany can
ALONG   THE   ROAD

only boast of a study of architecture, inferior to
that at Urbino. Anybody, therefore, who wants
to know Piero, must go from London to Arezzo^
San Sepolcro and Urbino. Now Arezzo is a
boring sort of town, and so ungrateful to its
distinguished sons that there is no monument
within its walls to the divine Aretino, I deplore
Arezzo ; but to Arezzo, nevertheless, you must
go to see Piero's most considerable works. From
Arezzo you must make your way to San Sepolcro,
where the inn is only just tolerable, and to which
the means of communication are so bad that,
unless you come in your own car, you are fairly
compelled to stay there. And from San Sepolcro
you must travel by 'bus for seven hours across the
Apennines to Urbino. Here, it is true, you have
not only two admirable Pieros (the Flagellation
and an architectural scene), but the most exquisite
palace in Italy and very nearly a good hotel.
Even on the most wearily reluctant tourist
Urbino Imposes itself ; there is no escaping it \
it must be seen. But in the case of Arezzo and
San Sepolcro there is no such moral compulsion.
Few tourists, in consequence, take the trouble
to visit them.

If the principal works of Piero were to be seers
In Florence, and those of Botticelli at San Sepolcro

188
THE   BEST  PICTURE

1 do not doubt that the public estimation of these
two masters would be reversed. Artistic English
spinsters would stand in rapturous contemplation
before the story of the True Cross, instead of
before the Primavera. Raptures depend largely
upon the stars in Baedeker, and the stars are more
freely distributed to works of art in accessible
towns than to those in the inaccessible. If the
Arena chapel were in the mountains of Calabria,
instead of at Padua, we should all have heard a
good deal less of Giotto.

But enough. The shade of Conxolus rises up
to remind me that I am running into the error of
those who measure merit by a scale of oddness
and rarity.

THE   PIERIAN SPRING

. LITTLE learning,,9 said Pope^4 is a danger-
ous thing.' And who, indeed3 should have known
its dangers more intimately than the man who had
undertaken to translate Homer without (for all
practical purposes) knowing a word of Greek ?
* Drink deep J�the exhortation, you fee!5 comes
from the translator's very heart�4or taste not
the Pierian spring.'

Drink deep. The advice is good5 provided
always that the liquor be a sound one. But is the
Pierian spring sound ? That is the question.
Not all medicinal waters are good for every
drinker. People who can profitably drink deep
of Carlsbad or Montecatini may die of a surfeit of
Bath. Similarly the Pierian spring is not for
everybody. The philosopher and the man of
science may drink of it as deeply as they like and
it will do them nothing but good. To the poet
it can certainly do no harm 5 his native wood-
notes are enriched by a little learning. The
politician would do well to drink of this spring
more often and more copiously than he actually
does. The man of business may find profit in
the draughty while the dilettante drinks for mere
pleasure. But there is at least one class of men

190
THE   PIERIAN   SPRING
to whom the Pierian spring seems to be almost
fatal    On no account should the artist be allowed
to drink of it

Two centuries have passed since Pope warned
his readers against the dangers of a little learning.
The history of those two centuries, and especially
of the last fifty years, has proved that, so far as the
artist is concerned, much learning is quite as
dangerous as little learning. It is, in fact, a great
deal more dangerous.

I can best explain what happens when artists
drink deep of the Pierian spring by describing a
kir^d of Arts and Crafts exhibition which I hap-
pened to see, a summer or two since, in Munich.
It was a huge affair. Furniture, jewellery,,
ceramics, textiles�every kind of applied art was
copiously represented. And all the exhibits were
German. All German�and yet these pots and
pans, these chairs and tables, these weavings,
paintings, carvings, forgings spoke a hundred
languages besides the native Teuton. Aryan,
Mongolian, Semitic, Bantu, Polynesian, Maya�
the stocks and stones of Munich were fluent in
all the tongues. Here, for example, stood a
Mexican pot, decorated with Moorish arabesques;
here a statuette that was sixth-century Greek,
subtly mingled with Benin. Here was a Black

191
ALONG  THE   ROAD

Forest peasant's table standing on-Egyptian legs;
here a crucifix that might have been carved by a
T'ang artist who happened to have spent a year
in Italy as the pupil of Bernini. Goat, woman,
lion and gryphon�here were chimaeras and
empusas at every turn. And none of them (that
was the real horror, for success justifies every-
thing) none of them were good.

Germany, it is true, is the country where the
dangers of too much learning have made them-
selves most apparent. It is the country that has
drunk most deeply of the Pierian spring. For
the last fifty years German publishers have
brought out six illustrated monographs to ev,ery
one produced in France, and a dozen at least to
every one that we have published in England.
With untiring industry and an enthusiasm which
nothing�not the War, not even the Peace�has
been able to damp, the Germans have photo-
graphed the artistic remains of every people that
has ever flourished on the face of the earth. And
they have ^published these photographs, with
learned prefaces, in little books, which they sold,
once upon a time, for a mark apiece, and which
even now do not cost more than, shall we say, fif-
teen or twenty thousand millions. The Germans
know more about the artistic styles of the past

192
" THE PIERIAN SPRING
than any other people in the world�and their
own art, to-day, is about as hopelessly dreary
as any national art could well be. Its badness
is, in mathematical terms, a function of its
iearnedness.

What has happened in Germany has happened,
though to a slightly less marked degree, in every.
country of the world. We all know too much,
and our knowledge prevents us�unless we hap-
pen to be artists of exceptional independence and
talent�from doing good work.

Up till quite recently no European artist knew>
or thought it worth while to know, anything
about any forms of art except those which had
been current in his own continent. And even
of those he knew precious little. A sixteenth-
century sculptor, for example, knew something
about Greek carving�or something, at any rate,
about Roman copies of carvings belonging to a
certain period of Greek art. But of the works
which the sculptors of the Gothic past had pro-
duced, even in his own country,.he knew very
little -y. and what he knew, he was disposed to
deride as being merely barbarous. There were
no photographs then ; there were even very few
engravings. The renaissance sculptor worked
in an almost total ignorance of what had been

N                        193
ALONG  THE  ROAD

done by other sculptors, at other periods or in
countries other than his own. The result was
that he was able to concentrate on the one con-
vention that seemed to him good�the classical�
and work away at it undisturbed, until he had
developed all its potential resources.

The case of architecture is still more remark-
able. For three hundred years the classical orders
reigned supreme in Europe. Gothic was for-
gotten and despised. Nobody knew anything of
any other styles. Generation after generation of
architects worked away uninterruptedly in terms
of this one convention. And what an astonishing
variety of achievements they were able to get out
of it ! Using the same elementary classical units,
successive- generations produced a series of absol-
utely original and dissimilar works. Brunelleschi,
Alberti, Michelangelo, Paliadio, Bernini, Pietro
da Cortona, Christopher Wren, Adam, Nash�
all these architects worked in the same classical
convention, making it yield a series of distinctive
masterpieces, each utterly unlike the other.

These were all men of genius who would have
done great things in any circumstances. What
is still more striking is the achievement of the
minor artists. During all this long period the
work of even a journeyman had qualities which

194
THE PIERIAN SPRING
we look for in vain among the lesser artists of the
present time. It was the absence of distracting
knowledge that made possible this high level of
achievement among the less talented men. There
was for them only one possible convention.
They concentrated their whole mind on getting
the best they possibly could out of it.

How different is the present state of affairs !
The artist of to-day knows3 and has been taught
to appreciate3 the artistic conventions of every
people that has ever existed. For him5 there is no
single right convention ; there are a thousand
conventions, which can all claim his respect be-
cause men have produced fine works in terms of
all of them. Gone Is the blessed ignorance^
vanished the healthy contempt for all but one
tradition. There is no tradition now? or there
are a hundred traditions�it comes to the same
thing. The artist's knowledge tends to distract
him5 to dissipate his energies. Instead of spend-
ing his whole life systematically exploiting one
convention^ he moves restlessly among all the
known styles3 undecided which to work in? bor-
rowing hints from each.

But in art there are no short cuts to successful
achievement. You cannot acquire in half an
hour the secrets of a style which it has taken the

195
ALONG  THE   ROAD

work of generations to refine to its perfection.
In half an hour, it is true, you can learn what are
the most striking superficial characteristics of the
style ; you can learn to caricature it. That is
all. Tp understand a style you must give your-
self up to it 5 you must live, so to speak. Inside it 5
you must concentrate and steadily labour.

But concentration is precisely the thing which
excessive knowledge tends to render impossible
�for all, at any rate, but the most individually
gifted, the most strong-minded of artists. They,
it is true, can be left to look after themselves.
Whatever their mental and physical environment,
they will be themselves. Knowledge has had its
most disastrous effects on the minor men, on the
rank and file. These, in another century, would
have worked away undistracted, trying to get the
best out of a single convention�trying and, what
is more, generally succeeding to the very limit
of their natural capacities. Their descendants
are trying to get the best out of fifty different
conventions at onae. With what results Munich
most hideously shows.. And not only Munich,
but Paris too, London, New York, the whole
knowledge-ridden world.

Still, the knowledge exists and is easily avail-
able There is no destroying or concealing it.
THE PIERIAN SPRING
There can be no recapture of the old ignorance
which allowed the artists of the past to go on
working in one style for years, for centuries even*
at a time. Knowledge has brought with it rest-
lessness, uncertainty and the possibility of rapid
and incessant change in the conventions of art.
How many styles have come and gone during the
last seventy years ! Pre-Raphaelitism, impres-
sionism, art nouveau, futurism., post-impression-
ism, cubism., expressionism. It would have taken
the Egyptians a hundred centuries to run through
such a fortune of styles. To-day, we invent a
new convention�or, more often, resuscitate a
combination of old conventions out of the past�
exploit it, and throw it away, all in the space of
five years. The fixity of the old traditions, the
sure refinement of taste, born of ignorance and
intolerant fastidiousness, have gone. Will they
ever return ? In time, no doubt, the artists will
have inured themselves to the poison of the
Pierian spring. The immense mass of know-
ledge which, in our minds, is still crude, will
gradually be digested. When that has happened,
some sort of fixity�or rather some slow and
steady motion, for in life there is no fixity�will
have been achieved. Meanwhile, we must be
content to live in an age of dissipated energies, of

297
ALONG  THE   ROAD

experiment and pastiche5 of restlessness and hope-
less uncertainty.

The vast increase in our knowledge of art
history has affected not only the artists themselves^
but ail those who take an Interest in the arts.
For tout $ avoir est tout pardonner � we have
learned to appreciate and see the best In every
style. To Voltaire and Dr. Johnson even Gothic
art seemed a barbarism. What would they have
said if we had asked them to admire the plastic
beauties of a Polynesian statue, or the painting of
an animal by an artist who lived millenniums
before the dawn of history ? Knowledge has
enabled us to sympathize with unfamiliar points
of views to appreciate artistic conventions devised
by people utterly unlike ourselves. All this, no
doubt5 is a very good thing. But our sympathy
is so vast and we are so much afraid of showing
ourselves intolerant towards the things we ought
to like, that we have begun to love in our all-
embracing way not merely the highest? in what-
ever convention, when we see it, but the lowest
too.

We are not content with appreciating the good
things which our ancestors condemned. Appetite
grows with what it feeds on. The good is not
enough to satisfy our hungry appreciation j we

198
THE PIERIAN SPRING
must swallow the bad as well. To justify our-
selves in this appreciation of what is bad, we have
created a whole series of new aesthetic values.
The process which began some time ago has gone
on with ever-increasing speed and thoroughness^,
till there is now almost nothing, however bad,
from which we cannot derive pleasure.

Historically, 1 suppose, the first stage in the
breaking up of the old standards of taste was the
invention of the * picturesque.' A picturesque
object may be defined as a thing which has some
quality or qualities in excess of the normal. The
nature of the excessive quality is almost a matter
of indifference. Thus, even an excess of dirti-
ness is sufficient to render an object picturesque.
The ideally picturesque object or scene possesses
several excessive qualities in violent contrast, one
with another�for example, excess of gloom con-
trasting with excess of light, excess of magnifi-
cence with excess of squalor.

The quaint may be defined as the picturesque
made smaller and touch ed with the comic. Those
little old houses which Dickens so loved to de-
scribe�all holes and corners and curious accidents
�are typical pieces of quaintness. There is
always something snug and homely about the
quaint, something even, in a comic way, slightly
199
ALONG   THE   ROAD

virtuous�funnily good, like Tom Pinch in
Martin Chuzz/ewit. It was the Victorian middle
classes who erected quaintness into a standard of
aesthetic excellence. Their love of it, coupled
with their love of the picturesque, permitted them
to admire a vast number of things which have
practically no connection with art at all. What
I may call * arty-craftiness ' or * peasantry * is a
Tolstoyan derivation from the quaint.

The great invention of more recent years has
been the * amusing.' In origin this is a highly
sophisticated, upper-class standard of value. All
bad art, whose badness is a positive and not a
merely negative quality of respectable dulness,
may be said to be amusing. For instance, Words-
worth, when he writes badly, is not at all amusing.
Moore, on the other hand, is 5 for Moore's bad-
ness is of the period, highly coloured, mannered
and mincing. The badness of Wordsworth, like
his goodness, is of all time. The Ecclesiastical
Sonnets are absolute bathos, just as the finest
passages in the Prelude and Excursion are absolute
poetry.

A highly developed sense of the amusing in art
is now extremely common. Few of those who
take any conscious interest in the arts are now
without it. Amusingness, has even come to have

200
THE  PIERIAN  SPRING
a commercial value j  dealers find that they can
get good prices for the papier mdche furniture of
the eighteen-fifties,  for  the wax flowers and
statuettes of the age of Louis-Philippe.    The
people who collect these objects appear to derive
as much satisfaction from them�for a time at any
rate�as they would from the most austerely
graceful Heppelwhite or the choicest fourteenth-
century ivories.    And there is no  reason, of
course, why they should not? provided that they
continue to recognize the fact that Heppelwhite
is better than Victorian papier mdche and that
mediaeval ivories are more beautiful than wax
flowers.    But the trouble is that this recognition
is not always so complete or so prompt as it should
be.    That is the great danger attendant on the
cult of the amusing 5 it makes its votaries forget
that there are such things as the beautiful and the
sublime.    In the end Erasmus Darwin comes to
be preferred to Wordsworth5 Longhi to Giotto.
Indirectly, it is the Pierian spring that is re-r
sponsibl�.

A NIGHT AT  PIETRAMALA

VV HAT I love best In all the world/ says
Browning in De Gustibus^ c is a castle, precipice-
encurled, in a gash of the wind-grieved Apen-
nine.? De Gustibus^ indeed, I take the hint and
shall not argue the point. Suffice it to say that,
though I like the poem, I cannot share the poet's
tastes. A castle in the Apennine would come
quite low in the list of the things I love. A
palace in Rome, a villa just outside the gates of
Siena, even a motor caravan would stand higher.
For the epithet which Browning applies to the
Apennine is only too appropriate. He himself,
no doubt, enjoyed being grieved by the wind. I
can imagine him, with bent head, tunnelling his
way through one of those hellish blasts which
come hooting down, in spring and winter, through
the gashes between the hills. He would feel
exhilarated by the effort i his struggle against the
elements would elate him and he would return to
his castle to write some more than* ordinarily
hearty paean In praise of passion and energy�
passion for passion's sake, energy admirable, not
so much for its direction as for its volume. Such,
I am sure, were the effects of the wind on Brown-
ing ; it confirmed him in his blustering optimism.

205
ALONG  THE   ROAD

In me, on the other hand, the wind of the Apen-
nines begets nothing but neuralgia and the pro-
foundest depression. It is not Pro spice that I
should write in the precipice-encurled castello ;
it is something in the style of the City of Dreadful
Night

That I am not exaggerating the horrors of the
wind among the Apennines is proved by the fact
that it has been found necessary, for the con-
venience and even the safety of travellers, to
protect the most exposed places of the principal
passes with high walls. I remember in particular
one section of the main road from Florence to
Bologna which is flanked for hundreds of yards
by an immense parapet, like the great wall of
China. The road at this point, which is between
two and three thousand feet above the sea, cuts
across the head of a deep and narrow valley,
through which there sucks a perpetual draught.
Even in summer, on halcyon days, you can hear
as you pass under the lee of the v^all, a melancholy
wailing of the winds overhead. But on rough
days in winter, in the spring and autumn, the air
is full of fearful noises, as though the gates of hell
had been opened and the lost souls were making
holiday. What happened to travellers who
passed that way before, some hundred years ago,
206
A   NIGHT  AT  PIETRAMALA
a beneficent Grand-Ducal government built the
wall, I shudder to think.    They must often have
been., quite literally, blown off the road.

We passed that way once in March. The
Italian spring, which is not so different from the
spring in other countries, was inclement that year
and icy. In Florence the sun shone fitfully be-
tween huge clouds. Snow still lay in patches on
Monte Morello. The breeze was nipping.
* Are the passes free of snow ?' we asked at the
garage where we stopped to fill our petrol tank.
Animated by that typically Italian desire to give
*an answer that will please the questioner, the
garage man assured us that the road was perfectly
clear. And he said it with such conviction that
we imagined, as northerners would naturally
imagine, that he knew. Nothing is more charm-
ing than southern courtesy, southern sympathy
and the southern desire to please. The heart is
touched by the kindly interest which the Italians
take in your affairs $ you love them for their
courteous inquisitiveness; they make you at home
Immediately, treat you at once as a human being
and do their best to please you. It is delightful.
But sometimes they are really too sympathetic by
half. For in order not to contradict you or give
you a moment's pain by disputing the accuracy

207
ALONG THE ROAD
of your ideas, they will tell you what you want
to hear rather than what It would be of real use to
you to hear. At the same time their own self-
esteem will not permit them to confess a blank
Ignorance ; so that they will rather tell you
something incorrect than tell you nothing at all.
Thus, when the garage man told us that there
was no snow on the road from Florence to
Bologna, he said so first, because he saw that we
wanted to go to Bologna and that we should have
been disappointed If it had been Impossible and,,
second, because it was pleasanter for him to say
4 No snow ' with conviction than confess (which
was the truth) that he hadn't the faintest notion-
whether there was snow or not.

We believed him and set out. The road rises
steeply from Florence, climbs to twelve or fifteen
hundred feet and then plunges down again into
that long flat-bottomed valley locked in the midst
of the hills, the Mugello. By the time we had
reached it the sun had entirely disappeared, and
the sky above us was one vast yellowish-white
snowcloud. Looking at the various castelli one
passes by the way, I found Browning's predilec-
tions more than ever incomprehensible.

Between Florence and Bologna there are two
passes : the Futa and, five or six miles further on?

208,
A NIGHT AT PIETRAMALA
the pass of Ratlcosa. It Is near the top of the
Futa that the Grand Dukes built the bulwark
against the wind. It was strengthened5 that day*,
by heaps of driven snow. Below and above5 the
slopes were deep In snow. In the midst of all
this whiteness the road wound onwards and
upwards like a muddy snake.

Under the lee of the wall we halted and took
photographs of the Italian scenery. * The air was
calm where we stood and seemed in its stillness
almost warm. But just above us, on a level with
the top of the wall, was the wind. The snow-
flakes that it carried made its speed visible. It
filled the ears with sound. I was reminded, as I
stood there, of a rather ludicrous and deplorable
version of David Copperfield^ which Beerbohm
Tree used sometimes to stage at His Majesty's.
Tree himself acted two parts�Micawber and
Peggotty j the former, I may add parenthetically,
very well indeed (for he was an admirable come-
,dian), the latter, in his more pathetic manner,
with less success. But let that pass. Dressed as
Peggotty, Tree never made an entrance without
the wind j it was in the bluff nautical part
Every time he opened the door of his ship cottage
on the sands of Yarmouth there came from the
outer darkness a noise like the witches* sabbath.

209
ALONG  THE  ROAD

It never blew less than a full gale during the whole
run of David Copperfield. Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo
�crescendo and decrescendo. In the dress-circle
ladies reached for their furs, men turned up the
collars of their coats. It was horrible. I had
hoped then that I should never hear a wind like
that outside His Majesty's. And I never did
till that icy March day when we paused' beneath
the Grand-Ducal wall on the road from Florence
to Bologna. There,, for the first time, I heard
nature rivalling Sir Herbert's art A perfect
site, I reflected, for the Castello Browning.

At Pietramala, which lies just under the pass of
the Raticosa, we stopped at the little inn for lunch.
The idlers who gathered immediately and as
though by magic round our machine�for even
at Pietrainala, even in the snow, there were
leisured car-fanciers to whom the arrival of a
ten-horse-power Citroen was an event�lost no
time in telling us that the road on the further side
of the pass was blocked with wind-driven snow.
We went in to our lunch feeling a little depressed
�a little annoyed, too, with the garage man at
Florence. The inn-keeper, however, was re-
assuring ; gangs of men, he told us, were to be
sent out as soon as the dinner hour was over from
Pietramala and the village on the other side of the

210
A NIGHT AT PIETRAMALA
pass. By four o'clock the road would be clear ;
we should be in Bologna before dark. When we
asked if the road by Firenzuola and Imola were
open5 he shook his head. For the second time
that day we believed.

The inn-keeper's motives for not telling the
truth were different from those that actuated the
man at the garage. For the latter had lied out of
misplaced politeness and pride 5 the inn-keeper
on the contrary, lied merely out of self-interest,
He wanted to make us stay the night. He was
perfectly successful At four o'clock we set out
At the top of the pass the snow lay a yard deep
across the road, and there was not a shoveller to
be seen. We returned. The inn-keeper was.
astonished : what, no shovellers ? He could
hardly believe it. But to-morrow morning the
'road would infallibly be cleared. We decided
to stay the night.

I had taken with ine on that journey the second
volume of the Encyclopaedia ~Britannica�And.-
Aus. It is a capital volume from which one can
derive much useful knowledge about Angio-
sperais, the Anglican Communion, Angling,
Anthrax, Aphasia, Apples, Arrowroot, Asia,
Aurora Borealis and Australia, not to mention

Astrology and Astronomy.    I started hopefully
on Animal Worship.    'The bear/ I learned,
* enjoys a- large measure of respect from all savage
races that come in contact with it.'    From me^
that evening, he got a large measure of envy.    I
thought of Mr. Belloc's rhyme :
The Polar Bear is unaware

Of cold that cuts me through :
For why ?    He has a coat of hair.
I wish I had one too!

For in spite of the fire, in spite of great-coats^
It was appallingly cold. ' The products of the
cow/ I read on, and was charmed by the com-
pendious euphemism, * are important in magic/
But I got no further ; it was too cold even to
read. To this day I remain ignorant of the feel-
ings of the Thlinkit Indians towards the crow5
of the Kalangs towards the dog and the Siamese
towards white elephants. And if I do happen to
know that the Hottentot god, Cagn, is incarnated
in the praying mantis, Ngo, that is due to the fact
that I took the same volume with me on another
tour during the summer, when the evenings were
less inclement and the mind was free to devote
itself to higher things than the problem of mere
self-preservation.

It was cold enough in the sitting-room ;  but

212
A NIGHT AT PIETRAMALA
the horror only really began when we went to
bed. For the bedrooms of the Inn were without
fireplaces 5 there was no possibility of heating
them. In those bedrooms one could have pre-
served mutton indefinitely. Still dressed in all
the woolly garments we possessed, we got into our
stony beds. Outside the wind continued to howl
among the hills. While the sheets were yet un-
thawedj sleep was out of the question. I lay
awake listening to the noise of the wind and
wondering what would be the effect of the hurri-
cane on those flaming jets of natural gas for which
Pietramala is renowned. Would the wind blow
out those giant will-o'-the-wisps ? Or would
they burn on in spite of it ? The thought of
flames was comforting ; I dwelt on them with
a certain complaisance.

They are not uncommon, these jets of fire,
among the northern Apennines. Salsornaggiore,
for example, owes its coat of arms, a salamander
among the flames, to its fountains of natural gas,
It is in this gaseous form alone that the hydro-
carbons of the Apennines make their appearance
at the centre of the chain. On the outer slopes
they are to be found in the more commercially
useful form of petroleum, which is now extracted
in small quantities from the foothills in the neigh-

213

bourhood of Piacenza,, Reggio and Modena.
Who knowSj we may yet live to see the towers of
Canossa rivalled by the wooden castles of the
derricks on the slopes below.

The shutters rattled, the wind howled. De-
cidedly3 no fire could burn in the teeth of such a
blast Poor ignes fatui I how welcome we
should have made them In this ice-house ! How
tenderly, like vestals5 we should have cherished
any flame3 however fatuous !

From thinking of those flames and wishing
that I had them in the room with me? I went on
to wonder why it was that the gas-fires of Pietra-
mala should be so oddly familiar to me. Had
I read about them ? Had I recently heard them
mentioned in conversation or what ? I racked
my brains. And then suddenly I remembered 5 it
was in Bence Jones's Life and Letters of Faraday
that I had read of Pietramala.

One very wet day in the autumn of 1814 two
rather queer English tourists alighted from their
chaise in this squalid little village of Pietramala.
One was approaching middle age5 the other still
a very young man. Their names were Sir
Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday, They
had been out of England almost exactly a year,
For it was in the year 1813, just before the news

214
A NIGHT AT PIETRAMALA
of the battle of Leipzig had reached Paris, that
they crossed into France. To us it seems in the'
natural order of things that science and religion
should be national affairs, that clergymen should
scream * Hurrah and Hallelujah * and chemists
cheer for the flag and H2SO4. But it was not
always so. God and the works of God were once
considered international. God was the first to
be nationalized 5 after the Reformation he once
more became frankly tribal But science and
even art were still above patriotism. During
athe eighteenth century France and Englgpd
exchanged ideas almost as freely as cannon balls.
French scientific expeditions were allowed to
pass in safety between the English fleets | Sterne
was welcomed enthusiastically by his country's
enemies. The tradition lingered on even into
the eighteen hundreds. Napoleon gave medals-
to English men of science $ and when, in 1813,
Sir Humphry Davy asked for leave to travel on
the Continent, his request was granted at once.
He was received in Paris with the highest honours,
was made a member of the Institute, and in
spite of the intolerable rudeness and arrogance
which he habitually displayed, he was treated
throughout his stay in France with the most per-
fect courtesy. In our more enlightened twentieth

215
ALONG  THE  ROAD

century he would have been shot as a spy or
interned.

Restless and erratic, Davy hurried across
Europe In search of scientific truth. All was
fish that came to his net At Genoa he made
electric experiments on the torpedo fish. At
Florence he borrowed the great burning-glass of
the Grand Dukes and, with its aid, set a diamond
on fire. At Rome he analysed the pigments
employed by the artists of antiquity. At Naples
he made experiments on Iodine and excursions up
V^uvius. With him went Michael Faraday as
* assistant In experiments and writing.' Lady
Davy, however, tried to use him as courier and
confidential servant as well. Young Faraday
found the position a little trying. It was only the
consciousness that he was being given an un-
rivalled opportunity to educate himself that de-
cided him to keep his post. Sir Humphry's
character might not be entirely estimable (in-
deed, Faraday was known to remark in later years
that 6 the greatest of all his great advantages was
that he had had, in Davy, a model to teach him
what he should avoid ') ; but he was, undoubt-
edly, a mine of scientific learning. To be with
him constantly, as Faraday was, during those
eighteen months of travel, was a liberal educa-

216
A   NIGHT  AT   PIETRAMALA
don.    Young Faraday.knew it and put up with
Lady D.

At Pietramala3 then5 they stopped in the pour-
ing rain�and doubtless in the howling wind as
well�to look at the natural fireworks. Speci-
mens of the gas were bottled and taken down to
Florence for analysis. Sir Humphry concluded5
correctly, that it was a light hydrocarburetj pure,

To this desolate little village on the crest of the
Apennines Faraday devotes a couple of pages in
his journal. To Florence, except in so far as it
was a town where there were facilities for making
experiments, he gives no space at all. Faraday
paid little attention to the works of man5 however
beautiful. It was the works of God that inter-
ested him. There is a magnificent consistency
about him. All that he writes in his journal or
letters is perfectly in character. He is always the
natural philosopher. To discover truth is his
sole aim and interest. His purpose is unalterably
fixed. He never allows himself to be distracted
�not byart? which he almost completely ignores 5
not by politics^ which in the tremendous closing
�scenes of the Napoleonic drama he mentions
casually once or twice, not at all by the delights of
casual social intercourse^ though he always found
.time for friendship�but pursues his course

217
ALONG  THE  ROAD

steadily, perseverantly, modestly, disinterestedly^
and withal triumphantly as a conquering man of
genius,

Outside science his great interest was religion.
The battle between science and dogmatic theo-''
logy, which was waged during the latter half of
the nineteenth century, created an impression,
which still survives, that there is a certain radical
incompatibility between science and religion.
History shows that, as a matter of fact, no such in-
compatibility exists. If we read the biographies
of the three most genial (in the French sense)
men of science that England has produced�Sir
Isaac Newton, Faraday and James Clerk Max-
well�we shall find that all three were profoundly
religious. Sir Isaac devoted the greater part of a
long life to the interpretation of Biblical prophecy.
Faraday was an earnest and ardent Christian of
the Sandemanian sect 'Clerk Maxwell was a
great mystic as well as a great man of science $
there are letters of his which show him to have
been of the company of Boehme and Swedenborg
(himself, by the way, a scientific man of great
distinction). There is nothing in all this that
should surprise us. * An infidel astronomer is
mad'; tempered, this piece of rhetoric is some-
thing like a truth. For it is certainly impossible

218
A NIGHT AT PIETRAMALA
to study nature at all closely without becoming
convinced of the extraordinary strangeness and
mysteriousness of the familiar world in which the
mass of human beings unquesfioningly pass their
lives. The further our knowledge extends and
the more completely we realize its implications,
the more mysterious this universe is seen to be.
A man must be crass and unimaginative indeed if
he, can study the intricacies of life, the movements
of the stars, the intimate constitution of matter
without feeling from time to time a sense of awe
and amazement. In the ranks of the professional
scientists such men undoubtedly find their place 5
there are unimaginative men in all professions,
from that of the jockey to that of the bishop.
But they are not, in general, the best at their jobs.
Without imagination, without sensitiveness it is
impossible to be a successful man of science. It
would be difficult to find any great scientific man
who had not been touched by this sense of wonder
at the strangeness of things. It betrays itself in
different ways according to the upbringing and
temperament of those who feel it In some, as
quiet and orthodox religion 5 in others, unwilling
to commit themselves definitely about the nature
of the mystery which surrounds them, as agnos-
ticism j in others again (Clerk Maxwell and
219
ALONG THE ROAD"
Swedenborg are examples) the man of science is
endowed with the peculiar mental qualities of the
mystic ; in yet other cases we find men possessing
these same mystical qualities, but unrefined and
somehow coarse (for there are good mystics and
poor mystics just as there are good and poor
artists), and then we have, not Clerk Maxwell
with his delicate and beautiful mysticism, but
Newton the interpreter of the prophetic books.
For Faraday the corollary and complement of
science was protestant Christianity. His sense
of wonder, his awe in face of the beautiful mystery
of the world, expressed itself in the terms of
Sandemanian meetings and Bible reading. He
stands in the scale of mystics somewhere about
half-way between Maxwell and Newton, not very
highly gifted but at the same time not vulgarly
gifted, a sort of Andrea del Sarto between Giotto
on the one hand and Caravaggio on the other. A
Cherubini between Mozart and Strauss.

That king who, in Anatole France's fable, was
only to be cured of his melancholy by putting on
the shirt of a happy man, would have been well
advised to apply to Faraday. A shirt of his would
have been spec! fie against the king's malady* For
if any man was happy it was surely he. All his
life long he did, professionally, the things he

220
A  NIGHT  AT  PIETRAMALA

desired to do.    To knows to discover the truth__

that was his desire. And it is a desire whose ful-
filment does not lead to disappointment and
boredom, as does the fulfilment of almost every
other human longing. For there is no end to
truth j each part of it reveals, when found,, yet
other parts to be discovered. The man who
desires knowledge knows no satiety, for the know-
able is perpetually new. He might live innumer-
able lives and never grow weary. True, the
knowable world is not everything. There is
also the world of feelings 5 there is also that
which is humanly unknowable. In our relation
to these two worlds there is plenty of scope for
unhappiness. But Faraday was also emotionally
happy. His marriage was an unquali fied success j
he had good friends $ the tenour of his life was
even and he did not desire more than what he
possessed- He was equally fortunate in his rela-
tion to the unknowable. The problems of life,
as they are called, never troubled him. The
religion in which he was brought up offered a
solution of them in advance 5 he passed through
no crisis such as that which drove Tolstoy almost
to suicide, It is interesting to note that he separ-
ated the domain of science sharply from that of
religion, the knowable from the unknowable.

221
A  NIGHT  AT   PIETRAMALA
happier than other men.    A'priori^ and almost by
definition, they ought to be.    And when one
reads their lives one finds that in point of fact they
generally were happy.    How satisfactory these
lives of born men of science always are !    There
is an integrity about these men, a unity of purpose
that to the rest of us poor distracted mortals seems
wonderfully enviable and wonderfully beautiful.
If I could be born again and choose what I
should be in my next existence, I should desire to
be a man of science�not accidentally but by
nature, inevitably a man of science.    Fate might
offer other alternatives�to have power or wealth,
be a king or a statesman.    These glittering temp-
tations I should have small difficulty in rejecting 5
for my objection to the irritating turmoil of
practical life is even stronger than my love of
money or power, and since these cannot be ob-
tained without plunging into practical life, I can
sacrifice them cheerfully.    It is easy to make a
virtue of psychological necessity. The only thing
that might make me hesitate would be an offer by
fate of artistic genius.    But even if I could be
Shakespeare, I think I should still choose to be
Faraday.    True, the posthumous glory of Shake-
speare is greater than that of Faraday 5 men still
read Macbeth but not (even if they happen to be
223
ALONG THE ROAD
electricians) � the Experimental Researches in
Electricity. The work of a man of science is a
creation on which others build'; it has implica-
tions, it grows. If we want to know about elec-
tricity, we read what the contemporary successors
and disciples of Faraday have to say about it. But
Macbeth is a thing in itself, not a discovery on
which other men can improve. There is no such
thing as progress in art Every artist begins at
the beginning. The man of science, on the
other hand, begins where his predecessor left off.
Opinions and ideas change, under the weight of
accumulated experience, from age to age. The
instinctive, emotional side of man, being heredi-
tary, remains the same. The man of science
provides the experience that changes the ideas of
the race ; in course of time his discoveries are
superseded. The artist does not go out of date
because he works with materials that do not
change. Lyrics composed by a palaeolithic poet
would still be moving. But the views of a
palaeolithic astronomer would possess, for us, a
merely historical and academic interest.

And yet in spite of all this I would still rather
be Faraday than Shakespeare. Posthumous fame
brings nobody much satisfaction this side of the
grave 5 and though the consciousness that one

224
A   NIGHT  AT  PIETRAMALA
possesses a great artistic talent must be profoundly
satisfying, though the free employment of it must
be a source of happiness, it seems to me that the
possession and employment of a scientific talent
must be still more satisfying.    For the artist5
whose function is the apt expression and the con-
veyance to others of the common human emotions.,
must fatally pass much of his life in the emotional
world of human contacts.    His reflections upon
the world, his personal reactions to contacts�
these form the subject matter of his art.    The
� world in which the man of science passes the pro-
fessional part of his life is non-human^ has nothing
to do with personal relationships and emotional
reactions.    We are all subdued to what we work
In ; and I personally would rather be subdued to
intellectual contemplation than to emotion^ would
rather use my soul professionally for knowing
than for feeling.

One of the minor disadvantages of being a
great artist is the fact that the artist enjoys a con-
siderable social prestige. Art is the subject of
snobbery to a far greater extent than science.
The presence of a well-known poet or painter is
felt to give distinction to a dinner-party. Host-
esses rarely ask one to meet bio-chemists3 how-
ever distinguished. The reason for this is simple j

p                       225
ALONG  THE  ROAD

all men and women Imagine that they can appreci-
ate the arts�and up to a point, of course, actually
can�while the number who can understand the
technicalities of science is remarkably smalL
(Vainly, alas, I wish that I myself belonged to
that minority.) To this is due the enviable
immunity of the men of science from the intrusion
of frivolous bores. The artist, on the other hand5
is one of the favourite quarries of the unemployed
rich 5 a good specimen is worth at least an am-
bassador, almost an Indian prince. If the artist
is a man of strong character he will find the atten-
tions of the lion-hunters not dangerous, indeed^
but profoundly exasperating. They are only
dangerous to those who allow themselves to be
caught. It is pleasant to be flattered 5 and if one
likes to waste time, there is no easier way of doing
so than in casual social intercourse. The artist
who succumbs to social temptations loses every-
thing : his time, his integrity, his sense of pro-
portion, the very hope of achieving anything
important. He is the more unfortunate in being
exposed to them.

Towards morning when, like a mutton chop
on a cold plate, I had a little thawed my bed, the
phantoms of Michael Faraday and Sir Humphry
Davy departed, leaving me alone with my re-

226
A  NIGHT  AT  PIETRAMALA
pressed wishes.    What they may have been, 1
don?t know.    But at any rate they fulfilled them-
selves, ideally and symbolically., in a confused
nightmare of motor cars and snowdrifts.

The wind was still blowing when I woke up.
We spent the forenoon shivering in the sitting-
room of the inn. Every few minutes the land-
lord came in with fresh news about the state of
affairs on the pass. Telephone messages had
arrived from Florence and Bologna 5 an army of
shovellers was being mobilized ; now it was on
the move ; a man who had just come down from
the pass had seen them at work 3 by two o'clock
the road could not fail to be clear. After giving
us each item of news, he bowed, smiled, rubbed
his hands and went back to his kitchen to invent
the next. He had a fertile imagination.

Fitfully, I read about the Armenian Church.
But my interest was languid. I was too cold
even to feel a proper enthusiasm over the dis-
' Co very that * the old sacrificial hymns were
probably obscene and certainly nonsensical* Re-
membering that phrase in subsequent summers, I
have been* delighted by it. How well, how
pithily it describes not merely the old sacrificial
hymns of pre-Christian Armenia, but a whole
mass of modern art and self-styled science�the

217
ALONG  THE   ROAD

greater part of psycho-analytic literature, for
example, the music of Schreker, most expression-
ist painting, Ulysses^ and so on. As for the less
6 modern' pseudo-sciences and pseudo-art, from
spiritualism to commercial fiction�these do not
even possess the saving grace of obscenity $ they
are merely nonsensical.

The morning passed ; it was time for lunch.
After a meal of spaghetti and broiled goat, we felt-
a little stronger and a little less cold. * How are
things on the pass ?' we asked. But our host
seemed suddenly to have lost his omniscience and
with it his optimism. He did not know what
was happening and he advised us to wait for a
little. By five o'clock, however, all would un-
doubtedly be well. And the road by Firenzuola ?
That was hopeless 5 he was certain of that. He
left us wondering what to do 3 whether to wait,
whether to return to Florence�what ? We
were still in a state of painful uncertainty when a
heaven-sent messenger in the form of a man with
a horse and trap stopped at the inn door. We
appealed to him. A miracle ! Not only did he
know the truth ; he also imparted his knowledge
in a plain unvarnished way. No shovellers, he
assured us, were working on the pass 5 nor would
any be sent there till the wind had changed (for

228
A   NIGHT  AT  PIETRAMALA
when the wind was blowing in this particular
direction^ the snow was carried back on to the
road as soon as it had been taken off).    The wind
might change this evening5 of course $ but on the
other hand it might only change next,.week.
But if we wanted to go to Bologna5 why hadn't
we taken the Firenzuola road ?    Yes3 why not ?
said the landlord, who had joined us and was
listening to the conversation.    Why not take the
Firenzuola road ?    He had seen that the game
was up and that there was now no further hope
of getting us to stay another night.    Why not ?
We looked at him significantly, in silence.    He
smiled back5 imperviously good-humoured, and
retired to compile his bill.

We set out. The sky was white and full of
cloudy movement. Here and there the white
mountains were scarred with black, where the
precipices were too steep to allow the snow to lie,
From La Casetta we slid down the break-neck
road that twists down into the valley of the
Santerno. Within its walls Firenzuola was
black, ancient and grim. From Firenzuola the
road follows the Santerno. The river has tun-
nelled a winding passage through the mountains.
The valley Is deep and narrow ; here and there
road and river run between perpendicular walls of

229
ALONG  THE   ROAD

rock, banded slantwise with the lines of tilted
stratification. Slowly the valley broadens out,
the mountains degenerate into bare bleak downs.
At the foot of the hills is the plain, narrowed here
between the mountains and the sea, but expanding
and expanding as one travels northwards into the
immense unbroken flatness of the Po valley.

At Imola we turned into the great Via Emilia
that runs in an undeviating straight line from
Rimini to Piacenza. What cities are strung
along that white stretched thread ! Cesena, Forli,
Faenza, Xmola, Bologna, Reggio, Modena, Parma
�bead after precious bead.

It was dark when we entered Bologna and the
streets were full of maskers. It was the last
day of carnival.

We nosed our way through the crowd, hooting.
* Maschere !' the maskers shouted as we passed 5
and in our goggles and mufflers, we too seemed
dressed for carnival It was a feeble show $ a
few young women in dominoes, a few noisy
students in fancy dress�that was all. I thought
of the brilliant shows and masquerades of the past.
Charming, no doubt j but one should not regret
them. For shows and masquerades are symptoms
of bad government. Tyrants pass all their lives
at the centre of a gorgeous ballet. An oppressed

230
A NIGHT AT PIETRAMALA
populace., too poor to pay for amusements of its
own, is kept in good humour by these royal
theatricals, which are free of charge. And in the
course of periodical Saturnalia slaves are able to
sublimate their revolutionary feelings in sportive
licence. If carnival has decayed, so too has
oppression. And where people have pence
enough to go to the cinema, there is no need for
kings and popes to stage their ballets. Still, it
was a very poor show 5 I felt they might have
celebrated our arrival in Bologna a little more
worthily.

231
WORK AND  LEISURE

^EFORMERS look forward to a time when effi-
cient social organization and perfected machinery
will do away with the necessity for severe and
prolonged labours making possible for all men and
women an amount of leisure such as is enjoyed
at the present day only by a privileged few.
Nobody, in that golden age3 will need to work
more than four or five hours a day. The rest
of every man's time will be his own, to do with
whatsoever he likes*

It is difficult for any sensitive person not to
sympathize with these aspirations. One must be
most arrogantly certain of one's own super-
manhood before one can complacently accept the
slavery on which the possibility of being a super-
man is based. Poor Nietzsche ended by signing
his letters � Nietzsche Caesar' and died in a
madhouse. Perhaps that is the price that must
be paid�at any rate by the intelligent; for the
placidly stupid never pay5 just as they never
receive^ anything�for an unfaltering conviction
of superiority.

But sympathy with an ideal need not make
the sympathizer uncritical of it; one may feel
strongly^but one must not therefore cease to think*

232
WORK AND LEISURE
The majority of human beings are oppressed by
excessive labour of the most senseless kind. That
fact may, and Indeed should, arouse our indigna-
tion and our pity. But these emotions must not
prevent us from criticizing the project of those
who wish to change the present state of things.
The social reformers desire to see a dispensation
under which all men will have as much, or nearly
as much leisure as is enjoyed by the leisured classes
to-day: We may be permitted to doubt, for all
our sympathy, whether the consummation' is
really, after all, so much to be desired.

Let us begin by asking one simple question :
What is it proposed that human beings shall do
with the leisure which social reorganization and
perfected machinery are to give them ?

Prophets of the future give fundamentally the
same answer to this question, with slight varia-
tions according to their different tastes. Henri
Poincar^, for example, imagined that the human
beings of the future would fill their long leisures
by * contemplating the laws of nature/ Mr. Ber-
nard Shaw is of much the same opinion. Having
ceased, by the time they are four years old, to take
/any interest in such childish things as love, art and
the society of their fellow beings, the Ancients in
Back to Methuselah devote their indefinitely pro-

233
ALONG  THE   ROAD

longed existences to meditating on the mysterious
and miraculous beauty of the cosmos. Mr, H. G,
Wells portrays in Men like Gods a race of athletic
chemists and mathematical physicists who go
about naked and, unlike Mr. Shaw's austerer
Ancients, make free love in a rational manner
between the experiments. They also take an in-
terest in the arts and are not above playing games.

These three answers to our question are typical.
Different prophets may differ in their estimate of
the relative importance of the various activities
which make up what is generally known as * the
higher life ' 5 but all agree that the lives of our
leisured posterity will be high. They will
eagerly make themselves acquainted with * the
best that has been thought or said' about every-
thing | they will listen to concerts of the classiest
music ; they will practise the arts and handicrafts
(at any rate until the time comes when even these
occupations seem childish) ; they will study the
sciences, philosophy, mathematics, and meditate
on the lovely mystery of the world in which
they live,

In a word, these leisured masses of a future
which there is, no reason to believe enormously
remote�indeed, our grandchildren may live to
see the establishment of the four-hour day�will

234
WORK  AND   LEISURE
do all the things which our leisured classes of the
present time so conspicuously fail to do.

How many rich and leisured people are there
now living., who spend their time contemplating
the laws of nature ? I cannot say $ all I know
is that I rarely meet them. Many of the Ieisured3
it is true? devote themselves to the patronage and
even the amateur practice of the arts. But any
one who has moved among rich * artistic * people
knows how much of this cultivation of the arts is
due to snobbery 3 how shallow and insincere their
loudly voiced enthusiasms mostly are. The
leisured classes take up art for the same reasons
as they take up bridge�to escape from boredom.
With sport and love-making, art helps to fill up
the vacuum of their existence.

At Monte Carlo and Nice one meets the rich
whose dominant interests are play and love. Two
millions, according to my guide-book3 annually
visit Monte Carlo alone. Seven-eighths of the
whole leisured population of Europe must con-
centrate themselves yearly on that strip of the
coast. Five thousand jazz bands play daily for
their delectation. A hundred thousand motor
vehicles transport them from one place to another
at great speed. Huge joint-stock companies offer
them every kind of distraction, from roulette to
ALONG  THE   ROAD

golf. Legions of prostitutes assemble from all
parts of the globe and enthusiastic amateurs of the
gentle passion abound. For four months in the
year the French Riviera is an earthly paradise.
When the four months are over, the leisured rich
return to their northerly homes, where they find
awaiting them less splendid, but quite authentic
me cur $ ales of the paradise they have left behind.

The leisured rich at Monte Carlo are those, I
have said, whose chief resources against ennui or
serious thoughts are love and play. Many of
them are also ' artistic.' But it is not, I think,
at Monte Carlo that the best specimens of the
artistic rich are to be found. To see them at
their best one must go to Florence. Florence is
the home of those who cultivate with an equal
ardour Mah-jongg and a passion for Fra Angelico.
Over tea and crumpets they talk, if they are too-
old for love themselves, of their lascivious juniors;
but they also make sketches in water colour and
read the Little Flowers of St. Francis.

I must not, in justice to the leisured rich, omit
to mention that respectable minority of them who
occupy themselves with works of charity (not to
mention tyranny), with politics, with local admin-
istration and occasionally with scholarly or scien-
tific studies. I hesitate to use the word * service *;

226
WORK AN-D LEISURE
for it has'been held up so frequently as an ideal
and by such a riff-raff of newspaper proprietors,
hard-headed business men and professional moral-
ists from the Y.M.C.A., that it has lost all real
significance. The * ideal of service ' is achieved,
according td our modern messiahs, by those who
do efficient and profitable business with just
enough honesty to keep them out of gaol. Plain
shopkeeping is thus exalted into a beautiful virtue.
The ideal of service which animates the best part
of the English leisured class has nothing to do
with the ideals of service so frequently mentioned
by advertisers in American magazines. If I had
not made this clear, my praise might have been
thought5 if not positively insulting, at least most
damnably faint.

There exists, then, an admirable minority.
But even' when the minority and its occupations
are duly taken into account, it cannot honestly be
said that the leisured classes of the present time,
or indeed of any historical period of which we
have knowledge, provide a very good advertise-
ment for leisure. The contemplation of richly
leisured life in Monte Carlo and even in artistic
Florence is by no means cheering or elevating.
. Nor are we much reassured when we consider
the occupations of the unleisured poor during

237   .
ALONG  THE  ROAD

those brief hours of repose allowed them between
their work and their sleep. Watching other
people play games, looking at cinema films, read-
ing newspapers and indifferent fiction5 listening to
radio concerts and gramophone records and going
from place to place in trains and omnibuses�
these, I suppose, are the principal occupations of
the working-man's leisure. Their cheapness is
all that distinguishes them from the diversions of
the rich. Prolong the leisure and what will
happen ? There will have to be more cinemas^
more newspapers, more bad fiction, more radios
and more cheap automobiles. If wealth and
education increase with the leisure, then there
will have to be more Russian Ballets as well as
more movies, more Tmeses as well as more Daily
Mail*) more casinos as well as more bookies and
football matches, more expensive operas as well as
more gramophone records, more Hugh Walpoles
as well as more Nat Goulds. Acting on the
same organisms the same causes may be expected
to produce the same effects. And for all ordinary
purposes, and so far as historical time is concerned,
human nature1 is practically unchanging $ the
organism does remain the same. Argal^ as
Launcelot Gobbo would have said. . . .

This being so, we must further assume that

238
WORK AND LEISURE
Increase of leisure wilf be accompanied by a cor-
respondingly increased incidence of those spiritual
maladies�ennui, restlessness, spleen and general
world-weariness�which afflict and have always
afflicted the leisured classes now and in the past
Another result of increased leisure, provided
that it is accompanied by a tolerably high standard
of living, will be a very much increased interest on
the part of what is now the working class in all
matters of an amorous nature. Love, in all its
complicated luxuriance, can only flourish in a
society composed of well-fed, unemployed people.
Examine the literature which has been written by
and for members of the leisured classes and com-
pare it with popular working-class literature.
Compare La Princesse de Cleves with The Pilgrim*$
Progress^ Proust with Charles Garvice, Chaucer's
Troilus and Cressida with the ballads. It be-
comes at once sufficiently evident that the leisured
classes do take and have always taken a much
keener and, I might say, more professional in-
terest in love than the workers. A man cannot
work hard and at the same time conduct elaborate
love affairs. Making love, at any rate in the
style in which unemployed women desire it to be
made, is a whole-time job. It demands both
energy and leisure. Now energy and leisure are

239
ALONG  THE  ROAD

precisely the things which a hard worker lacks.
Reduce his working hours and he will have both.

If5 to-morrow or a couple of generations hence,
it were made possible for all human beings to lead
the life of leisure which is now led only by a few,
the results, so far as I can see, would be as follows:
There would be an enormous increase in the
demand for such time-killers and substitutes for
thought as newspapers, films, fiction, cheap means
of communication and wireless telephones 5 to
put it in more general terms, there would be an
increase in the demand for sport and art. The
interest in the fine art of love-making would be
widely extended. And enormous numbers of
people, hitherto immune from these mental and
moral diseases, would be afflicted by ennui^ de-
pression and universal dissatisfaction.

The fact is that, brought up as they are at
present, the majority of human beings can hardly
fail to devote their leisure to occupations which,
if not positively vicious, are at least stupid, futile
and, what is worse, secretly realized to be futile.

To Tolstoy the whole idea of universal leisure
seemed absurd and even wicked. The social
reformers who held up the attainment of universal
leisure as an ideal he regarded as madmen. They
aspired to make all men like those rich, idle, urban

240
WORK AND  LEISURE
people among whom he had passed his youth and
whom he so profoundly despised.    He regarded
them as conspirators against the welfare of the
race.

What seemed to Tolstoy important was not
that the workers should get more leisure but that
the leisured should work. For him the social
ideal was labour for all in natural surroundings.
He wanted to see all men and women living on
the land and subsisting on the produce of the fields
that they themselves had tilled. The makers of
Utopias are fond of prophesying that a time will
come when men will altogether abandon agri-
culture and live on synthetic foods j to Tolstoy
the idea was utterly revolting. But though he
was doubtless right to be revolted, the prophets of
synthetic food are probably better seers than he.
Mankind is more likely to become urbanized
than completely ruralized. But these probabili-
ties do not concern us here. What concerns us
is Tolstoy's opinion of leisure.

Tolstoy's dislike of leisure was due to his own
experience as an idle youth and his observation of
other rich and leisured men and women. He
concluded that, as things are5 leisure Is generally
more of a curse than a blessing. It is difficult^
when one visits Monte Carlo or the other earthly

Q
ALONG THE ROAD
paradises of the leisured, not to agree with him.
Most minds will only do work under compulsion.
Leisure is only profitable to those who desire,
even without compulsion, to do mental work.
In a society entirely composed of such active
minds leisure would be an unmixed blessing.
Such a society has never existed and does not at
the present exist. Can it ever be called into
being ?

Those who believe that all the defects of nature
may be remedied by suitable nurture will reply
in the affirmative. And indeed it is sufficiently
obvious that the science of education is still in
a very rudimentary condition. We possess a
sufficient knowledge of physiology to be able to
devise gymnastic exercises that shall develop the
body to its highest attainable efficiency. But our
knowledge of the mind, and particularly of the
growing mind, is far less complete 5 and even
such knowledge as we possess is not systematically
or universally applied to the problems of educa-
tion. Our minds are like the flabby bodies of
sedentary city dwellers�inefficient and imper-
fectly developed. With a vast number of people
intellectual* development ceases almost in child-
hood j they go through life with the intellectual
capacities of boys or girls of fifteen. A proper

242
WORK  AND  LEISURE
course of mental gymnastics, based on real psycho-
logical knowledge, would at least permit all minds
to reach their maximum development.    Splendid
prospect !    But our enthusiasm for education is
a little cooled when we consider what is the maxi-
mum  development  attainable  by  the greatest
number  of human  beings.    Men born  with
talents are to men born without them as human
beings to dogs in respect to these particular facul-
ties.    Mathematically, I am a dog compared
with Newton ; a dog, musically, compared with
Beethoven, and a dog, artistically, compared with
Giotto.    Not to mention the fact that 1 am a dog
compared to Blondin, as a tight-rope walker 5 a
billiard-playing dog compared with Newman 3 a
boxing dog compared with Dempsey 5  a wine-
tasting dog compared with Ruskin's father.    And
so on.    Even if I were perfectly educated in
mathematics, music, painting, tight-rope walking,
billiard playing, boxing and wine-tasting, I should
only bacome a trained dog instead of a dog in the
state of nature.    The prospect fills me with only
moderate satisfaction.

Education can assure to every man the maximum

of mental development.    But is that maximum

�   high enough in the majority of cases to allow a

whole society to live in leisure without developing

Q*
ALONG   THE   ROAD

those deplorable qualities which have always char-
acterized the leisured classes ? I know plenty of
people who have received the best education avail-
able In the present age and employ their leisure as
though they had never been educated at all. But
then our best education is admittedly bad (though
good enough for all the men of talent and genius
whom we possess) ; perhaps when it has been
made really efficient, these people will spend their
leisure contemplating the laws of nature. Per-
haps. I venture to doubt It.

Mr. Wells, who Is a believer In nurture5 puts
his Utopia three thousand years Into the future ^
Mr. Shaw3 less optimistically trusting to nature
and a process of conscious evolution, removes his
to the year 30^000 A.D. Geologically speaking^
these times are to all Intent equal In their brevity.
Unfortunately, however, we are not fossils, but
men. Even three thousand years seem. In our
eyes, an uncommonly long time. The thought
that, three thousand or thirty thousand years
hence, human beings may, conceivably, be leading
a lovely and rational existence is only mildly com-
forting and feebly sustaining. Men have a habit
of thinking only of themselves, their children and
their children's children. And they are quite
right. Thirty thousand years hence, all may be

244
WORK AND  LEISURE
well.    But meanwhile that bad geological quarter
of an hour which separates the present from that
rosy future has got to be lived through.    And 1
foresee that one of the minor, or even the major
problems of that quarter of an hour will be the
problem of leisure.    By the year two thousand
the six-hour day will be everywhere the rule5and
the next hundred years will probably see the
maximum reduced to five or even less.    Nature,
by then, will have had no time to change the
mental habits of the race 5 and nurture, though
improved, will only turn dogs into trained dogs.
How will men and women fill their ever-expand-
ing leisure ?    By contemplating the laws of
nature, like Henri Poincare ? Or by reading the
News of the World I    I wonder.

POPULAR MUSIC

1L HERE is a certain jovial, bouncing, faoppety
little tune with which any one who has spent even
a few weeks in Germany, or has been tended in
childhood by a German nurse, must be very
familiar. Its name is 4 Ach, du lieber Augustin.'
It is a merry little affair in three-four time 5 In
rhythm and melody so simple, that the village
idiot could sing it after a first hearing $ in senti-
ment so innocent that the heart of the most sus-
ceptible maiden would not quicken by a beat a
minute at the sound of it. Rum ti-tiddle, Um
turn turn, Um turn turn, Um turn turn : Rum
ti-tiddle, Um turn turn, Um turn turn, TUM.
By the very frankness of its cheerful imbecility
the thing disarms all criticism.

Now for a piece of history. & Ach, du lieber
Augustin5 was composed in 17705 and it was the
first waltz. The first waltz ! I must ask the
reader to hum the tune to himself, then to think
jof any modern waltz with which he may be
familiar. He will find in the difference between
the tunes a subject richly suggestive of interesting
meditations.

The difference between 4 Ach, du lieber
Augustin ' and any waltz tune composed at any

246
POPULAR MUSIC

date from the middle of the nineteenth century
onwards, is the difference between one piece
of music almost completely empty of emotional
content and another5 densely saturated with
amorous sentiment, languor and voluptuousness.
The susceptible maiden who5 when she hears
6 AcL, du lieber Augustin,' feels no emotions
( beyond a general sense of high spirits and cheer-
fulness, is fairly made to palpitate by the luscious
strains of the modern waltz. Her soul is carried
swooning along, over waves of syrup; she seems to
breathe an atmosphere heavy with ambergris and
musk. From the j oily little thing it was at its birth,
the waltz has grown into the voluptuous3 heart-
stirring affair with which we are now familiar.

And what has happened to the waltz has hap-
pened to all popular music It was once Innocent
but is now provocative ; once pellucid5 now
richly clotted ; once elegant, now deliberately
barbarous. Compare the music of The Beggar's
Opera with the music of a contemporary revue,
They differ as life in the garden of Eden differed
from life in the artistic quarter of Gomorrah. The
one is prelapsarian in its airy sweetness, the other
is rich5 luscious and loud with conscious savagery.

The evolution of popular music has run parallel
on a lower plane, with the evolution of serious

247
ALONG  THE  ROAD

music. The writers of popular tunes arc not
musicians enough to be able to invent new forms
of expression. All they do is to adapt the dis-
coveries of original geniuses to the vulgar taste.
Ultimately and indirectly, Beethoven is respons-
ible for all the languishing waltz tunes, all the
savage jazzingSj for all that is maudlin and violent
in our popular music. He is responsible because
it was he who first devised really effective musical
methods for the direct expression of emotion.
Beethoven's emotions happened to be noble 5
moreover3 he was too intellectual a musician to
neglect the formal, architectural side of music.
But unhappily he made it possible for composers
of inferior mind and character to express in music
their less exalted passions and vulgarer emotions.
He made possible the weakest sentimentalities of
Schumann, the baroque grandiosities of Wagner,
the hysterics of Scriabine 5 he made possible the
waltzes of all the Strausses, from the Blue
Danube to the waltz from Salome. And he made
possible, at a still further remove, such master-
pieces of popular art as * You made me love you '
and * That coal black mammy of mine.'

For the introduction of a certain vibrant sexual
quality into music, Beethoven is perhaps less
directly responsible than the nineteenth-century

248
POPULAR  MUSIC

Italians.    I used often to wonder why it was that
Mozart's operas were less popular than those of
VerdI5 Leoncavallo and Puccini.    You'couldn't
ask for more5 or more infectiously 6 catchy * tunes
than are to be found in Figaro or Don Giovanni,
The music though * classical/ is not obscure, nor
forbiddingly complex.    On the contrary It Is
clear, simple with that seemingly easy simplicity
which only consummate genius can achieve and
thoroughly engaging.    And yet for every time
Don Giovanni is played. La Bohems Is played a
hundred.    To sea is at least fifty times as popular
as Figaro.    And If you look through a catalogue
of gramophone records you will find that, while
you can buy Rigoletto complete in thirty discs,
there are not more than three records of The?,
Magic Flute.    This seems at first sight extremely
puzzling.    But the reason is not really far to seek.
Since Mozart's day composers have learned the
art of making music throatily and palpitatingly
sexual    The arias of Mozart have a beautiful
clear purity which renders them utterly insipid
compared with the sobbing, catch-in-the-throaty
melodies   of  the   nineteenth-century   Italians.
The public, having accustomed itself to this
stronger and more turbid brewage, finds no
flavour in the crystal songs of Mozart

249
ALONG THE ROAD
No essay on modern popular music would be
complete without some grateful reference to
Rossini, who was, so far as I know, the first com-
poser to show what charms there are In vulgar
melody. Melodies before Rossini's day were
often exceedingly commonplace and cheap ; but
almost never do they possess that almost indefin-
able quality of low vulgarity which adorns some
of the most successful of Rossini's airs, and which
we recognize as being somehow a modern, con-<
temporary quality. The methods which Rossini
employed for the achievement of his melodic
vulgarity are not easy to analyse. His great
secret, I fancy, was the very short and easily
memorable phrase frequently repeated In different
parts of the scale. But It is easiest to define by
example. Think of Moses* first Aria In Moses
in Egypt. That is an essentially vulgar melody 5
and It Is quite unlike the popular melodies of an
earlier date. Its affinities are with the modern
popular tune. It is to his Invention of vulgar
tunes that Rossini owed his enormous contem-
porary success. Vulgar people before his day
had to be content with Mozart's delicate airs*
Rossini came and revealed to them a more con-
genial music. That the world fell down and
gratefully worshipped him is not surprising. If

250
POPULAR  MUSIC

he has long ceased to be popular, that Is because
his successors, profiting by his lessons, have
achieved in his own vulgar line triumphs of which
he could not have dreamed.

Barbarism has entered popular music from two
sources�from the music of barbarous people, like
the negroes, and from serious music which has
drawn upon barbarism for its inspiration. The
technique of being barbarous effectively has corne^
of course, from serious music. In the elabora-
tion of this technique no musicians have done
more than the Russians. If Rimsky-Korsakoff
> had never lived, modern dance music would not
be the thing it is.

Whether, having grown inured to such violent
and purely physiological stimuli as the clashing
and drumming, the rhythmic throbbing and wail-
ing glissandos of modern jazz music can supply,
the world will ever revert to something less
crudely direct, is a matter about which one cannot
prophesy. Even serious musicians seem to find
it hard to dispense with barbarism. In spite of
the monotony and the appalling lack of subtlety
which characterize the process, they persist in
banging away in the old Russian manner, as
though there were nothing more interesting or
exciting to be thought of. When, as a boy, I
251
ALONG THE ROAD
first heard Russian music^ I was carried off my
feet by its wild melodies^ its persist en t3 its relent-
lessly throbbing rhythms. But my excitement
grew less and less with every hearing. To-day
no music seems to me more tedious. The only
music a civilized man can take unfailing pleasure
in is civilized music. If you were compelled to
listen every day of your life to a single piece of
musicj would you choose Stravinsky's * Oiseau de
Feu' or Beethoven's 4Grosse Fugue' ? Obviously5
you would choose the fugue, if only for its in-
tricacy and because there is more in it to occupy
the mind than in the Russian's too simple
rhythms. Composers seem to forget that we are^
in spite of everything and though appearances may
be against uss tolerably civilized. They over-
whelm us not merely with Russian and negroid
noises^ but with Celtic caterwaulings on the black
notes5 with dismal Spanish wailings3 punctuated
by the rattle of the castanets and the clashing har-
monies of the guitar. When serious composers
have gone back to civilized music�and already
some of them are turning from barbarism�we
shall probably hear a corresponding change for
the more refined in popular music. But until
serious musicians lead the way, it will be absurd to
expect the vulgarizers to change their style.

252
THE MYSTERY OF THE
THEATRE

in the course of an ill-spent life, it was
my fate to go to the theatre some two hundred and
fifty times in one year. On business, 1 need not
add j one would hardly do that sort of thing for
pleasure. I was paid to go.

By the end of the year � and, for that matter,
long before our planet had completed its orbit
round the sun � I had come to the conclusion
that I was not paid enough 5 that, indeed, I could
never be paid enough for this particular job. I
gave it up 5 and nothing would n6w induce me
to resume it.

Since then, my attendances at the theatre have
averaged perhaps three per annum.

And yet there are people who go to every first
night, not because they have to, not because the
gripingbelly must be filled, but because they like It
They are not paid to go 5 they pay, as though for
a privilege. The ways of men are indeed strange.

Concerning this mystery, I used often to spec-
ulate � abstracting myself as completely as I could
from the environing horrors � during the most
excruciating passages of the plays which I had to
attend. Sitting all round me in the stalls � it was
ALONG  THE   ROAD

thus I used to reflect�are several hundred pros-
perous and, as education goes, well-educated
people,, who have paid money to see this drivelling
play (for I am assuming that the play is one of
the nineteen drivelling ones and not the rare
twentieth Heartbreak House or At Mrs. Beam's}.
They are the sort of people who, in the privacy of
their homes, would read the better class of novels^
or at any rate not the worst. They would be
indignant if you offered them a penny novelette.

And yet these readers of respectable fiction will
go to the theatre (under no compulsion, be it re-
membered) to see plays which, as literature, are
precisely on a level with the penny novelettes they
scorn,, very rightly and naturally, to read.

In their novels they demand a certain mini-
mum of probability, truth to life, credible char-
acterization and decent writing. An impossible
story, in which the personages are so many dolls5
moving in obedience to the laws of an absurd and
outworn convention and expressing themselves In
a grotesque, tumid and ungrammatical English�
this would disgust them. But to a play answer-
ing precisely to this description, they will flock in
their thousands. They will be moved to tears
and enthusiasm by situations which, in a novel?
they would find merely ludicrous. They will let

254
THE  MYSTERY  OF  THE  THEATRE
pass, and even fervidly admire, language which
any one with the slightest feeling for the use of
words would shudder to see in print.

It was over this strange anomaly that I used to
ponder during those hideous evenings at the
theatre. Why does the penny novelette disgust,
in book form, those who delight in it when ex-
hibited on the stage ? Put succinctly, that was
the not uninteresting problem.
� Mr. Bernard Shaw has said that It is easier to
write a novel than a play j and to show with what
horrible facility a novelist can spin out into pages
of thin description what the dramatist must com-
press into a few lines of dialogue, he re-wrote in
modern narrative form a scene from Macbeth.
Admittedly, Shakespeare stood the comparison
very well. For it is certainly easier to write a
bad novel than a good play. But on the other
hand, it Is much easier to write a bad play that
will be successful�even with a quite intelligent
and discriminating audience�than a bad novel
that will take in readers of the same class. A
dramatist can * get away with * a play In which
there is no characterization subtler than cari-
cature, no beauty of language less coarse than
ranting rhetoric, no resemblance to life�only an
effective situation. The novelist cannot

255
ALONG THE ROAD
This fact was recently impressed upon me (yet
once more) when I went to the theatre in Parma
�not, alas., the great Estensian theatre, but a
gimcrack little modern playhouse�to see the
Italian version of one of Sir Arthur Pinero's plays
�His House in Order it is called, if 1 remember
rightly, in English. I confess that I thoroughly
enjoyed the performance. English Higlif^ as
seen through the eyes of an Italian touring com-
pany was worth corning far�all the way from
England�to study. And the comedians were
admirable. But I marvelled, as I listened, that a
piece so entirely empty�for at Parma the un-
conscious humour and the good acting were
merely accidental additions to the blank original
�could have been, could still be, such a success,
And as a hard-working novelist, I envied the
lucky playwrights who can turn out a popular
and even highly esteemed piece, in which the
personages are either wooden puppets or cari-
catures, the language rant, and the plot a succes-
sion of those cheap epigrams of circumstance
known a$ 'situations.* If I were allowed to
make a novel out of only these ingredients3 I
should congratulate myself on having got off
uncommonly cheaply.
What makes it possible for the dramatist to put

256
THE  MYSTERY  OF  THE  THEATRE
so little into his plays, and yet successfully * get
away with it,' is, of course, the intervention of
living interpreters.    If he knows the trick�and
one learns by practice�the dramatist can pass on
to the actor the greater part of his responsibilities.
All that he need do, if he is lazy, is to invent
effective situations and leave the actors to make
the most of them.    Characterization, truth to
life, ideas, decent writing and all the rest, he can
resign to the writers for print5 secure in the know-
ledge that the public will be too much taken up
with the antics of the players to remark the ab-
sence of these merely literary trifles.

For it is the players, of course, who reconcile
an otherwise relatively discriminating public to
the sad stuff which finds its way on to the stage.
It is for the sake of the comedians that occupants
of the stalls who mighty if they were sitting by
their own firesides, be reading, shall we say. Wells *
or Conrad, or D. H. Lawrence, or even Dos-
toievsky, are content to put up with the dramatic
equivalent of the penny novelette and the picture-
paper serial story ; for the sake of the living,
smiling comedians 5 for the personal touch, the
palpitating human note.

If acting were always first class, I could under-
stand people becoming hardened first-nighters�
ALONG THE ROAD '
or shouldn't one rather say 6 softened ' ? for the
contemporary theatre is more relaxing than tonic,
more emollient than astringent�becoming, then,
softened first-nighters. A fine piece of acting is
as well worth looking at as a fine performance in
any other branch of art.

But good actors are as rare as good painters or
good writers. Not more than two or three of the
very best appear in every generation. I have
seen a few. Old Guitry5 for example. And
Marie Lloyd, the marvellous, rich, Shakespear-
ean Marie, now dead�alas, too soon 5 car elle
etait du monde ou les plus belles choses ont le pire
destin. And Little Tich. And Raquel Meller,
marvellous both as diseuse and cinema actress, the
most refined, the most nobly aristocratic inter-
preter of passion I have ever seen 5 une dme bien
nee if ever there was one. And Charlie Chaplin.
All men and women of genius.

Such perfect performances as theirs are of
course worth watching. And there are plenty
of smaller talents, not to be despised. I am as
willing to pay money to see these comedians
interpreting nonsense as to pay to see a good play
badly acted (and it is extraordinary how actor-
proof a really good play can be). But why any
one should pay to see a poor, or even very com-

258
THE MYSTERY OF THE THEATRE
petent but uninspired piece of acting in conjunc-
tion with a bad play�that is completely beyond
my powers to understand.

Hardened�I beg your pardon�softened first-
nighters to whom I have put this riddle have
never been able to give me very satisfactory
answers. Your true first-nighter., I can only
presume. Is born with a passion for the theatre;
he loves it always5 for its own sake, blindly (for
love is blind), uncritically* He pays his money
at the box office, he leaves his judgment in the
cloak-room along with his great-coat, hat and
walking-stick) and takes his seat5 certain that he
will enjoy himself, whatever may happen on the
stage, The stuffiness and the crowd, the dark,
expectant hush and then the apocalyptic rising of
the curtain, the glitter and the shining, painted
unreality�these are enough in themselves to
make him happy. He does not ask for more. I
envy him his easily contented mind*
