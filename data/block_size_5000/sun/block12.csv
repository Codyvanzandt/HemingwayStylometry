the
sort
of
thing
he
knew
all
about
He
had
come
out
of
retirement
to
compete
with
Marcial
knowing
it
was
a
competition
gained
in
advance
He
had
expected
to
compete
with
Marcial
and
the
other
stars
of
the
decadence
of
bull-fighting
and
he
knew
that
the
sincerity
of
his
own
bull-fighting
would
be
so
set
off
by
the
false
Ã¦sthetics
of
the
bull-fighters
of
the
decadent
period
that
he
would
only
have
to
be
in
the
ring
His
return
from
retirement
had
been
spoiled
by
Romero
Romero
did
always
smoothly
calmly
and
beautifully
what
he
Belmonte
could
only
bring
himself
to
do
now
sometimes
The
crowd
felt
it
even
the
people
from
Biarritz
even
the
American
ambassador
saw
it
finally
It
was
a
competition
that
Belmonte
would
not
enter
because
it
would
lead
only
to
a
bad
horn
wound
or
death
Belmonte
was
no
longer
well
enough
He
no
longer
had
his
greatest
moments
in
the
bull-ring
He
was
not
sure
that
there
were
any
great
moments
Things
were
not
the
same
and
now
life
only
came
in
flashes
He
had
flashes
of
the
old
greatness
with
his
bulls
but
they
were
not
of
value
because
he
had
discounted
them
in
advance
when
he
had
picked
the
bulls
out
for
their
safety
getting
out
of
a
motor
and
leaning
on
a
fence
looking
over
at
the
herd
on
the
ranch
of
his
friend
the
bull-breeder
So
he
had
two
small
manageable
bulls
without
much
horns
and
when
he
felt
the
greatness
again
coming
just
a
little
of
it
through
the
pain
that
was
always
with
him
it
had
been
discounted
and
sold
in
advance
and
it
did
not
give
him
a
good
feeling
It
was
the
greatness
but
it
did
not
make
bull-fighting
wonderful
to
him
any
more
Pedro
Romero
had
the
greatness
He
loved
bull-fighting
and
I
think
he
loved
the
bulls
and
I
think
he
loved
Brett
Everything
of
which
he
could
control
the
locality
he
did
in
front
of
her
all
that
afternoon
Never
once
did
he
look
up
He
made
it
stronger
that
way
and
did
it
for
himself
too
as
well
as
for
her
Because
he
did
not
look
up
to
ask
if
it
pleased
he
did
it
all
for
himself
inside
and
it
strengthened
him
and
yet
he
did
it
for
her
too
But
he
did
not
do
it
for
her
at
any
loss
to
himself
He
gained
by
it
all
through
the
afternoon
His
first
quite
was
directly
below
us
The
three
matadors
take
the
bull
in
turn
after
each
charge
he
makes
at
a
picador
Belmonte
was
the
first
Marcial
was
the
second
Then
came
Romero
The
three
of
them
were
standing
at
the
left
of
the
horse
The
picador
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
the
shaft
of
his
pic
angling
sharply
toward
the
bull
kicked
in
the
spurs
and
held
them
and
with
the
reins
in
his
left
hand
walked
the
horse
forward
toward
the
bull
The
bull
was
watching
Seemingly
he
watched
the
white
horse
but
really
he
watched
the
triangular
steel
point
of
the
pic
Romero
watching
saw
the
bull
start
to
turn
his
head
He
did
not
want
to
charge
Romero
flicked
his
cape
so
the
color
caught
the
bull
's
eye
The
bull
charged
with
the
reflex
charged
and
found
not
the
flash
of
color
but
a
white
horse
and
a
man
leaned
far
over
the
horse
shot
the
steel
point
of
the
long
hickory
shaft
into
the
hump
of
muscle
on
the
bull
's
shoulder
and
pulled
his
horse
sideways
as
he
pivoted
on
the
pic
making
a
wound
enforcing
the
iron
into
the
bull
's
shoulder
making
him
bleed
for
Belmonte
The
bull
did
not
insist
under
the
iron
He
did
not
really
want
to
get
at
the
horse
He
turned
and
the
group
broke
apart
and
Romero
was
taking
him
out
with
his
cape
He
took
him
out
softly
and
smoothly
and
then
stopped
and
standing
squarely
in
front
of
the
bull
offered
him
the
cape
The
bull
's
tail
went
up
and
he
charged
and
Romero
moved
his
arms
ahead
of
the
bull
wheeling
his
feet
firmed
The
dampened
mud-weighted
cape
swung
open
and
full
as
a
sail
fills
and
Romero
pivoted
with
it
just
ahead
of
the
bull
At
the
end
of
the
pass
they
were
facing
each
other
again
Romero
smiled
The
bull
wanted
it
again
and
Romero
's
cape
filled
again
this
time
on
the
other
side
Each
time
he
let
the
bull
pass
so
close
that
the
man
and
the
bull
and
the
cape
that
filled
and
pivoted
ahead
of
the
bull
were
all
one
sharply
etched
mass
It
was
all
so
slow
and
so
controlled
It
was
as
though
he
were
rocking
the
bull
to
sleep
He
made
four
veronicas
like
that
and
finished
with
a
half-veronica
that
turned
his
back
on
the
bull
and
came
away
toward
the
applause
his
hand
on
his
hip
his
cape
on
his
arm
and
the
bull
watching
his
back
going
away
In
his
own
bulls
he
was
perfect
His
first
bull
did
not
see
well
After
the
first
two
passes
with
the
cape
Romero
knew
exactly
how
bad
the
vision
was
impaired
He
worked
accordingly
It
was
not
brilliant
bull-fighting
It
was
only
perfect
bull-fighting
The
crowd
wanted
the
bull
changed
They
made
a
great
row
Nothing
very
fine
could
happen
with
a
bull
that
could
not
see
the
lures
but
the
President
would
not
order
him
replaced
Why
do
n't
they
change
him
Brett
asked
They
've
paid
for
him
They
do
n't
want
to
lose
their
money
It
's
hardly
fair
to
Romero
Watch
how
he
handles
a
bull
that
ca
n't
see
the
color
It
's
the
sort
of
thing
I
do
n't
like
to
see
It
was
not
nice
to
watch
if
you
cared
anything
about
the
person
who
was
doing
it
With
the
bull
who
could
not
see
the
colors
of
the
capes
or
the
scarlet
flannel
of
the
muleta
Romero
had
to
make
the
bull
consent
with
his
body
He
had
to
get
so
close
that
the
bull
saw
his
body
and
would
start
for
it
and
then
shift
the
bull
's
charge
to
the
flannel
and
finish
out
the
pass
in
the
classic
manner
The
Biarritz
crowd
did
not
like
it
They
thought
Romero
was
afraid
and
that
was
why
he
gave
that
little
sidestep
each
time
as
he
transferred
the
bull
's
charge
from
his
own
body
to
the
flannel
They
preferred
Belmonte
's
imitation
of
himself
or
Marcial
's
imitation
of
Belmonte
There
were
three
of
them
in
the
row
behind
us
What
's
he
afraid
of
the
bull
for
The
bull
's
so
dumb
he
only
goes
after
the
cloth
He
's
just
a
young
bull-fighter
He
has
n't
learned
it
yet
But
I
thought
he
was
fine
with
the
cape
before
Probably
he
's
nervous
now
Out
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
all
alone
Romero
was
going
on
with
the
same
thing
getting
so
close
that
the
bull
could
see
him
plainly
offering
the
body
offering
it
again
a
little
closer
the
bull
watching
dully
then
so
close
that
the
bull
thought
he
had
him
offering
again
and
finally
drawing
the
charge
and
then
just
before
the
horns
came
giving
the
bull
the
red
cloth
to
follow
with
at
little
almost
imperceptible
jerk
that
so
offended
the
critical
judgment
of
the
Biarritz
bull-fight
experts
He
's
going
to
kill
now
I
said
to
Brett
The
bull
's
still
strong
He
would
n't
wear
himself
out
Out
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
Romero
profiled
in
front
of
the
bull
drew
the
sword
out
from
the
folds
of
the
muleta
rose
on
his
toes
and
sighted
along
the
blade
The
bull
charged
as
Romero
charged
Romero
's
left
hand
dropped
the
muleta
over
the
bull
's
muzzle
to
blind
him
his
left
shoulder
went
forward
between
the
horns
as
the
sword
went
in
and
for
just
an
instant
he
and
the
bull
were
one
Romero
way
out
over
the
bull
the
right
arm
extended
high
up
to
where
the
hilt
of
the
sword
had
gone
in
between
the
bull
's
shoulders
Then
the
figure
was
broken
There
was
a
little
jolt
as
Romero
came
clear
and
then
he
was
standing
one
hand
up
facing
the
bull
his
shirt
ripped
out
from
under
his
sleeve
the
white
blowing
in
the
wind
and
the
bull
the
red
sword
hilt
tight
between
his
shoulders
his
head
going
down
and
his
legs
settling
There
he
goes
Bill
said
Romero
was
close
enough
so
the
bull
could
see
him
His
hand
still
up
he
spoke
to
the
bull
The
bull
gathered
himself
then
his
head
went
forward
and
he
went
over
slowly
then
all
over
suddenly
four
feet
in
the
air
They
handed
the
sword
to
Romero
and
carrying
it
blade
down
the
muleta
in
his
other
hand
he
walked
over
to
in
front
of
the
President
's
box
bowed
straightened
and
came
over
to
the
barrera
and
handed
over
the
sword
and
muleta
Bad
one
said
the
sword-handler
He
made
me
sweat
said
Romero
He
wiped
off
his
face
The
sword-handler
handed
him
the
water-jug
Romero
wiped
his
lips
It
hurt
him
to
drink
out
of
the
jug
He
did
not
look
up
at
us
Marcial
had
a
big
day
They
were
still
applauding
him
when
Romero
's
last
bull
came
in
It
was
the
bull
that
had
sprinted
out
and
killed
the
man
in
the
morning
running
During
Romero
's
first
bull
his
hurt
face
had
been
very
noticeable
Everything
he
did
showed
it
All
the
concentration
of
the
awkwardly
delicate
working
with
the
bull
that
could
not
see
well
brought
it
out
The
fight
with
Cohn
had
not
touched
his
spirit
but
his
face
had
been
smashed
and
his
body
hurt
He
was
wiping
all
that
out
now
Each
thing
that
he
did
with
this
bull
wiped
that
out
a
little
cleaner
It
was
a
good
bull
a
big
bull
and
with
horns
and
it
turned
and
recharged
easily
and
surely
He
was
what
Romero
wanted
in
bulls
When
he
had
finished
his
work
with
the
muleta
and
was
ready
to
kill
the
crowd
made
him
go
on
They
did
not
want
the
bull
killed
yet
they
did
not
want
it
to
be
over
Romero
went
on
It
was
like
a
course
in
bull-fighting
All
the
passes
he
linked
up
all
completed
all
slow
templed
and
smooth
There
were
no
tricks
and
no
mystifications
There
was
no
brusqueness
And
each
pass
as
it
reached
the
summit
gave
you
a
sudden
ache
inside
The
crowd
did
not
want
it
ever
to
be
finished
The
bull
was
squared
on
all
four
feet
to
be
killed
and
Romero
killed
directly
below
us
He
killed
not
as
he
had
been
forced
to
by
the
last
bull
but
as
he
wanted
to
He
profiled
directly
in
front
of
the
bull
drew
the
sword
out
of
the
folds
of
the
muleta
and
sighted
along
the
blade
The
bull
watched
him
Romero
spoke
to
the
bull
and
tapped
one
of
his
feet
The
bull
charged
and
Romero
waited
for
the
charge
the
muleta
held
low
sighting
along
the
blade
his
feet
firm
Then
without
taking
a
step
forward
he
became
one
with
the
bull
the
sword
was
in
high
between
the
shoulders
the
bull
had
followed
the
low-swung
flannel
that
disappeared
as
Romero
lurched
clear
to
the
left
and
it
was
over
The
bull
tried
to
go
forward
his
legs
commenced
to
settle
he
swung
from
side
to
side
hesitated
then
went
down
on
his
knees
and
Romero
's
older
brother
leaned
forward
behind
him
and
drove
a
short
knife
into
the
bull
's
neck
at
the
base
of
the
horns
The
first
time
he
missed
He
drove
the
knife
in
again
and
the
bull
went
over
twitching
and
rigid
Romero
's
brother
holding
the
bull
's
horn
in
one
hand
the
knife
in
the
other
looked
up
at
the
President
's
box
Handkerchiefs
were
waving
all
over
the
bull-ring
The
President
looked
down
from
the
box
and
waved
his
handkerchief
The
brother
cut
the
notched
black
ear
from
the
dead
bull
and
trotted
over
with
it
to
Romero
The
bull
lay
heavy
and
black
on
the
sand
his
tongue
out
Boys
were
running
toward
him
from
all
parts
of
the
arena
making
a
little
circle
around
him
They
were
starting
to
dance
around
the
bull
Romero
took
the
ear
from
his
brother
and
held
it
up
toward
the
President
The
President
bowed
and
Romero
running
to
get
ahead
of
the
crowd
came
toward
us
He
leaned
up
against
the
barrera
and
gave
the
ear
to
Brett
He
nodded
his
head
and
smiled
The
crowd
were
all
about
him
Brett
held
down
the
cape
You
liked
it
Romero
called
Brett
did
not
say
anything
They
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
Brett
had
the
ear
in
her
hand
Do
n't
get
bloody
Romero
said
and
grinned
The
crowd
wanted
him
Several
boys
shouted
at
Brett
The
crowd
was
the
boys
the
dancers
and
the
drunks
Romero
turned
and
tried
to
get
through
the
crowd
They
were
all
around
him
trying
to
lift
him
and
put
him
on
their
shoulders
He
fought
and
twisted
away
and
started
running
in
the
midst
of
them
toward
the
exit
He
did
not
want
to
be
carried
on
people
's
shoulders
But
they
held
him
and
lifted
him
It
was
uncomfortable
and
his
legs
were
spraddled
and
his
body
was
very
sore
They
were
lifting
him
and
all
running
toward
the
gate
He
had
his
hand
on
somebody
's
shoulder
He
looked
around
at
us
apologetically
The
crowd
running
went
out
the
gate
with
him
We
all
three
went
back
to
the
hotel
Brett
went
up-stairs
Bill
and
I
sat
in
the
down-stairs
dining-room
and
ate
some
hard-boiled
eggs
and
drank
several
bottles
of
beer
Belmonte
came
down
in
his
street
clothes
with
his
manager
and
two
other
men
They
sat
at
the
next
table
and
ate
Belmonte
ate
very
little
They
were
leaving
on
the
seven
o'clock
train
for
Barcelona
Belmonte
wore
a
blue-striped
shirt
and
a
dark
suit
and
ate
soft-boiled
eggs
The
others
ate
a
big
meal
Belmonte
did
not
talk
He
only
answered
questions
Bill
was
tired
after
the
bull-fight
So
was
I
We
both
took
a
bull-fight
very
hard
We
sat
and
ate
the
eggs
and
I
watched
Belmonte
and
the
people
at
his
table
The
men
with
him
were
tough-looking
and
businesslike
Come
on
over
to
the
cafÃ©
Bill
said
I
want
an
absinthe
It
was
the
last
day
of
the
fiesta
Outside
it
was
beginning
to
be
cloudy
again
The
square
was
full
of
people
and
the
fireworks
experts
were
making
up
their
set
pieces
for
the
night
and
covering
them
over
with
beech
branches
Boys
were
watching
We
passed
stands
of
rockets
with
long
bamboo
stems
Outside
the
cafÃ©
there
was
a
great
crowd
The
music
and
the
dancing
were
going
on
The
giants
and
the
dwarfs
were
passing
Where
's
Edna
I
asked
Bill
I
do
n't
know
We
watched
the
beginning
of
the
evening
of
the
last
night
of
the
fiesta
The
absinthe
made
everything
seem
better
I
drank
it
without
sugar
in
the
dripping
glass
and
it
was
pleasantly
bitter
I
feel
sorry
about
Cohn
Bill
said
He
had
an
awful
time
Oh
to
hell
with
Cohn
I
said
Where
do
you
suppose
he
went
Up
to
Paris
What
do
you
suppose
he
'll
do
Oh
to
hell
with
him
What
do
you
suppose
he
'll
do
Pick
up
with
his
old
girl
probably
Who
was
his
old
girl
Somebody
named
Frances
We
had
another
absinthe
When
do
you
go
back
I
asked
To-morrow
After
a
little
while
Bill
said
Well
it
was
a
swell
fiesta
Yes
I
said
something
doing
all
the
time
You
would
n't
believe
it
It
's
like
a
wonderful
nightmare
Sure
I
said
I
'd
believe
anything
Including
nightmares
What
's
the
matter
Feel
low
Low
as
hell
Have
another
absinthe
Here
waiter
Another
absinthe
for
this
seÃ±or
I
feel
like
hell
I
said
Drink
that
said
Bill
Drink
it
slow
It
was
beginning
to
get
dark
The
fiesta
was
going
on
I
began
to
feel
drunk
but
I
did
not
feel
any
better
How
do
you
feel
I
feel
like
hell
Have
another
It
wo
n't
do
any
good
Try
it
You
ca
n't
tell
maybe
this
is
the
one
that
gets
it
Hey
waiter
Another
absinthe
for
this
seÃ±or
I
poured
the
water
directly
into
it
and
stirred
it
instead
of
letting
it
drip
Bill
put
in
a
lump
of
ice
I
stirred
the
ice
around
with
a
spoon
in
the
brownish
cloudy
mixture
How
is
it
Fine
Do
n't
drink
it
fast
that
way
It
will
make
you
sick
I
set
down
the
glass
I
had
not
meant
to
drink
it
fast
I
feel
tight
You
ought
to
That
's
what
you
wanted
was
n't
it
Sure
Get
tight
Get
over
your
damn
depression
Well
I
'm
tight
Is
that
what
you
want
Sit
down
I
wo
n't
sit
down
I
said
I
'm
going
over
to
the
hotel
I
was
very
drunk
I
was
drunker
than
I
ever
remembered
having
been
At
the
hotel
I
went
up-stairs
Brett
's
door
was
open
I
put
my
head
in
the
room
Mike
was
sitting
on
the
bed
He
waved
a
bottle
Jake
he
said
Come
in
Jake
I
went
in
and
sat
down
The
room
was
unstable
unless
I
looked
at
some
fixed
point
Brett
you
know
She
's
gone
off
with
the
bull-fighter
chap
No
Yes
She
looked
for
you
to
say
good-bye
They
went
on
the
seven
o'clock
train
Did
they
Bad
thing
to
do
Mike
said
She
should
n't
have
done
it
No
Have
a
drink
Wait
while
I
ring
for
some
beer
I
'm
drunk
I
said
I
'm
going
in
and
lie
down
Are
you
blind
I
was
blind
myself
Yes
I
said
I
'm
blind
Well
bung-o
Mike
said
Get
some
sleep
old
Jake
I
went
out
the
door
and
into
my
own
room
and
lay
on
the
bed
The
bed
went
sailing
off
and
I
sat
up
in
bed
and
looked
at
the
wall
to
make
it
stop
Outside
in
the
square
the
fiesta
was
going
on
It
did
not
mean
anything
Later
Bill
and
Mike
came
in
to
get
me
to
go
down
and
eat
with
them
I
pretended
to
be
asleep
He
's
asleep
Better
let
him
alone
He
's
blind
as
a
tick
Mike
said
They
went
out
I
got
up
and
went
to
the
balcony
and
looked
out
at
the
dancing
in
the
square
The
world
was
not
wheeling
any
more
It
was
just
very
clear
and
bright
and
inclined
to
blur
at
the
edges
I
washed
brushed
my
hair
I
looked
strange
to
myself
in
the
glass
and
went
down-stairs
to
the
dining-room
Here
he
is
said
Bill
Good
old
Jake
I
knew
you
would
n't
pass
out
Hello
you
old
drunk
Mike
said
I
got
hungry
and
woke
up
Eat
some
soup
Bill
said
The
three
of
us
sat
at
the
table
and
it
seemed
as
though
about
six
people
were
missing
In
the
morning
it
was
all
over
The
fiesta
was
finished
I
woke
about
nine
o'clock
had
a
bath
dressed
and
went
down-stairs
The
square
was
empty
and
there
were
no
people
on
the
streets
A
few
children
were
picking
up
rocket-sticks
in
the
square
The
cafÃ©s
were
just
opening
and
the
waiters
were
carrying
out
the
comfortable
white
wicker
chairs
and
arranging
them
around
the
marble-topped
tables
in
the
shade
of
the
arcade
They
were
sweeping
the
streets
and
sprinkling
them
with
a
hose
I
sat
in
one
of
the
wicker
chairs
and
leaned
back
comfortably
The
waiter
was
in
no
hurry
to
come
The
white-paper
announcements
of
the
unloading
of
the
bulls
and
the
big
schedules
of
special
trains
were
still
up
on
the
pillars
of
the
arcade
A
waiter
wearing
a
blue
apron
came
out
with
a
bucket
of
water
and
a
cloth
and
commenced
to
tear
down
the
notices
pulling
the
paper
off
in
strips
and
washing
and
rubbing
away
the
paper
that
stuck
to
the
stone
The
fiesta
was
over
I
drank
a
coffee
and
after
a
while
Bill
came
over
I
watched
him
come
walking
across
the
square
He
sat
down
at
the
table
and
ordered
a
coffee
Well
he
said
it
's
all
over
Yes
I
said
When
do
you
go
I
do
n't
know
We
better
get
a
car
I
think
Are
n't
you
going
back
to
Paris
No
I
can
stay
away
another
week
I
think
I
'll
go
to
San
Sebastian
I
want
to
get
back
What
's
Mike
going
to
do
He
's
going
to
Saint
Jean
de
Luz
Let
's
get
a
car
and
all
go
as
far
as
Bayonne
You
can
get
the
train
up
from
there
to-night
Good
Let
's
go
after
lunch
All
right
I
'll
get
the
car
We
had
lunch
and
paid
the
bill
Montoya
did
not
come
near
us
One
of
the
maids
brought
the
bill
The
car
was
outside
The
chauffeur
piled
and
strapped
the
bags
on
top
of
the
car
and
put
them
in
beside
him
in
the
front
seat
and
we
got
in
The
car
went
out
of
the
square
along
through
the
side
streets
out
under
the
trees
and
down
the
hill
and
away
from
Pamplona
It
did
not
seem
like
a
very
long
ride
Mike
had
a
bottle
of
Fundador
I
only
took
a
couple
of
drinks
We
came
over
the
mountains
and
out
of
Spain
and
down
the
white
roads
and
through
the
overfoliaged
wet
green
Basque
country
and
finally
into
Bayonne
We
left
Bill
's
baggage
at
the
station
and
he
bought
a
ticket
to
Paris
His
train
left
at
seven-ten
We
came
out
of
the
station
The
car
was
standing
out
in
front
What
shall
we
do
about
the
car
Bill
asked
Oh
bother
the
car
Mike
said
Let
's
just
keep
the
car
with
us
All
right
Bill
said
Where
shall
we
go
Let
's
go
to
Biarritz
and
have
a
drink
Old
Mike
the
spender
Bill
said
We
drove
in
to
Biarritz
and
left
the
car
outside
a
very
Ritz
place
We
went
into
the
bar
and
sat
on
high
stools
and
drank
a
whiskey
and
soda
That
drink
's
mine
Mike
said
Let
's
roll
for
it
So
we
rolled
poker
dice
out
of
a
deep
leather
dice-cup
Bill
was
out
first
roll
Mike
lost
to
me
and
handed
the
bartender
a
hundred-franc
note
The
whiskeys
were
twelve
francs
apiece
We
had
another
round
and
Mike
lost
again
Each
time
he
gave
the
bartender
a
good
tip
In
a
room
off
the
bar
there
was
a
good
jazz
band
playing
It
was
a
pleasant
bar
We
had
another
round
I
went
out
on
the
first
roll
with
four
kings
Bill
and
Mike
rolled
Mike
won
the
first
roll
with
four
jacks
Bill
won
the
second
On
the
final
roll
Mike
had
three
kings
and
let
them
stay
He
handed
the
dice-cup
to
Bill
Bill
rattled
them
and
rolled
and
there
were
three
kings
an
ace
and
a
queen
It
's
yours
Mike
Bill
said
Old
Mike
the
gambler
I
'm
so
sorry
Mike
said
I
ca
n't
get
it
What
's
the
matter
I
've
no
money
Mike
said
I
'm
stony
I
've
just
twenty
francs
Here
take
twenty
francs
Bill
's
face
sort
of
changed
I
just
had
enough
to
pay
Montoya
Damned
lucky
to
have
it
too
I
'll
cash
you
a
check
Bill
said
That
's
damned
nice
of
you
but
you
see
I
ca
n't
write
checks
What
are
you
going
to
do
for
money
Oh
some
will
come
through
I
've
two
weeks
allowance
should
be
here
I
can
live
on
tick
at
this
pub
in
Saint
Jean
What
do
you
want
to
do
about
the
car
Bill
asked
me
Do
you
want
to
keep
it
on
It
does
n't
make
any
difference
Seems
sort
of
idiotic
Come
on
let
's
have
another
drink
Mike
said
Fine
This
one
is
on
me
Bill
said
Has
Brett
any
money
He
turned
to
Mike
I
should
n't
think
so
She
put
up
most
of
what
I
gave
to
old
Montoya
She
has
n't
any
money
with
her
I
asked
I
should
n't
think
so
She
never
has
any
money
She
gets
five
hundred
quid
a
year
and
pays
three
hundred
and
fifty
of
it
in
interest
to
Jews
I
suppose
they
get
it
at
the
source
said
Bill
Quite
They
're
not
really
Jews
We
just
call
them
Jews
They
're
Scotsmen
I
believe
Has
n't
she
any
at
all
with
her
I
asked
I
hardly
think
so
She
gave
it
all
to
me
when
she
left
Well
Bill
said
we
might
as
well
have
another
drink
Damned
good
idea
Mike
said
One
never
gets
anywhere
by
discussing
finances
No
said
Bill
Bill
and
I
rolled
for
the
next
two
rounds
Bill
lost
and
paid
We
went
out
to
the
car
Anywhere
you
'd
like
to
go
Mike
Bill
asked
Let
's
take
a
drive
It
might
do
my
credit
good
Let
's
drive
about
a
little
Fine
I
'd
like
to
see
the
coast
Let
's
drive
down
toward
Hendaye
I
have
n't
any
credit
along
the
coast
You
ca
n't
ever
tell
said
Bill
We
drove
out
along
the
coast
road
There
was
the
green
of
the
headlands
the
white
red-roofed
villas
patches
of
forest
and
the
ocean
very
blue
with
the
tide
out
and
the
water
curling
far
out
along
the
beach
We
drove
through
Saint
Jean
de
Luz
and
passed
through
villages
farther
down
the
coast
Back
of
the
rolling
country
we
were
going
through
we
saw
the
mountains
we
had
come
over
from
Pamplona
The
road
went
on
ahead
Bill
looked
at
his
watch
It
was
time
for
us
to
go
back
He
knocked
on
the
glass
and
told
the
driver
to
turn
around
The
driver
backed
the
car
out
into
the
grass
to
turn
it
In
back
of
us
were
the
woods
below
a
stretch
of
meadow
then
the
sea
At
the
hotel
where
Mike
was
going
to
stay
in
Saint
Jean
we
stopped
the
car
and
he
got
out
The
chauffeur
carried
in
his
bags
Mike
stood
by
the
side
of
the
car
Good-bye
you
chaps
Mike
said
It
was
a
damned
fine
fiesta
So
long
Mike
Bill
said
I
'll
see
you
around
I
said
Do
n't
worry
about
money
Mike
said
You
can
pay
for
the
car
Jake
and
I
'll
send
you
my
share
So
long
Mike
So
long
you
chaps
You
've
been
damned
nice
We
all
shook
hands
We
waved
from
the
car
to
Mike
He
stood
in
the
road
watching
We
got
to
Bayonne
just
before
the
train
left
A
porter
carried
Bill
's
bags
in
from
the
consigne
I
went
as
far
as
the
inner
gate
to
the
tracks
So
long
fella
Bill
said
So
long
kid
It
was
swell
I
've
had
a
swell
time
Will
you
be
in
Paris
No
I
have
to
sail
on
the
17th
So
long
fella
So
long
old
kid
He
went
in
through
the
gate
to
the
train
The
porter
went
ahead
with
the
bags
I
watched
the
train
pull
out
Bill
was
at
one
of
the
windows
The
window
passed
the
rest
of
the
train
passed
and
the
tracks
were
empty
I
went
outside
to
the
car
How
much
do
we
owe
you
I
asked
the
driver
The
price
to
Bayonne
had
been
fixed
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
pesetas
Two
hundred
pesetas
How
much
more
will
it
be
if
you
drive
me
to
San
Sebastian
on
your
way
back
Fifty
pesetas
Do
n't
kid
me
Thirty-five
pesetas
It
's
not
worth
it
I
said
Drive
me
to
the
Hotel
Panier
Fleuri
At
the
hotel
I
paid
the
driver
and
gave
him
a
tip
The
car
was
powdered
with
dust
I
rubbed
the
rod-case
through
the
dust
It
seemed
the
last
thing
that
connected
me
with
Spain
and
the
fiesta
The
driver
put
the
car
in
gear
and
went
down
the
street
I
watched
it
turn
off
to
take
the
road
to
Spain
I
went
into
the
hotel
and
they
gave
me
a
room
It
was
the
same
room
I
had
slept
in
when
Bill
and
Cohn
and
I
were
in
Bayonne
That
seemed
a
very
long
time
ago
I
washed
changed
my
shirt
and
went
out
in
the
town
At
a
newspaper
kiosque
I
bought
a
copy
of
the
New
York
Herald
and
sat
in
a
cafÃ©
to
read
it
It
felt
strange
to
be
in
France
again
There
was
a
safe
suburban
feeling
I
wished
I
had
gone
up
to
Paris
with
Bill
except
that
Paris
would
have
meant
more
fiesta-ing
I
was
through
with
fiestas
for
a
while
It
would
be
quiet
in
San
Sebastian
The
season
does
not
open
there
until
August
I
could
get
a
good
hotel
room
and
read
and
swim
There
was
a
fine
beach
there
There
were
wonderful
trees
along
the
promenade
above
the
beach
and
there
were
many
children
sent
down
with
their
nurses
before
the
season
opened
In
the
evening
there
would
be
band
concerts
under
the
trees
across
from
the
CafÃ©
Marinas
I
could
sit
in
the
Marinas
and
listen
How
does
one
eat
inside
I
asked
the
waiter
Inside
the
cafÃ©
was
a
restaurant
Well
Very
well
One
eats
very
well
Good
I
went
in
and
ate
dinner
It
was
a
big
meal
for
France
but
it
seemed
very
carefully
apportioned
after
Spain
I
drank
a
bottle
of
wine
for
company
It
