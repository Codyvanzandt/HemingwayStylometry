face
was
still
taut
and
sallow
but
he
cheered
up
finally
He
could
not
stop
looking
at
Brett
It
seemed
to
make
him
happy
It
must
have
been
pleasant
for
him
to
see
her
looking
so
lovely
and
know
he
had
been
away
with
her
and
that
every
one
knew
it
They
could
not
take
that
away
from
him
Bill
was
very
funny
So
was
Michael
They
were
good
together
It
was
like
certain
dinners
I
remember
from
the
war
There
was
much
wine
an
ignored
tension
and
a
feeling
of
things
coming
that
you
could
not
prevent
happening
Under
the
wine
I
lost
the
disgusted
feeling
and
was
happy
It
seemed
they
were
all
such
nice
people
I
do
not
know
what
time
I
got
to
bed
I
remember
undressing
putting
on
a
bathrobe
and
standing
out
on
the
balcony
I
knew
I
was
quite
drunk
and
when
I
came
in
I
put
on
the
light
over
the
head
of
the
bed
and
started
to
read
I
was
reading
a
book
by
Turgenieff
Probably
I
read
the
same
two
pages
over
several
times
It
was
one
of
the
stories
in
A
Sportsman
's
Sketches
I
had
read
it
before
but
it
seemed
quite
new
The
country
became
very
clear
and
the
feeling
of
pressure
in
my
head
seemed
to
loosen
I
was
very
drunk
and
I
did
not
want
to
shut
my
eyes
because
the
room
would
go
round
and
round
If
I
kept
on
reading
that
feeling
would
pass
I
heard
Brett
and
Robert
Cohn
come
up
the
stairs
Cohn
said
good
night
outside
the
door
and
went
on
up
to
his
room
I
heard
Brett
go
into
the
room
next
door
Mike
was
already
in
bed
He
had
come
in
with
me
an
hour
before
He
woke
as
she
came
in
and
they
talked
together
I
heard
them
laugh
I
turned
off
the
light
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
It
was
not
necessary
to
read
any
more
I
could
shut
my
eyes
without
getting
the
wheeling
sensation
But
I
could
not
sleep
There
is
no
reason
why
because
it
is
dark
you
should
look
at
things
differently
from
when
it
is
light
The
hell
there
is
n't
I
figured
that
all
out
once
and
for
six
months
I
never
slept
with
the
electric
light
off
That
was
another
bright
idea
To
hell
with
women
anyway
To
hell
with
you
Brett
Ashley
Women
made
such
swell
friends
Awfully
swell
In
the
first
place
you
had
to
be
in
love
with
a
woman
to
have
a
basis
of
friendship
I
had
been
having
Brett
for
a
friend
I
had
not
been
thinking
about
her
side
of
it
I
had
been
getting
something
for
nothing
That
only
delayed
the
presentation
of
the
bill
The
bill
always
came
That
was
one
of
the
swell
things
you
could
count
on
I
thought
I
had
paid
for
everything
Not
like
the
woman
pays
and
pays
and
pays
No
idea
of
retribution
or
punishment
Just
exchange
of
values
You
gave
up
something
and
got
something
else
Or
you
worked
for
something
You
paid
some
way
for
everything
that
was
any
good
I
paid
my
way
into
enough
things
that
I
liked
so
that
I
had
a
good
time
Either
you
paid
by
learning
about
them
or
by
experience
or
by
taking
chances
or
by
money
Enjoying
living
was
learning
to
get
your
money
's
worth
and
knowing
when
you
had
it
You
could
get
your
money
's
worth
The
world
was
a
good
place
to
buy
in
It
seemed
like
a
fine
philosophy
In
five
years
I
thought
it
will
seem
just
as
silly
as
all
the
other
fine
philosophies
I
've
had
Perhaps
that
was
n't
true
though
Perhaps
as
you
went
along
you
did
learn
something
I
did
not
care
what
it
was
all
about
All
I
wanted
to
know
was
how
to
live
in
it
Maybe
if
you
found
out
how
to
live
in
it
you
learned
from
that
what
it
was
all
about
I
wished
Mike
would
not
behave
so
terribly
to
Cohn
though
Mike
was
a
bad
drunk
Brett
was
a
good
drunk
Bill
was
a
good
drunk
Cohn
was
never
drunk
Mike
was
unpleasant
after
he
passed
a
certain
point
I
liked
to
see
him
hurt
Cohn
I
wished
he
would
not
do
it
though
because
afterward
it
made
me
disgusted
at
myself
That
was
morality
things
that
made
you
disgusted
afterward
No
that
must
be
immorality
That
was
a
large
statement
What
a
lot
of
bilge
I
could
think
up
at
night
What
rot
I
could
hear
Brett
say
it
What
rot
When
you
were
with
English
you
got
into
the
habit
of
using
English
expressions
in
your
thinking
The
English
spoken
language
the
upper
classes
anyway
must
have
fewer
words
than
the
Eskimo
Of
course
I
did
n't
know
anything
about
the
Eskimo
Maybe
the
Eskimo
was
a
fine
language
Say
the
Cherokee
I
did
n't
know
anything
about
the
Cherokee
either
The
English
talked
with
inflected
phrases
One
phrase
to
mean
everything
I
liked
them
though
I
liked
the
way
they
talked
Take
Harris
Still
Harris
was
not
the
upper
classes
I
turned
on
the
light
again
and
read
I
read
the
Turgenieff
I
knew
that
now
reading
it
in
the
oversensitized
state
of
my
mind
after
much
too
much
brandy
I
would
remember
it
somewhere
and
afterward
it
would
seem
as
though
it
had
really
happened
to
me
I
would
always
have
it
That
was
another
good
thing
you
paid
for
and
then
had
Some
time
along
toward
daylight
I
went
to
sleep
The
next
two
days
in
Pamplona
were
quiet
and
there
were
no
more
rows
The
town
was
getting
ready
for
the
fiesta
Workmen
put
up
the
gate-posts
that
were
to
shut
off
the
side
streets
when
the
bulls
were
released
from
the
corrals
and
came
running
through
the
streets
in
the
morning
on
their
way
to
the
ring
The
workmen
dug
holes
and
fitted
in
the
timbers
each
timber
numbered
for
its
regular
place
Out
on
the
plateau
beyond
the
town
employees
of
the
bull-ring
exercised
picador
horses
galloping
them
stiff-legged
on
the
hard
sun-baked
fields
behind
the
bull-ring
The
big
gate
of
the
bull-ring
was
open
and
inside
the
amphitheatre
was
being
swept
The
ring
was
rolled
and
sprinkled
and
carpenters
replaced
weakened
or
cracked
planks
in
the
barrera
Standing
at
the
edge
of
the
smooth
rolled
sand
you
could
look
up
in
the
empty
stands
and
see
old
women
sweeping
out
the
boxes
Outside
the
fence
that
led
from
the
last
street
of
the
town
to
the
entrance
of
the
bull-ring
was
already
in
place
and
made
a
long
pen
the
crowd
would
come
running
down
with
the
bulls
behind
them
on
the
morning
of
the
day
of
the
first
bull-fight
Out
across
the
plain
where
the
horse
and
cattle
fair
would
be
some
gypsies
had
camped
under
the
trees
The
wine
and
aguardiente
sellers
were
putting
up
their
booths
One
booth
advertised
ANIS
DEL
TORO
The
cloth
sign
hung
against
the
planks
in
the
hot
sun
In
the
big
square
that
was
the
centre
of
the
town
there
was
no
change
yet
We
sat
in
the
white
wicker
chairs
on
the
terrasse
of
the
café
and
watched
the
motor-buses
come
in
and
unload
peasants
from
the
country
coming
in
to
the
market
and
we
watched
the
buses
fill
up
and
start
out
with
peasants
sitting
with
their
saddle-bags
full
of
the
things
they
had
bought
in
the
town
The
tall
gray
motor-buses
were
the
only
life
of
the
square
except
for
the
pigeons
and
the
man
with
a
hose
who
sprinkled
the
gravelled
square
and
watered
the
streets
In
the
evening
was
the
paseo
For
an
hour
after
dinner
every
one
all
the
good-looking
girls
the
officers
from
the
garrison
all
the
fashionable
people
of
the
town
walked
in
the
street
on
one
side
of
the
square
while
the
café
tables
filled
with
the
regular
after-dinner
crowd
During
the
morning
I
usually
sat
in
the
café
and
read
the
Madrid
papers
and
then
walked
in
the
town
or
out
into
the
country
Sometimes
Bill
went
along
Sometimes
he
wrote
in
his
room
Robert
Cohn
spent
the
mornings
studying
Spanish
or
trying
to
get
a
shave
at
the
barber-shop
Brett
and
Mike
never
got
up
until
noon
We
all
had
a
vermouth
at
the
café
It
was
a
quiet
life
and
no
one
was
drunk
I
went
to
church
a
couple
of
times
once
with
Brett
She
said
she
wanted
to
hear
me
go
to
confession
but
I
told
her
that
not
only
was
it
impossible
but
it
was
not
as
interesting
as
it
sounded
and
besides
it
would
be
in
a
language
she
did
not
know
We
met
Cohn
as
we
came
out
of
church
and
although
it
was
obvious
he
had
followed
us
yet
he
was
very
pleasant
and
nice
and
we
all
three
went
for
a
walk
out
to
the
gypsy
camp
and
Brett
had
her
fortune
told
It
was
a
good
morning
there
were
high
white
clouds
above
the
mountains
It
had
rained
a
little
in
the
night
and
it
was
fresh
and
cool
on
the
plateau
and
there
was
a
wonderful
view
We
all
felt
good
and
we
felt
healthy
and
I
felt
quite
friendly
to
Cohn
You
could
not
be
upset
about
anything
on
a
day
like
that
That
was
the
last
day
before
the
fiesta
At
noon
of
Sunday
the
6th
of
July
the
fiesta
exploded
There
is
no
other
way
to
describe
it
People
had
been
coming
in
all
day
from
the
country
but
they
were
assimilated
in
the
town
and
you
did
not
notice
them
The
square
was
as
quiet
in
the
hot
sun
as
on
any
other
day
The
peasants
were
in
the
outlying
wine-shops
There
they
were
drinking
getting
ready
for
the
fiesta
They
had
come
in
so
recently
from
the
plains
and
the
hills
that
it
was
necessary
that
they
make
their
shifting
in
values
gradually
They
could
not
start
in
paying
café
prices
They
got
their
money
's
worth
in
the
wine-shops
Money
still
had
a
definite
value
in
hours
worked
and
bushels
of
grain
sold
Late
in
the
fiesta
it
would
not
matter
what
they
paid
nor
where
they
bought
Now
on
the
day
of
the
starting
of
the
fiesta
of
San
Fermin
they
had
been
in
the
wine-shops
of
the
narrow
streets
of
the
town
since
early
morning
Going
down
the
streets
in
the
morning
on
the
way
to
mass
in
the
cathedral
I
heard
them
singing
through
the
open
doors
of
the
shops
They
were
warming
up
There
were
many
people
at
the
eleven
o'clock
mass
San
Fermin
is
also
a
religious
festival
I
walked
down
the
hill
from
the
cathedral
and
up
the
street
to
the
café
on
the
square
It
was
a
little
before
noon
Robert
Cohn
and
Bill
were
sitting
at
one
of
the
tables
The
marble-topped
tables
and
the
white
wicker
chairs
were
gone
They
were
replaced
by
cast-iron
tables
and
severe
folding
chairs
The
café
was
like
a
battleship
stripped
for
action
To-day
the
waiters
did
not
leave
you
alone
all
morning
to
read
without
asking
if
you
wanted
to
order
something
A
waiter
came
up
as
soon
as
I
sat
down
What
are
you
drinking
I
asked
Bill
and
Robert
Sherry
Cohn
said
Jerez
I
said
to
the
waiter
Before
the
waiter
brought
the
sherry
the
rocket
that
announced
the
fiesta
went
up
in
the
square
It
burst
and
there
was
a
gray
ball
of
smoke
high
up
above
the
Theatre
Gayarre
across
on
the
other
side
of
the
plaza
The
ball
of
smoke
hung
in
the
sky
like
a
shrapnel
burst
and
as
I
watched
another
rocket
came
up
to
it
trickling
smoke
in
the
bright
sunlight
I
saw
the
bright
flash
as
it
burst
and
another
little
cloud
of
smoke
appeared
By
the
time
the
second
rocket
had
burst
there
were
so
many
people
in
the
arcade
that
had
been
empty
a
minute
before
that
the
waiter
holding
the
bottle
high
up
over
his
head
could
hardly
get
through
the
crowd
to
our
table
People
were
coming
into
the
square
from
all
sides
and
down
the
street
we
heard
the
pipes
and
the
fifes
and
the
drums
coming
They
were
playing
the
riau-riau
music
the
pipes
shrill
and
the
drums
pounding
and
behind
them
came
the
men
and
boys
dancing
When
the
fifers
stopped
they
all
crouched
down
in
the
street
and
when
the
reed-pipes
and
the
fifes
shrilled
and
the
flat
dry
hollow
drums
tapped
it
out
again
they
all
went
up
in
the
air
dancing
In
the
crowd
you
saw
only
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
dancers
going
up
and
down
In
the
square
a
man
bent
over
was
playing
on
a
reed-pipe
and
a
crowd
of
children
were
following
him
shouting
and
pulling
at
his
clothes
He
came
out
of
the
square
the
children
following
him
and
piped
them
past
the
café
and
down
a
side
street
We
saw
his
blank
pockmarked
face
as
he
went
by
piping
the
children
close
behind
him
shouting
and
pulling
at
him
He
must
be
the
village
idiot
Bill
said
My
God
look
at
that
Down
the
street
came
dancers
The
street
was
solid
with
dancers
all
men
They
were
all
dancing
in
time
behind
their
own
fifers
and
drummers
They
were
a
club
of
some
sort
and
all
wore
workmen
's
blue
smocks
and
red
handkerchiefs
around
their
necks
and
carried
a
great
banner
on
two
poles
The
banner
danced
up
and
down
with
them
as
they
came
down
surrounded
by
the
crowd
Hurray
for
Wine
Hurray
for
the
Foreigners
was
painted
on
the
banner
Where
are
the
foreigners
Robert
Cohn
asked
We
're
the
foreigners
Bill
said
All
the
time
rockets
were
going
up
The
café
tables
were
all
full
now
The
square
was
emptying
of
people
and
the
crowd
was
filling
the
cafés
Where
's
Brett
and
Mike
Bill
asked
I
'll
go
and
get
them
Cohn
said
Bring
them
here
The
fiesta
was
really
started
It
kept
up
day
and
night
for
seven
days
The
dancing
kept
up
the
drinking
kept
up
the
noise
went
on
The
things
that
happened
could
only
have
happened
during
a
fiesta
Everything
became
quite
unreal
finally
and
it
seemed
as
though
nothing
could
have
any
consequences
It
seemed
out
of
place
to
think
of
consequences
during
the
fiesta
All
during
the
fiesta
you
had
the
feeling
even
when
it
was
quiet
that
you
had
to
shout
any
remark
to
make
it
heard
It
was
the
same
feeling
about
any
action
It
was
a
fiesta
and
it
went
on
for
seven
days
That
afternoon
was
the
big
religious
procession
San
Fermin
was
translated
from
one
church
to
another
In
the
procession
were
all
the
dignitaries
civil
and
religious
We
could
not
see
them
because
the
crowd
was
too
great
Ahead
of
the
formal
procession
and
behind
it
danced
the
riau-riau
dancers
There
was
one
mass
of
yellow
shirts
dancing
up
and
down
in
the
crowd
All
we
could
see
of
the
procession
through
the
closely
pressed
people
that
crowded
all
the
side
streets
and
curbs
were
the
great
giants
cigar-store
Indians
thirty
feet
high
Moors
a
King
and
Queen
whirling
and
waltzing
solemnly
to
the
riau-riau
They
were
all
standing
outside
the
chapel
where
San
Fermin
and
the
dignitaries
had
passed
in
leaving
a
guard
of
soldiers
the
giants
with
the
men
who
danced
in
them
standing
beside
their
resting
frames
and
the
dwarfs
moving
with
their
whacking
bladders
through
the
crowd
We
started
inside
and
there
was
a
smell
of
incense
and
people
filing
back
into
the
church
but
Brett
was
stopped
just
inside
the
door
because
she
had
no
hat
so
we
went
out
again
and
along
the
street
that
ran
back
from
the
chapel
into
town
The
street
was
lined
on
both
sides
with
people
keeping
their
place
at
the
curb
for
the
return
of
the
procession
Some
dancers
formed
a
circle
around
Brett
and
started
to
dance
They
wore
big
wreaths
of
white
garlics
around
their
necks
They
took
Bill
and
me
by
the
arms
and
put
us
in
the
circle
Bill
started
to
dance
too
They
were
all
chanting
Brett
wanted
to
dance
but
they
did
not
want
her
to
They
wanted
her
as
an
image
to
dance
around
When
the
song
ended
with
the
sharp
riau-riau
they
rushed
us
into
a
wine-shop
We
stood
at
the
counter
They
had
Brett
seated
on
a
wine-cask
It
was
dark
in
the
wine-shop
and
full
of
men
singing
hard-voiced
singing
Back
of
the
counter
they
drew
the
wine
from
casks
I
put
down
money
for
the
wine
but
one
of
the
men
picked
it
up
and
put
it
back
in
my
pocket
I
want
a
leather
wine-bottle
Bill
said
There
's
a
place
down
the
street
I
said
I
'll
go
get
a
couple
The
dancers
did
not
want
me
to
go
out
Three
of
them
were
sitting
on
the
high
wine-cask
beside
Brett
teaching
her
to
drink
out
of
the
wine-skins
They
had
hung
a
wreath
of
garlics
around
her
neck
Some
one
insisted
on
giving
her
a
glass
Somebody
was
teaching
Bill
a
song
Singing
it
into
his
ear
Beating
time
on
Bill
's
back
I
explained
to
them
that
I
would
be
back
Outside
in
the
street
I
went
down
the
street
looking
for
the
shop
that
made
leather
wine-bottles
The
crowd
was
packed
on
the
sidewalks
and
many
of
the
shops
were
shuttered
and
I
could
not
find
it
I
walked
as
far
as
the
church
looking
on
both
sides
of
the
street
Then
I
asked
a
man
and
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
led
me
to
it
The
shutters
were
up
but
the
door
was
open
Inside
it
smelled
of
fresh
tanned
leather
and
hot
tar
A
man
was
stencilling
completed
wine-skins
They
hung
from
the
roof
in
bunches
He
took
one
down
blew
it
up
screwed
the
nozzle
tight
and
then
jumped
on
it
See
It
does
n't
leak
I
want
another
one
too
A
big
one
He
took
down
a
big
one
that
would
hold
a
gallon
or
more
from
the
roof
He
blew
it
up
his
cheeks
puffing
ahead
of
the
wine-skin
and
stood
on
the
bota
holding
on
to
a
chair
What
are
you
going
to
do
Sell
them
in
Bayonne
No
Drink
out
of
them
He
slapped
me
on
the
back
Good
man
Eight
pesetas
for
the
two
The
lowest
price
The
man
who
was
stencilling
the
new
ones
and
tossing
them
into
a
pile
stopped
It
's
true
he
said
Eight
pesetas
is
cheap
I
paid
and
went
out
and
along
the
street
back
to
the
wine-shop
It
was
darker
than
ever
inside
and
very
crowded
I
did
not
see
Brett
and
Bill
and
some
one
said
they
were
in
the
back
room
At
the
counter
the
girl
filled
the
two
wine-skins
for
me
One
held
two
litres
The
other
held
five
litres
Filling
them
both
cost
three
pesetas
sixty
centimos
Some
one
at
the
counter
that
I
had
never
seen
before
tried
to
pay
for
the
wine
but
I
finally
paid
for
it
myself
The
man
who
had
wanted
to
pay
then
bought
me
a
drink
He
would
not
let
me
buy
one
in
return
but
said
he
would
take
a
rinse
of
the
mouth
from
the
new
wine-bag
He
tipped
the
big
five-litre
bag
up
and
squeezed
it
so
the
wine
hissed
against
the
back
of
his
throat
All
right
he
said
and
handed
back
the
bag
In
the
back
room
Brett
and
Bill
were
sitting
on
barrels
surrounded
by
the
dancers
Everybody
had
his
arms
on
everybody
else
's
shoulders
and
they
were
all
singing
Mike
was
sitting
at
a
table
with
several
men
in
their
shirt-sleeves
eating
from
a
bowl
of
tuna
fish
chopped
onions
and
vinegar
They
were
all
drinking
wine
and
mopping
up
the
oil
and
vinegar
with
pieces
of
bread
Hello
Jake
Hello
Mike
called
Come
here
I
want
you
to
meet
my
friends
We
're
all
having
an
hors-d'oeuvre
I
was
introduced
to
the
people
at
the
table
They
supplied
their
names
to
Mike
and
sent
for
a
fork
for
me
Stop
eating
their
dinner
Michael
Brett
shouted
from
the
wine-barrels
I
do
n't
want
to
eat
up
your
meal
I
said
when
some
one
handed
me
a
fork
Eat
he
said
What
do
you
think
it
's
here
for
I
unscrewed
the
nozzle
of
the
big
wine-bottle
and
handed
it
around
Every
one
took
a
drink
tipping
the
wine-skin
at
arm
's
length
Outside
above
the
singing
we
could
hear
the
music
of
the
procession
going
by
Is
n't
that
the
procession
Mike
asked
Nada
some
one
said
It
's
nothing
Drink
up
Lift
the
bottle
Where
did
they
find
you
I
asked
Mike
Some
one
brought
me
here
Mike
said
They
said
you
were
here
Where
's
Cohn
He
's
passed
out
Brett
called
They
've
put
him
away
somewhere
Where
is
he
I
do
n't
know
How
should
we
know
Bill
said
I
think
he
's
dead
He
's
not
dead
Mike
said
I
know
he
's
not
dead
He
's
just
passed
out
on
Anis
del
Mono
As
he
said
Anis
del
Mono
one
of
the
men
at
the
table
looked
up
brought
out
a
bottle
from
inside
his
smock
and
handed
it
to
me
No
I
said
No
thanks
Yes
Yes
Arriba
Up
with
the
bottle
I
took
a
drink
It
tasted
of
licorice
and
warmed
all
the
way
I
could
feel
it
warming
in
my
stomach
Where
the
hell
is
Cohn
I
do
n't
know
Mike
said
I
'll
ask
Where
is
the
drunken
comrade
he
asked
in
Spanish
You
want
to
see
him
Yes
I
said
Not
me
said
Mike
This
gent
The
Anis
del
Mono
man
wiped
his
mouth
and
stood
up
Come
on
In
a
back
room
Robert
Cohn
was
sleeping
quietly
on
some
wine-casks
It
was
almost
too
dark
to
see
his
face
They
had
covered
him
with
a
coat
and
another
coat
was
folded
under
his
head
Around
his
neck
and
on
his
chest
was
a
big
wreath
of
twisted
garlics
Let
him
sleep
the
man
whispered
He
's
all
right
Two
hours
later
Cohn
appeared
He
came
into
the
front
room
still
with
the
wreath
of
garlics
around
his
neck
The
Spaniards
shouted
when
he
came
in
Cohn
wiped
his
eyes
and
grinned
I
must
have
been
sleeping
he
said
Oh
not
at
all
Brett
said
You
were
only
dead
Bill
said
Are
n't
we
going
to
go
and
have
some
supper
Cohn
asked
Do
you
want
to
eat
Yes
Why
not
I
'm
hungry
Eat
those
garlics
Robert
Mike
said
I
say
Do
eat
those
garlics
Cohn
stood
there
His
sleep
had
made
him
quite
all
right
Do
let
's
go
and
eat
Brett
said
I
must
get
a
bath
Come
on
Bill
said
Let
's
translate
Brett
to
the
hotel
We
said
good-bye
to
many
people
and
shook
hands
with
many
people
and
went
out
Outside
it
was
dark
What
time
is
it
do
you
suppose
Cohn
asked
It
's
to-morrow
Mike
said
You
've
been
asleep
two
days
No
said
Cohn
what
time
is
it
It
's
ten
o'clock
What
a
lot
we
've
drunk
You
mean
what
a
lot
we
've
drunk
You
went
to
sleep
Going
down
the
dark
streets
to
the
hotel
we
saw
the
sky-rockets
going
up
in
the
square
Down
the
side
streets
that
led
to
the
square
we
saw
the
square
solid
with
people
those
in
the
centre
all
dancing
It
was
a
big
meal
at
the
hotel
It
was
the
first
meal
of
the
prices
being
doubled
for
the
fiesta
and
there
were
several
new
courses
After
the
dinner
we
were
out
in
the
town
I
remember
resolving
that
I
would
stay
up
all
night
to
watch
the
bulls
go
through
the
streets
at
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
being
so
sleepy
that
I
went
to
bed
around
four
o'clock
The
others
stayed
up
My
own
room
was
locked
and
I
could
not
find
the
key
so
I
went
up-stairs
and
slept
on
one
of
the
beds
in
Cohn
's
room
The
fiesta
was
going
on
outside
in
the
night
but
I
was
too
sleepy
for
it
to
keep
me
awake
When
I
woke
it
was
the
sound
of
the
rocket
exploding
that
announced
the
release
of
the
bulls
from
the
corrals
at
the
edge
of
town
They
would
race
through
the
streets
and
out
to
the
bull-ring
I
had
been
sleeping
heavily
and
I
woke
feeling
I
was
too
late
I
put
on
a
coat
of
Cohn
's
and
went
out
on
the
balcony
Down
below
the
narrow
street
was
empty
All
the
balconies
were
crowded
with
people
Suddenly
a
crowd
came
down
the
street
They
were
all
running
packed
close
together
They
passed
along
and
up
the
street
toward
the
bull-ring
and
behind
them
came
more
men
running
faster
and
then
some
stragglers
who
were
really
running
Behind
them
was
a
little
bare
space
and
then
the
bulls
galloping
tossing
their
heads
up
and
down
It
all
went
out
of
sight
around
the
corner
One
man
fell
rolled
to
the
gutter
and
lay
quiet
But
the
bulls
went
right
on
and
did
not
notice
him
They
were
all
running
together
After
they
went
out
of
sight
a
great
roar
came
from
the
bull-ring
It
kept
on
Then
finally
the
pop
of
the
rocket
that
meant
the
bulls
had
gotten
through
the
people
in
the
ring
and
into
the
corrals
I
went
back
in
the
room
and
got
into
bed
I
had
been
standing
on
the
stone
balcony
in
bare
feet
I
knew
our
crowd
must
have
all
been
out
at
the
bull-ring
Back
in
bed
I
went
to
sleep
Cohn
woke
me
when
he
came
in
He
started
to
undress
and
went
over
and
closed
the
window
because
the
people
on
the
balcony
of
the
house
just
across
the
street
were
looking
in
Did
you
see
the
show
I
asked
Yes
We
were
all
there
Anybody
get
hurt
One
of
the
bulls
got
into
the
crowd
in
the
ring
and
tossed
six
or
eight
people
How
did
Brett
like
it
It
was
all
so
sudden
there
was
n't
any
time
for
it
to
bother
anybody
I
wish
I
'd
been
up
We
did
n't
know
where
you
were
We
went
to
your
room
but
it
was
locked
Where
did
you
stay
up
We
danced
at
some
club
I
got
sleepy
I
said
My
gosh
I
'm
sleepy
now
Cohn
said
Does
n't
this
thing
ever
stop
Not
for
a
week
Bill
opened
the
door
and
put
his
head
in
Where
were
you
Jake
I
saw
them
go
through
from
the
balcony
How
was
it
Grand
Where
you
going
To
sleep
No
one
was
up
before
noon
We
ate
at
tables
set
out
under
the
arcade
The
town
was
full
of
people
We
had
to
wait
for
a
table
After
lunch
we
went
over
to
the
Iruña
It
had
filled
up
and
as
the
time
for
the
bull-fight
came
it
got
fuller
and
the
tables
were
crowded
closer
There
was
a
close
crowded
hum
that
came
every
day
before
the
bull-fight
The
café
did
not
make
this
same
noise
at
any
other
time
no
matter
how
crowded
it
was
This
hum
went
on
and
we
were
in
it
and
a
part
of
it
I
had
taken
six
seats
for
all
the
fights
Three
of
them
were
barreras
the
first
row
at
the
ring-side
and
three
were
sobrepuertos
seats
with
wooden
backs
half-way
up
the
amphitheatre
Mike
thought
Brett
had
best
sit
high
up
for
her
first
time
and
Cohn
wanted
to
sit
with
them
Bill
and
I
were
going
to
sit
in
the
barreras
and
I
gave
the
extra
ticket
to
a
waiter
to
sell
Bill
said
something
to
Cohn
about
what
to
do
and
how
to
look
so
he
would
not
mind
the
horses
Bill
had
seen
one
season
of
bull-fights
I
'm
not
worried
about
how
I
'll
stand
it
I
'm
only
afraid
I
may
be
bored
Cohn
said
You
think
so
Do
n't
look
at
the
horses
after
the
bull
hits
them
I
said
to
Brett
Watch
the
charge
and
see
the
picador
try
and
keep
the
bull
off
but
then
do
n't
look
again
until
the
horse
is
dead
if
it
's
been
hit
I
'm
a
little
nervy
about
it
Brett
said
I
'm
worried
whether
I
'll
be
able
to
go
through
with
it
all
right
You
'll
be
all
right
There
's
nothing
but
that
horse
part
that
will
bother
you
and
they
're
only
in
for
a
few
minutes
with
each
bull
Just
do
n't
watch
when
it
's
bad
She
'll
be
all
right
Mike
said
I
'll
look
after
her
I
do
n't
think
you
'll
be
bored
Bill
said
I
'm
going
over
to
the
hotel
to
get
the
glasses
and
the
wine-skin
I
said
See
you
back
here
Do
n't
get
cock-eyed
I
'll
come
along
Bill
said
Brett
smiled
at
us
We
walked
around
through
the
arcade
to
avoid
the
heat
of
the
square
That
Cohn
gets
me
Bill
said
He
's
got
this
Jewish
superiority
so
strong
that
he
thinks
the
only
emotion
he
'll
get
out
of
the
fight
will
be
being
bored
We
'll
watch
him
with
the
glasses
I
said
Oh
to
hell
with
him
He
spends
a
lot
of
time
there
I
want
him
to
stay
there
In
the
hotel
on
the
stairs
we
met
Montoya
Come
on
said
Montoya
Do
you
want
to
meet
Pedro
Romero
Fine
said
Bill
Let
's
go
see
him
We
followed
Montoya
