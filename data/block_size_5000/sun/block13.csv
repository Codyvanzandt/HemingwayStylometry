was
a
Château
Margaux
It
was
pleasant
to
be
drinking
slowly
and
to
be
tasting
the
wine
and
to
be
drinking
alone
A
bottle
of
wine
was
good
company
Afterward
I
had
coffee
The
waiter
recommended
a
Basque
liqueur
called
Izzarra
He
brought
in
the
bottle
and
poured
a
liqueur-glass
full
He
said
Izzarra
was
made
of
the
flowers
of
the
Pyrenees
The
veritable
flowers
of
the
Pyrenees
It
looked
like
hair-oil
and
smelled
like
Italian
strega
I
told
him
to
take
the
flowers
of
the
Pyrenees
away
and
bring
me
a
vieux
marc
The
marc
was
good
I
had
a
second
marc
after
the
coffee
The
waiter
seemed
a
little
offended
about
the
flowers
of
the
Pyrenees
so
I
overtipped
him
That
made
him
happy
It
felt
comfortable
to
be
in
a
country
where
it
is
so
simple
to
make
people
happy
You
can
never
tell
whether
a
Spanish
waiter
will
thank
you
Everything
is
on
such
a
clear
financial
basis
in
France
It
is
the
simplest
country
to
live
in
No
one
makes
things
complicated
by
becoming
your
friend
for
any
obscure
reason
If
you
want
people
to
like
you
you
have
only
to
spend
a
little
money
I
spent
a
little
money
and
the
waiter
liked
me
He
appreciated
my
valuable
qualities
He
would
be
glad
to
see
me
back
I
would
dine
there
again
some
time
and
he
would
be
glad
to
see
me
and
would
want
me
at
his
table
It
would
be
a
sincere
liking
because
it
would
have
a
sound
basis
I
was
back
in
France
Next
morning
I
tipped
every
one
a
little
too
much
at
the
hotel
to
make
more
friends
and
left
on
the
morning
train
for
San
Sebastian
At
the
station
I
did
not
tip
the
porter
more
than
I
should
because
I
did
not
think
I
would
ever
see
him
again
I
only
wanted
a
few
good
French
friends
in
Bayonne
to
make
me
welcome
in
case
I
should
come
back
there
again
I
knew
that
if
they
remembered
me
their
friendship
would
be
loyal
At
Irun
we
had
to
change
trains
and
show
passports
I
hated
to
leave
France
Life
was
so
simple
in
France
I
felt
I
was
a
fool
to
be
going
back
into
Spain
In
Spain
you
could
not
tell
about
anything
I
felt
like
a
fool
to
be
going
back
into
it
but
I
stood
in
line
with
my
passport
opened
my
bags
for
the
customs
bought
a
ticket
went
through
a
gate
climbed
onto
the
train
and
after
forty
minutes
and
eight
tunnels
I
was
at
San
Sebastian
Even
on
a
hot
day
San
Sebastian
has
a
certain
early-morning
quality
The
trees
seem
as
though
their
leaves
were
never
quite
dry
The
streets
feel
as
though
they
had
just
been
sprinkled
It
is
always
cool
and
shady
on
certain
streets
on
the
hottest
day
I
went
to
a
hotel
in
the
town
where
I
had
stopped
before
and
they
gave
me
a
room
with
a
balcony
that
opened
out
above
the
roofs
of
the
town
There
was
a
green
mountainside
beyond
the
roofs
I
unpacked
my
bags
and
stacked
my
books
on
the
table
beside
the
head
of
the
bed
put
out
my
shaving
things
hung
up
some
clothes
in
the
big
armoire
and
made
up
a
bundle
for
the
laundry
Then
I
took
a
shower
in
the
bathroom
and
went
down
to
lunch
Spain
had
not
changed
to
summer-time
so
I
was
early
I
set
my
watch
again
I
had
recovered
an
hour
by
coming
to
San
Sebastian
As
I
went
into
the
dining-room
the
concierge
brought
me
a
police
bulletin
to
fill
out
I
signed
it
and
asked
him
for
two
telegraph
forms
and
wrote
a
message
to
the
Hotel
Montoya
telling
them
to
forward
all
mail
and
telegrams
for
me
to
this
address
I
calculated
how
many
days
I
would
be
in
San
Sebastian
and
then
wrote
out
a
wire
to
the
office
asking
them
to
hold
mail
but
forward
all
wires
for
me
to
San
Sebastian
for
six
days
Then
I
went
in
and
had
lunch
After
lunch
I
went
up
to
my
room
read
a
while
and
went
to
sleep
When
I
woke
it
was
half
past
four
I
found
my
swimming-suit
wrapped
it
with
a
comb
in
a
towel
and
went
down-stairs
and
walked
up
the
street
to
the
Concha
The
tide
was
about
half-way
out
The
beach
was
smooth
and
firm
and
the
sand
yellow
I
went
into
a
bathing-cabin
undressed
put
on
my
suit
and
walked
across
the
smooth
sand
to
the
sea
The
sand
was
warm
under
bare
feet
There
were
quite
a
few
people
in
the
water
and
on
the
beach
Out
beyond
where
the
headlands
of
the
Concha
almost
met
to
form
the
harbor
there
was
a
white
line
of
breakers
and
the
open
sea
Although
the
tide
was
going
out
there
were
a
few
slow
rollers
They
came
in
like
undulations
in
the
water
gathered
weight
of
water
and
then
broke
smoothly
on
the
warm
sand
I
waded
out
The
water
was
cold
As
a
roller
came
I
dove
swam
out
under
water
and
came
to
the
surface
with
all
the
chill
gone
I
swam
out
to
the
raft
pulled
myself
up
and
lay
on
the
hot
planks
A
boy
and
girl
were
at
the
other
end
The
girl
had
undone
the
top
strap
of
her
bathing-suit
and
was
browning
her
back
The
boy
lay
face
downward
on
the
raft
and
talked
to
her
She
laughed
at
things
he
said
and
turned
her
brown
back
in
the
sun
I
lay
on
the
raft
in
the
sun
until
I
was
dry
Then
I
tried
several
dives
I
dove
deep
once
swimming
down
to
the
bottom
I
swam
with
my
eyes
open
and
it
was
green
and
dark
The
raft
made
a
dark
shadow
I
came
out
of
water
beside
the
raft
pulled
up
dove
once
more
holding
it
for
length
and
then
swam
ashore
I
lay
on
the
beach
until
I
was
dry
then
went
into
the
bathing-cabin
took
off
my
suit
sloshed
myself
with
fresh
water
and
rubbed
dry
I
walked
around
the
harbor
under
the
trees
to
the
casino
and
then
up
one
of
the
cool
streets
to
the
Café
Marinas
There
was
an
orchestra
playing
inside
the
café
and
I
sat
out
on
the
terrace
and
enjoyed
the
fresh
coolness
in
the
hot
day
and
had
a
glass
of
lemon-juice
and
shaved
ice
and
then
a
long
whiskey
and
soda
I
sat
in
front
of
the
Marinas
for
a
long
time
and
read
and
watched
the
people
and
listened
to
the
music
Later
when
it
began
to
get
dark
I
walked
around
the
harbor
and
out
along
the
promenade
and
finally
back
to
the
hotel
for
supper
There
was
a
bicycle-race
on
the
Tour
du
Pays
Basque
and
the
riders
were
stopping
that
night
in
San
Sebastian
In
the
dining-room
at
one
side
there
was
a
long
table
of
bicycle-riders
eating
with
their
trainers
and
managers
They
were
all
French
and
Belgians
and
paid
close
attention
to
their
meal
but
they
were
having
a
good
time
At
the
head
of
the
table
were
two
good-looking
French
girls
with
much
Rue
du
Faubourg
Montmartre
chic
I
could
not
make
out
whom
they
belonged
to
They
all
spoke
in
slang
at
the
long
table
and
there
were
many
private
jokes
and
some
jokes
at
the
far
end
that
were
not
repeated
when
the
girls
asked
to
hear
them
The
next
morning
at
five
o'clock
the
race
resumed
with
the
last
lap
San
Sebastian-Bilbao
The
bicycle-riders
drank
much
wine
and
were
burned
and
browned
by
the
sun
They
did
not
take
the
race
seriously
except
among
themselves
They
had
raced
among
themselves
so
often
that
it
did
not
make
much
difference
who
won
Especially
in
a
foreign
country
The
money
could
be
arranged
The
man
who
had
a
matter
of
two
minutes
lead
in
the
race
had
an
attack
of
boils
which
were
very
painful
He
sat
on
the
small
of
his
back
His
neck
was
very
red
and
the
blond
hairs
were
sunburned
The
other
riders
joked
him
about
his
boils
He
tapped
on
the
table
with
his
fork
Listen
he
said
to-morrow
my
nose
is
so
tight
on
the
handle-bars
that
the
only
thing
touches
those
boils
is
a
lovely
breeze
One
of
the
girls
looked
at
him
down
the
table
and
he
grinned
and
turned
red
The
Spaniards
they
said
did
not
know
how
to
pedal
I
had
coffee
out
on
the
terrasse
with
the
team
manager
of
one
of
the
big
bicycle
manufacturers
He
said
it
had
been
a
very
pleasant
race
and
would
have
been
worth
watching
if
Bottechia
had
not
abandoned
it
at
Pamplona
The
dust
had
been
bad
but
in
Spain
the
roads
were
better
than
in
France
Bicycle
road-racing
was
the
only
sport
in
the
world
he
said
Had
I
ever
followed
the
Tour
de
France
Only
in
the
papers
The
Tour
de
France
was
the
greatest
sporting
event
in
the
world
Following
and
organizing
the
road
races
had
made
him
know
France
Few
people
know
France
All
spring
and
all
summer
and
all
fall
he
spent
on
the
road
with
bicycle
road-racers
Look
at
the
number
of
motor-cars
now
that
followed
the
riders
from
town
to
town
in
a
road
race
It
was
a
rich
country
and
more
sportif
every
year
It
would
be
the
most
sportif
country
in
the
world
It
was
bicycle
road-racing
did
it
That
and
football
He
knew
France
La
France
Sportive
He
knew
road-racing
We
had
a
cognac
After
all
though
it
was
n't
bad
to
get
back
to
Paris
There
is
only
one
Paname
In
all
the
world
that
is
Paris
is
the
town
the
most
sportif
in
the
world
Did
I
know
the
Chope
de
Negre
Did
I
not
I
would
see
him
there
some
time
I
certainly
would
We
would
drink
another
fine
together
We
certainly
would
They
started
at
six
o'clock
less
a
quarter
in
the
morning
Would
I
be
up
for
the
depart
I
would
certainly
try
to
Would
I
like
him
to
call
me
It
was
very
interesting
I
would
leave
a
call
at
the
desk
He
would
not
mind
calling
me
I
could
not
let
him
take
the
trouble
I
would
leave
a
call
at
the
desk
We
said
good-bye
until
the
next
morning
In
the
morning
when
I
awoke
the
bicycle-riders
and
their
following
cars
had
been
on
the
road
for
three
hours
I
had
coffee
and
the
papers
in
bed
and
then
dressed
and
took
my
bathing-suit
down
to
the
beach
Everything
was
fresh
and
cool
and
damp
in
the
early
morning
Nurses
in
uniform
and
in
peasant
costume
walked
under
the
trees
with
children
The
Spanish
children
were
beautiful
Some
bootblacks
sat
together
under
a
tree
talking
to
a
soldier
The
soldier
had
only
one
arm
The
tide
was
in
and
there
was
a
good
breeze
and
a
surf
on
the
beach
I
undressed
in
one
of
the
bath-cabins
crossed
the
narrow
line
of
beach
and
went
into
the
water
I
swam
out
trying
to
swim
through
the
rollers
but
having
to
dive
sometimes
Then
in
the
quiet
water
I
turned
and
floated
Floating
I
saw
only
the
sky
and
felt
the
drop
and
lift
of
the
swells
I
swam
back
to
the
surf
and
coasted
in
face
down
on
a
big
roller
then
turned
and
swam
trying
to
keep
in
the
trough
and
not
have
a
wave
break
over
me
It
made
me
tired
swimming
in
the
trough
and
I
turned
and
swam
out
to
the
raft
The
water
was
buoyant
and
cold
It
felt
as
though
you
could
never
sink
I
swam
slowly
it
seemed
like
a
long
swim
with
the
high
tide
and
then
pulled
up
on
the
raft
and
sat
dripping
on
the
boards
that
were
becoming
hot
in
the
sun
I
looked
around
at
the
bay
the
old
town
the
casino
the
line
of
trees
along
the
promenade
and
the
big
hotels
with
their
white
porches
and
gold-lettered
names
Off
on
the
right
almost
closing
the
harbor
was
a
green
hill
with
a
castle
The
raft
rocked
with
the
motion
of
the
water
On
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
gap
that
led
into
the
open
sea
was
another
high
headland
I
thought
I
would
like
to
swim
across
the
bay
but
I
was
afraid
of
cramp
I
sat
in
the
sun
and
watched
the
bathers
on
the
beach
They
looked
very
small
After
a
while
I
stood
up
gripped
with
my
toes
on
the
edge
of
the
raft
as
it
tipped
with
my
weight
and
dove
cleanly
and
deeply
to
come
up
through
the
lightening
water
blew
the
salt
water
out
of
my
head
and
swam
slowly
and
steadily
in
to
shore
After
I
was
dressed
and
had
paid
for
the
bath-cabin
I
walked
back
to
the
hotel
The
bicycle-racers
had
left
several
copies
of
L'Auto
around
and
I
gathered
them
up
in
the
reading-room
and
took
them
out
and
sat
in
an
easy
chair
in
the
sun
to
read
about
and
catch
up
on
French
sporting
life
While
I
was
sitting
there
the
concierge
came
out
with
a
blue
envelope
in
his
hand
A
telegram
for
you
sir
I
poked
my
finger
along
under
the
fold
that
was
fastened
down
spread
it
open
and
read
it
It
had
been
forwarded
from
Paris
COULD
YOU
COME
HOTEL
MONTANA
MADRID
AM
RATHER
IN
TROUBLE
BRETT
I
tipped
the
concierge
and
read
the
message
again
A
postman
was
coming
along
the
sidewalk
He
turned
in
the
hotel
He
had
a
big
moustache
and
looked
very
military
He
came
out
of
the
hotel
again
The
concierge
was
just
behind
him
Here
's
another
telegram
for
you
sir
Thank
you
I
said
I
opened
it
It
was
forwarded
from
Pamplona
COULD
YOU
COME
HOTEL
MONTANA
MADRID
AM
RATHER
IN
TROUBLE
BRETT
The
concierge
stood
there
waiting
for
another
tip
probably
What
time
is
there
a
train
for
Madrid
It
left
at
nine
this
morning
There
is
a
slow
train
at
eleven
and
the
Sud
Express
at
ten
to-night
Get
me
a
berth
on
the
Sud
Express
Do
you
want
the
money
now
Just
as
you
wish
he
said
I
will
have
it
put
on
the
bill
Do
that
Well
that
meant
San
Sebastian
all
shot
to
hell
I
suppose
vaguely
I
had
expected
something
of
the
sort
I
saw
the
concierge
standing
in
the
doorway
Bring
me
a
telegram
form
please
He
brought
it
and
I
took
out
my
fountain-pen
and
printed
LADY
ASHLEY
HOTEL
MONTANA
MADRID
ARRIVING
SUD
EXPRESS
TOMORROW
LOVE
JAKE
That
seemed
to
handle
it
That
was
it
Send
a
girl
off
with
one
man
Introduce
her
to
another
to
go
off
with
him
Now
go
and
bring
her
back
And
sign
the
wire
with
love
That
was
it
all
right
I
went
in
to
lunch
I
did
not
sleep
much
that
night
on
the
Sud
Express
In
the
morning
I
had
breakfast
in
the
dining-car
and
watched
the
rock
and
pine
country
between
Avila
and
Escorial
I
saw
the
Escorial
out
of
the
window
gray
and
long
and
cold
in
the
sun
and
did
not
give
a
damn
about
it
I
saw
Madrid
come
up
over
the
plain
a
compact
white
sky-line
on
the
top
of
a
little
cliff
away
off
across
the
sun-hardened
country
The
Norte
station
in
Madrid
is
the
end
of
the
line
All
trains
finish
there
They
do
n't
go
on
anywhere
Outside
were
cabs
and
taxis
and
a
line
of
hotel
runners
It
was
like
a
country
town
I
took
a
taxi
and
we
climbed
up
through
the
gardens
by
the
empty
palace
and
the
unfinished
church
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
on
up
until
we
were
in
the
high
hot
modern
town
The
taxi
coasted
down
a
smooth
street
to
the
Puerta
del
Sol
and
then
through
the
traffic
and
out
into
the
Carrera
San
Jeronimo
All
the
shops
had
their
awnings
down
against
the
heat
The
windows
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
were
shuttered
The
taxi
stopped
at
the
curb
I
saw
the
sign
HOTEL
MONTANA
on
the
second
floor
The
taxi-driver
carried
the
bags
in
and
left
them
by
the
elevator
I
could
not
make
the
elevator
work
so
I
walked
up
On
the
second
floor
up
was
a
cut
brass
sign
HOTEL
MONTANA
I
rang
and
no
one
came
to
the
door
I
rang
again
and
a
maid
with
a
sullen
face
opened
the
door
Is
Lady
Ashley
here
I
asked
She
looked
at
me
dully
Is
an
Englishwoman
here
She
turned
and
called
some
one
inside
A
very
fat
woman
came
to
the
door
Her
hair
was
gray
and
stiffly
oiled
in
scallops
around
her
face
She
was
short
and
commanding
Muy
buenos
I
said
Is
there
an
Englishwoman
here
I
would
like
to
see
this
English
lady
Muy
buenos
Yes
there
is
a
female
English
Certainly
you
can
see
her
if
she
wishes
to
see
you
She
wishes
to
see
me
The
chica
will
ask
her
It
is
very
hot
It
is
very
hot
in
the
summer
in
Madrid
And
how
cold
in
winter
Yes
it
is
very
cold
in
winter
Did
I
want
to
stay
myself
in
person
in
the
Hotel
Montana
Of
that
as
yet
I
was
undecided
but
it
would
give
me
pleasure
if
my
bags
were
brought
up
from
the
ground
floor
in
order
that
they
might
not
be
stolen
Nothing
was
ever
stolen
in
the
Hotel
Montana
In
other
fondas
yes
Not
here
No
The
personages
of
this
establishment
were
rigidly
selectioned
I
was
happy
to
hear
it
Nevertheless
I
would
welcome
the
upbringal
of
my
bags
The
maid
came
in
and
said
that
the
female
English
wanted
to
see
the
male
English
now
at
once
Good
I
said
You
see
It
is
as
I
said
Clearly
I
followed
the
maid
's
back
down
a
long
dark
corridor
At
the
end
she
knocked
on
a
door
Hello
said
Brett
Is
it
you
Jake
It
's
me
Come
in
Come
in
I
opened
the
door
The
maid
closed
it
after
me
Brett
was
in
bed
She
had
just
been
brushing
her
hair
and
held
the
brush
in
her
hand
The
room
was
in
that
disorder
produced
only
by
those
who
have
always
had
servants
Darling
Brett
said
I
went
over
to
the
bed
and
put
my
arms
around
her
She
kissed
me
and
while
she
kissed
me
I
could
feel
she
was
thinking
of
something
else
She
was
trembling
in
my
arms
She
felt
very
small
Darling
I
've
had
such
a
hell
of
a
time
Tell
me
about
it
Nothing
to
tell
He
only
left
yesterday
I
made
him
go
Why
did
n't
you
keep
him
I
do
n't
know
It
is
n't
the
sort
of
thing
one
does
I
do
n't
think
I
hurt
him
any
You
were
probably
damn
good
for
him
He
should
n't
be
living
with
any
one
I
realized
that
right
away
No
Oh
hell
she
said
let
's
not
talk
about
it
Let
's
never
talk
about
it
All
right
It
was
rather
a
knock
his
being
ashamed
of
me
He
was
ashamed
of
me
for
a
while
you
know
No
Oh
yes
They
ragged
him
about
me
at
the
café
I
guess
He
wanted
me
to
grow
my
hair
out
Me
with
long
hair
I
'd
look
so
like
hell
It
's
funny
He
said
it
would
make
me
more
womanly
I
'd
look
a
fright
What
happened
Oh
he
got
over
that
He
was
n't
ashamed
of
me
long
What
was
it
about
being
in
trouble
I
did
n't
know
whether
I
could
make
him
go
and
I
did
n't
have
a
sou
to
go
away
and
leave
him
He
tried
to
give
me
a
lot
of
money
you
know
I
told
him
I
had
scads
of
it
He
knew
that
was
a
lie
I
could
n't
take
his
money
you
know
No
Oh
let
's
not
talk
about
it
There
were
some
funny
things
though
Do
give
me
a
cigarette
I
lit
the
cigarette
He
learned
his
English
as
a
waiter
in
Gib
Yes
He
wanted
to
marry
me
finally
Really
Of
course
I
ca
n't
even
marry
Mike
Maybe
he
thought
that
would
make
him
Lord
Ashley
No
It
was
n't
that
He
really
wanted
to
marry
me
So
I
could
n't
go
away
from
him
he
said
He
wanted
to
make
it
sure
I
could
never
go
away
from
him
After
I
'd
gotten
more
womanly
of
course
You
ought
to
feel
set
up
I
do
I
'm
all
right
again
He
's
wiped
out
that
damned
Cohn
Good
You
know
I
'd
have
lived
with
him
if
I
had
n't
seen
it
was
bad
for
him
We
got
along
damned
well
Outside
of
your
personal
appearance
Oh
he
'd
have
gotten
used
to
that
She
put
out
the
cigarette
I
'm
thirty-four
you
know
I
'm
not
going
to
be
one
of
these
bitches
that
ruins
children
No
I
'm
not
going
to
be
that
way
I
feel
rather
good
you
know
I
feel
rather
set
up
Good
She
looked
away
I
thought
she
was
looking
for
another
cigarette
Then
I
saw
she
was
crying
I
could
feel
her
crying
Shaking
and
crying
She
would
n't
look
up
I
put
my
arms
around
her
Do
n't
let
's
ever
talk
about
it
Please
do
n't
let
's
ever
talk
about
it
Dear
Brett
I
'm
going
back
to
Mike
I
could
feel
her
crying
as
I
held
her
close
He
's
so
damned
nice
and
he
's
so
awful
He
's
my
sort
of
thing
She
would
not
look
up
I
stroked
her
hair
I
could
feel
her
shaking
I
wo
n't
be
one
of
those
bitches
she
said
But
oh
Jake
please
let
's
never
talk
about
it
We
left
the
Hotel
Montana
The
woman
who
ran
the
hotel
would
not
let
me
pay
the
bill
The
bill
had
been
paid
Oh
well
Let
it
go
Brett
said
It
does
n't
matter
now
We
rode
in
a
taxi
down
to
the
Palace
Hotel
left
the
bags
arranged
for
berths
on
the
Sud
Express
for
the
night
and
went
into
the
bar
of
the
hotel
for
a
cocktail
We
sat
on
high
stools
at
the
bar
while
the
barman
shook
the
Martinis
in
a
large
nickelled
shaker
It
's
funny
what
a
wonderful
gentility
you
get
in
the
bar
of
a
big
hotel
I
said
Barmen
and
jockeys
are
the
only
people
who
are
polite
any
more
No
matter
how
vulgar
a
hotel
is
the
bar
is
always
nice
It
's
odd
Bartenders
have
always
been
fine
You
know
Brett
said
it
's
quite
true
He
is
only
nineteen
Is
n't
it
amazing
We
touched
the
two
glasses
as
they
stood
side
by
side
on
the
bar
They
were
coldly
beaded
Outside
the
curtained
window
was
the
summer
heat
of
Madrid
I
like
an
olive
in
a
Martini
I
said
to
the
barman
Right
you
are
sir
There
you
are
Thanks
I
should
have
asked
you
know
The
barman
went
far
enough
up
the
bar
so
that
he
would
not
hear
our
conversation
Brett
had
sipped
from
the
Martini
as
it
stood
on
the
wood
Then
she
picked
it
up
Her
hand
was
steady
enough
to
lift
it
after
that
first
sip
It
's
good
Is
n't
it
a
nice
bar
They
're
all
nice
bars
You
know
I
did
n't
believe
it
at
first
He
was
born
in
1905
I
was
in
school
in
Paris
then
Think
of
that
Anything
you
want
me
to
think
about
it
Do
n't
be
an
ass
Would
you
buy
a
lady
a
drink
We
'll
have
two
more
Martinis
As
they
were
before
sir
They
were
very
good
Brett
smiled
at
him
Thank
you
ma'am
Well
bung-o
Brett
said
Bung-o
You
know
Brett
said
he
'd
only
been
with
two
women
before
He
never
cared
about
anything
but
bull-fighting
He
's
got
plenty
of
time
I
do
n't
know
He
thinks
it
was
me
Not
the
show
in
general
Well
it
was
you
Yes
It
was
me
I
thought
you
were
n't
going
to
ever
talk
about
it
How
can
I
help
it
You
'll
lose
it
if
you
talk
about
it
I
just
talk
around
it
You
know
I
feel
rather
damned
good
Jake
You
should
You
know
it
makes
one
feel
rather
good
deciding
not
to
be
a
bitch
Yes
It
's
sort
of
what
we
have
instead
of
God
Some
people
have
God
I
said
Quite
a
lot
He
never
worked
very
well
with
me
Should
we
have
another
Martini
The
barman
shook
up
two
more
Martinis
and
poured
them
out
into
fresh
glasses
Where
will
we
have
lunch
I
asked
Brett
The
bar
was
cool
You
could
feel
the
heat
outside
through
the
window
Here
asked
Brett
It
's
rotten
here
in
the
hotel
Do
you
know
a
place
called
Botin
's
I
asked
the
barman
Yes
sir
Would
you
like
to
have
me
write
out
the
address
Thank
you
We
lunched
up-stairs
at
Botin
's
It
is
one
of
the
best
restaurants
in
the
world
We
had
roast
young
suckling
pig
and
drank
rioja
alta
Brett
did
not
eat
much
She
never
ate
much
I
ate
a
very
big
meal
and
drank
three
bottles
of
rioja
alta
How
do
you
feel
Jake
Brett
asked
My
God
what
a
meal
you
've
eaten
I
feel
fine
Do
you
want
a
dessert
Lord
no
Brett
was
smoking
You
like
to
eat
do
n't
you
she
said
Yes
I
said
I
like
to
do
a
lot
of
things
What
do
you
like
to
do
Oh
I
said
I
like
to
do
a
lot
of
things
Do
n't
you
want
a
dessert
You
asked
me
that
once
Brett
said
Yes
I
said
So
I
did
Let
's
have
another
bottle
of
rioja
alta
It
's
very
good
You
have
n't
drunk
much
of
it
I
said
I
have
You
have
n't
seen
Let
's
get
two
bottles
I
said
The
bottles
came
I
poured
a
little
in
my
glass
then
a
glass
for
Brett
then
filled
my
glass
We
touched
glasses
Bung-o
Brett
said
I
drank
my
glass
and
poured
out
another
Brett
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
Do
n't
get
drunk
Jake
she
said
You
do
n't
have
to
How
do
you
know
Do
n't
she
said
You
'll
be
all
right
I
'm
not
getting
drunk
I
said
I
'm
just
drinking
a
little
wine
I
like
to
drink
wine
Do
n't
get
drunk
she
said
Jake
do
n't
get
drunk
Want
to
go
for
a
ride
I
said
Want
to
ride
through
the
town
Right
Brett
said
I
have
n't
seen
Madrid
I
should
see
Madrid
I
'll
finish
this
I
said
Down-stairs
we
came
out
through
the
first-floor
dining-room
to
the
street
A
waiter
went
for
a
taxi
It
was
hot
and
bright
Up
the
street
was
a
little
square
with
trees
and
grass
where
there
were
taxis
parked
A
taxi
came
up
the
street
the
waiter
hanging
out
at
the
side
I
tipped
him
and
told
the
driver
where
to
drive
and
got
in
beside
Brett
The
driver
started
up
the
street
I
settled
back
Brett
moved
close
to
me
We
sat
close
against
each
other
I
put
my
arm
around
her
and
she
rested
against
me
comfortably
It
was
very
hot
and
bright
and
the
houses
looked
sharply
white
We
turned
out
onto
the
Gran
Via
Oh
Jake
Brett
said
we
could
have
had
such
a
damned
good
time
together
Ahead
was
a
mounted
policeman
in
khaki
directing
traffic
He
raised
his
baton
The
car
slowed
suddenly
pressing
Brett
against
me
Yes
I
said
Is
n't
it
pretty
to
think
so
