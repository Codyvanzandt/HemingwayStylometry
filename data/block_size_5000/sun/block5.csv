n't
come
it
's
a
cinch
they
wo
n't
get
in
to-night
I
was
sorry
as
soon
as
I
opened
my
mouth
But
I
had
to
call
him
He
's
all
right
I
guess
but
where
does
he
get
this
inside
stuff
Mike
and
Brett
fixed
it
up
with
us
about
coming
down
here
I
saw
Cohn
coming
over
across
the
square
Here
he
comes
Well
let
him
not
get
superior
and
Jewish
The
barber
shop
's
closed
Cohn
said
It
's
not
open
till
four
We
had
coffee
at
the
Iruña
sitting
in
comfortable
wicker
chairs
looking
out
from
the
cool
of
the
arcade
at
the
big
square
After
a
while
Bill
went
to
write
some
letters
and
Cohn
went
over
to
the
barber-shop
It
was
still
closed
so
he
decided
to
go
up
to
the
hotel
and
get
a
bath
and
I
sat
out
in
front
of
the
café
and
then
went
for
a
walk
in
the
town
It
was
very
hot
but
I
kept
on
the
shady
side
of
the
streets
and
went
through
the
market
and
had
a
good
time
seeing
the
town
again
I
went
to
the
Ayuntamiento
and
found
the
old
gentleman
who
subscribes
for
the
bull-fight
tickets
for
me
every
year
and
he
had
gotten
the
money
I
sent
him
from
Paris
and
renewed
my
subscriptions
so
that
was
all
set
He
was
the
archivist
and
all
the
archives
of
the
town
were
in
his
office
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
story
Anyway
his
office
had
a
green
baize
door
and
a
big
wooden
door
and
when
I
went
out
I
left
him
sitting
among
the
archives
that
covered
all
the
walls
and
I
shut
both
the
doors
and
as
I
went
out
of
the
building
into
the
street
the
porter
stopped
me
to
brush
off
my
coat
You
must
have
been
in
a
motor-car
he
said
The
back
of
the
collar
and
the
upper
part
of
the
shoulders
were
gray
with
dust
From
Bayonne
Well
well
he
said
I
knew
you
were
in
a
motor-car
from
the
way
the
dust
was
So
I
gave
him
two
copper
coins
At
the
end
of
the
street
I
saw
the
cathedral
and
walked
up
toward
it
The
first
time
I
ever
saw
it
I
thought
the
façade
was
ugly
but
I
liked
it
now
I
went
inside
It
was
dim
and
dark
and
the
pillars
went
high
up
and
there
were
people
praying
and
it
smelt
of
incense
and
there
were
some
wonderful
big
windows
I
knelt
and
started
to
pray
and
prayed
for
everybody
I
thought
of
Brett
and
Mike
and
Bill
and
Robert
Cohn
and
myself
and
all
the
bull-fighters
separately
for
the
ones
I
liked
and
lumping
all
the
rest
then
I
prayed
for
myself
again
and
while
I
was
praying
for
myself
I
found
I
was
getting
sleepy
so
I
prayed
that
the
bull-fights
would
be
good
and
that
it
would
be
a
fine
fiesta
and
that
we
would
get
some
fishing
I
wondered
if
there
was
anything
else
I
might
pray
for
and
I
thought
I
would
like
to
have
some
money
so
I
prayed
that
I
would
make
a
lot
of
money
and
then
I
started
to
think
how
I
would
make
it
and
thinking
of
making
money
reminded
me
of
the
count
and
I
started
wondering
about
where
he
was
and
regretting
I
had
n't
seen
him
since
that
night
in
Montmartre
and
about
something
funny
Brett
told
me
about
him
and
as
all
the
time
I
was
kneeling
with
my
forehead
on
the
wood
in
front
of
me
and
was
thinking
of
myself
as
praying
I
was
a
little
ashamed
and
regretted
that
I
was
such
a
rotten
Catholic
but
realized
there
was
nothing
I
could
do
about
it
at
least
for
a
while
and
maybe
never
but
that
anyway
it
was
a
grand
religion
and
I
only
wished
I
felt
religious
and
maybe
I
would
the
next
time
and
then
I
was
out
in
the
hot
sun
on
the
steps
of
the
cathedral
and
the
forefingers
and
the
thumb
of
my
right
hand
were
still
damp
and
I
felt
them
dry
in
the
sun
The
sunlight
was
hot
and
hard
and
I
crossed
over
beside
some
buildings
and
walked
back
along
side-streets
to
the
hotel
At
dinner
that
night
we
found
that
Robert
Cohn
had
taken
a
bath
had
had
a
shave
and
a
haircut
and
a
shampoo
and
something
put
on
his
hair
afterward
to
make
it
stay
down
He
was
nervous
and
I
did
not
try
to
help
him
any
The
train
was
due
in
at
nine
o'clock
from
San
Sebastian
and
if
Brett
and
Mike
were
coming
they
would
be
on
it
At
twenty
minutes
to
nine
we
were
not
half
through
dinner
Robert
Cohn
got
up
from
the
table
and
said
he
would
go
to
the
station
I
said
I
would
go
with
him
just
to
devil
him
Bill
said
he
would
be
damned
if
he
would
leave
his
dinner
I
said
we
would
be
right
back
We
walked
to
the
station
I
was
enjoying
Cohn
's
nervousness
I
hoped
Brett
would
be
on
the
train
At
the
station
the
train
was
late
and
we
sat
on
a
baggage-truck
and
waited
outside
in
the
dark
I
have
never
seen
a
man
in
civil
life
as
nervous
as
Robert
Cohn
nor
as
eager
I
was
enjoying
it
It
was
lousy
to
enjoy
it
but
I
felt
lousy
Cohn
had
a
wonderful
quality
of
bringing
out
the
worst
in
anybody
After
a
while
we
heard
the
train-whistle
way
off
below
on
the
other
side
of
the
plateau
and
then
we
saw
the
headlight
coming
up
the
hill
We
went
inside
the
station
and
stood
with
a
crowd
of
people
just
back
of
the
gates
and
the
train
came
in
and
stopped
and
everybody
started
coming
out
through
the
gates
They
were
not
in
the
crowd
We
waited
till
everybody
had
gone
through
and
out
of
the
station
and
gotten
into
buses
or
taken
cabs
or
were
walking
with
their
friends
or
relatives
through
the
dark
into
the
town
I
knew
they
would
n't
come
Robert
said
We
were
going
back
to
the
hotel
I
thought
they
might
I
said
Bill
was
eating
fruit
when
we
came
in
and
finishing
a
bottle
of
wine
Did
n't
come
eh
No
Do
you
mind
if
I
give
you
that
hundred
pesetas
in
the
morning
Cohn
Bill
asked
I
have
n't
changed
any
money
here
yet
Oh
forget
about
it
Robert
Cohn
said
Let
's
bet
on
something
else
Can
you
bet
on
bull-fights
You
could
Bill
said
but
you
do
n't
need
to
It
would
be
like
betting
on
the
war
I
said
You
do
n't
need
any
economic
interest
I
'm
very
curious
to
see
them
Robert
said
Montoya
came
up
to
our
table
He
had
a
telegram
in
his
hand
It
's
for
you
He
handed
it
to
me
It
read
Stopped
night
San
Sebastian
It
's
from
them
I
said
I
put
it
in
my
pocket
Ordinarily
I
should
have
handed
it
over
They
've
stopped
over
in
San
Sebastian
I
said
Send
their
regards
to
you
Why
I
felt
that
impulse
to
devil
him
I
do
not
know
Of
course
I
do
know
I
was
blind
unforgivingly
jealous
of
what
had
happened
to
him
The
fact
that
I
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
did
not
alter
that
any
I
certainly
did
hate
him
I
do
not
think
I
ever
really
hated
him
until
he
had
that
little
spell
of
superiority
at
lunch
that
and
when
he
went
through
all
that
barbering
So
I
put
the
telegram
in
my
pocket
The
telegram
came
to
me
anyway
Well
I
said
We
ought
to
pull
out
on
the
noon
bus
for
Burguete
They
can
follow
us
if
they
get
in
to-morrow
night
There
were
only
two
trains
up
from
San
Sebastian
an
early
morning
train
and
the
one
we
had
just
met
That
sounds
like
a
good
idea
Cohn
said
The
sooner
we
get
on
the
stream
the
better
It
's
all
one
to
me
when
we
start
Bill
said
The
sooner
the
better
We
sat
in
the
Iruña
for
a
while
and
had
coffee
and
then
took
a
little
walk
out
to
the
bull-ring
and
across
the
field
and
under
the
trees
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
looked
down
at
the
river
in
the
dark
and
I
turned
in
early
Bill
and
Cohn
stayed
out
in
the
café
quite
late
I
believe
because
I
was
asleep
when
they
came
in
In
the
morning
I
bought
three
tickets
for
the
bus
to
Burguete
It
was
scheduled
to
leave
at
two
o'clock
There
was
nothing
earlier
I
was
sitting
over
at
the
Iruña
reading
the
papers
when
I
saw
Robert
Cohn
coming
across
the
square
He
came
up
to
the
table
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
wicker
chairs
This
is
a
comfortable
café
he
said
Did
you
have
a
good
night
Jake
I
slept
like
a
log
I
did
n't
sleep
very
well
Bill
and
I
were
out
late
too
Where
were
you
Here
And
after
it
shut
we
went
over
to
that
other
café
The
old
man
there
speaks
German
and
English
The
Café
Suizo
That
's
it
He
seems
like
a
nice
old
fellow
I
think
it
's
a
better
café
than
this
one
It
's
not
so
good
in
the
daytime
I
said
Too
hot
By
the
way
I
got
the
bus
tickets
I
'm
not
going
up
to-day
You
and
Bill
go
on
ahead
I
've
got
your
ticket
Give
it
to
me
I
'll
get
the
money
back
It
's
five
pesetas
Robert
Cohn
took
out
a
silver
five-peseta
piece
and
gave
it
to
me
I
ought
to
stay
he
said
You
see
I
'm
afraid
there
's
some
sort
of
misunderstanding
Why
I
said
They
may
not
come
here
for
three
or
four
days
now
if
they
start
on
parties
at
San
Sebastian
That
's
just
it
said
Robert
I
'm
afraid
they
expected
to
meet
me
at
San
Sebastian
and
that
's
why
they
stopped
over
What
makes
you
think
that
Well
I
wrote
suggesting
it
to
Brett
Why
in
hell
did
n't
you
stay
there
and
meet
them
then
I
started
to
say
but
I
stopped
I
thought
that
idea
would
come
to
him
by
itself
but
I
do
not
believe
it
ever
did
He
was
being
confidential
now
and
it
was
giving
him
pleasure
to
be
able
to
talk
with
the
understanding
that
I
knew
there
was
something
between
him
and
Brett
Well
Bill
and
I
will
go
up
right
after
lunch
I
said
I
wish
I
could
go
We
've
been
looking
forward
to
this
fishing
all
winter
He
was
being
sentimental
about
it
But
I
ought
to
stay
I
really
ought
As
soon
as
they
come
I
'll
bring
them
right
up
Let
's
find
Bill
I
want
to
go
over
to
the
barber-shop
See
you
at
lunch
I
found
Bill
up
in
his
room
He
was
shaving
Oh
yes
he
told
me
all
about
it
last
night
Bill
said
He
's
a
great
little
confider
He
said
he
had
a
date
with
Brett
at
San
Sebastian
The
lying
bastard
Oh
no
said
Bill
Do
n't
get
sore
Do
n't
get
sore
at
this
stage
of
the
trip
How
did
you
ever
happen
to
know
this
fellow
anyway
Do
n't
rub
it
in
Bill
looked
around
half-shaved
and
then
went
on
talking
into
the
mirror
while
he
lathered
his
face
Did
n't
you
send
him
with
a
letter
to
me
in
New
York
last
winter
Thank
God
I
'm
a
travelling
man
Have
n't
you
got
some
more
Jewish
friends
you
could
bring
along
He
rubbed
his
chin
with
his
thumb
looked
at
it
and
then
started
scraping
again
You
've
got
some
fine
ones
yourself
Oh
yes
I
've
got
some
darbs
But
not
alongside
of
this
Robert
Cohn
The
funny
thing
is
he
's
nice
too
I
like
him
But
he
's
just
so
awful
He
can
be
damn
nice
I
know
it
That
's
the
terrible
part
I
laughed
Yes
Go
on
and
laugh
said
Bill
You
were
n't
out
with
him
last
night
until
two
o'clock
Was
he
very
bad
Awful
What
's
all
this
about
him
and
Brett
anyway
Did
she
ever
have
anything
to
do
with
him
He
raised
his
chin
up
and
pulled
it
from
side
to
side
Sure
She
went
down
to
San
Sebastian
with
him
What
a
damn-fool
thing
to
do
Why
did
she
do
that
She
wanted
to
get
out
of
town
and
she
ca
n't
go
anywhere
alone
She
said
she
thought
it
would
be
good
for
him
What
bloody-fool
things
people
do
Why
did
n't
she
go
off
with
some
of
her
own
people
Or
you
he
slurred
that
over
or
me
Why
not
me
He
looked
at
his
face
carefully
in
the
glass
put
a
big
dab
of
lather
on
each
cheek-bone
It
's
an
honest
face
It
's
a
face
any
woman
would
be
safe
with
She
'd
never
seen
it
She
should
have
All
women
should
see
it
It
's
a
face
that
ought
to
be
thrown
on
every
screen
in
the
country
Every
woman
ought
to
be
given
a
copy
of
this
face
as
she
leaves
the
altar
Mothers
should
tell
their
daughters
about
this
face
My
son
he
pointed
the
razor
at
me
go
west
with
this
face
and
grow
up
with
the
country
He
ducked
down
to
the
bowl
rinsed
his
face
with
cold
water
put
on
some
alcohol
and
then
looked
at
himself
carefully
in
the
glass
pulling
down
his
long
upper
lip
My
God
he
said
is
n't
it
an
awful
face
He
looked
in
the
glass
And
as
for
this
Robert
Cohn
Bill
said
he
makes
me
sick
and
he
can
go
to
hell
and
I
'm
damn
glad
he
's
staying
here
so
we
wo
n't
have
him
fishing
with
us
You
're
damn
right
We
're
going
trout-fishing
We
're
going
trout-fishing
in
the
Irati
River
and
we
're
going
to
get
tight
now
at
lunch
on
the
wine
of
the
country
and
then
take
a
swell
bus
ride
Come
on
Let
's
go
over
to
the
Iruña
and
start
I
said
It
was
baking
hot
in
the
square
when
we
came
out
after
lunch
with
our
bags
and
the
rod-case
to
go
to
Burguete
People
were
on
top
of
the
bus
and
others
were
climbing
up
a
ladder
Bill
went
up
and
Robert
sat
beside
Bill
to
save
a
place
for
me
and
I
went
back
in
the
hotel
to
get
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
to
take
with
us
When
I
came
out
the
bus
was
crowded
Men
and
women
were
sitting
on
all
the
baggage
and
boxes
on
top
and
the
women
all
had
their
fans
going
in
the
sun
It
certainly
was
hot
Robert
climbed
down
and
I
fitted
into
the
place
he
had
saved
on
the
one
wooden
seat
that
ran
across
the
top
Robert
Cohn
stood
in
the
shade
of
the
arcade
waiting
for
us
start
A
Basque
with
a
big
leather
wine-bag
in
his
lap
lay
across
the
top
of
the
bus
in
front
of
our
seat
leaning
back
against
our
legs
He
offered
the
wine-skin
to
Bill
and
to
me
and
when
I
tipped
it
up
to
drink
he
imitated
the
sound
of
a
klaxon
motor-horn
so
well
and
so
suddenly
that
I
spilled
some
of
the
wine
and
everybody
laughed
He
apologized
and
made
me
take
another
drink
He
made
the
klaxon
again
a
little
later
and
it
fooled
me
the
second
time
He
was
very
good
at
it
The
Basques
liked
it
The
man
next
to
Bill
was
talking
to
him
in
Spanish
and
Bill
was
not
getting
it
so
he
offered
the
man
one
of
the
bottles
of
wine
The
man
waved
it
away
He
said
it
was
too
hot
and
he
had
drunk
too
much
at
lunch
When
Bill
offered
the
bottle
the
second
time
he
took
a
long
drink
and
then
the
bottle
went
all
over
that
part
of
the
bus
Every
one
took
a
drink
very
politely
and
then
they
made
us
cork
it
up
and
put
it
away
They
all
wanted
us
to
drink
from
their
leather
wine-bottles
They
were
peasants
going
up
into
the
hills
Finally
after
a
couple
more
false
klaxons
the
bus
started
and
Robert
Cohn
waved
good-by
to
us
and
all
the
Basques
waved
good-by
to
him
As
soon
as
we
started
out
on
the
road
outside
of
town
it
was
cool
It
felt
nice
riding
high
up
and
close
under
the
trees
The
bus
went
quite
fast
and
made
a
good
breeze
and
as
we
went
out
along
the
road
with
the
dust
powdering
the
trees
and
down
the
hill
we
had
a
fine
view
back
through
the
trees
of
the
town
rising
up
from
the
bluff
above
the
river
The
Basque
lying
against
my
knees
pointed
out
the
view
with
the
neck
of
the
wine-bottle
and
winked
at
us
He
nodded
his
head
Pretty
nice
eh
These
Basques
are
swell
people
Bill
said
The
Basque
lying
against
my
legs
was
tanned
the
color
of
saddle-leather
He
wore
a
black
smock
like
all
the
rest
There
were
wrinkles
in
his
tanned
neck
He
turned
around
and
offered
his
wine-bag
to
Bill
Bill
handed
him
one
of
our
bottles
The
Basque
wagged
a
forefinger
at
him
and
handed
the
bottle
back
slapping
in
the
cork
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
He
shoved
the
wine-bag
up
Arriba
Arriba
he
said
Lift
it
up
Bill
raised
the
wine-skin
and
let
the
stream
of
wine
spurt
out
and
into
his
mouth
his
head
tipped
back
When
he
stopped
drinking
and
tipped
the
leather
bottle
down
a
few
drops
ran
down
his
chin
No
No
several
Basques
said
Not
like
that
One
snatched
the
bottle
away
from
the
owner
who
was
himself
about
to
give
a
demonstration
He
was
a
young
fellow
and
he
held
the
wine-bottle
at
full
arms
length
and
raised
it
high
up
squeezing
the
leather
bag
with
his
hand
so
the
stream
of
wine
hissed
into
his
mouth
He
held
the
bag
out
there
the
wine
making
a
flat
hard
trajectory
into
his
mouth
and
he
kept
on
swallowing
smoothly
and
regularly
Hey
the
owner
of
the
bottle
shouted
Whose
wine
is
that
The
drinker
waggled
his
little
finger
at
him
and
smiled
at
us
with
his
eyes
Then
he
bit
the
stream
off
sharp
made
a
quick
lift
with
the
wine-bag
and
lowered
it
down
to
the
owner
He
winked
at
us
The
owner
shook
the
wine-skin
sadly
We
passed
through
a
town
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
posada
and
the
driver
took
on
several
packages
Then
we
started
on
again
and
outside
the
town
the
road
commenced
to
mount
We
were
going
through
farming
country
with
rocky
hills
that
sloped
down
into
the
fields
The
grain-fields
went
up
the
hillsides
Now
as
we
went
higher
there
was
a
wind
blowing
the
grain
The
road
was
white
and
dusty
and
the
dust
rose
under
the
wheels
and
hung
in
the
air
behind
us
The
road
climbed
up
into
the
hills
and
left
the
rich
grain-fields
below
Now
there
were
only
patches
of
grain
on
the
bare
hillsides
and
on
each
side
of
the
water-courses
We
turned
sharply
out
to
the
side
of
the
road
to
give
room
to
pass
to
a
long
string
of
six
mules
following
one
after
the
other
hauling
a
high-hooded
wagon
loaded
with
freight
The
wagon
and
the
mules
were
covered
with
dust
Close
behind
was
another
string
of
mules
and
another
wagon
This
was
loaded
with
lumber
and
the
arriero
driving
the
mules
leaned
back
and
put
on
the
thick
wooden
brakes
as
we
passed
Up
here
the
country
was
quite
barren
and
the
hills
were
rocky
and
hard-baked
clay
furrowed
by
the
rain
We
came
around
a
curve
into
a
town
and
on
both
sides
opened
out
a
sudden
green
valley
A
stream
went
through
the
centre
of
the
town
and
fields
of
grapes
touched
the
houses
The
bus
stopped
in
front
of
a
posada
and
many
of
the
passengers
got
down
and
a
lot
of
the
baggage
was
unstrapped
from
the
roof
from
under
the
big
tarpaulins
and
lifted
down
Bill
and
I
got
down
and
went
into
the
posada
There
was
a
low
dark
room
with
saddles
and
harness
and
hay-forks
made
of
white
wood
and
clusters
of
canvas
rope-soled
shoes
and
hams
and
slabs
of
bacon
and
white
garlics
and
long
sausages
hanging
from
the
roof
It
was
cool
and
dusky
and
we
stood
in
front
of
a
long
wooden
counter
with
two
women
behind
it
serving
drinks
Behind
them
were
shelves
stacked
with
supplies
and
goods
We
each
had
an
aguardiente
and
paid
forty
centimes
for
the
two
drinks
I
gave
the
woman
fifty
centimes
to
make
a
tip
and
she
gave
me
back
the
copper
piece
thinking
I
had
misunderstood
the
price
Two
of
our
Basques
came
in
and
insisted
on
buying
a
drink
So
they
bought
a
drink
and
then
we
bought
a
drink
and
then
they
slapped
us
on
the
back
and
bought
another
drink
Then
we
bought
and
then
we
all
went
out
into
the
sunlight
and
the
heat
and
climbed
back
on
top
of
the
bus
There
was
plenty
of
room
now
for
every
one
to
sit
on
the
seat
and
the
Basque
who
had
been
lying
on
the
tin
roof
now
sat
between
us
The
woman
who
had
been
serving
drinks
came
out
wiping
her
hands
on
her
apron
and
talked
to
somebody
inside
the
bus
Then
the
driver
came
out
swinging
two
flat
leather
mail-pouches
and
climbed
up
and
everybody
waving
we
started
off
The
road
left
the
green
valley
at
once
and
we
were
up
in
the
hills
again
Bill
and
the
wine-bottle
Basque
were
having
a
conversation
A
man
leaned
over
from
the
other
side
of
the
seat
and
asked
in
English
You
're
Americans
Sure
I
been
there
he
said
Forty
years
ago
He
was
an
old
man
as
brown
as
the
others
with
the
stubble
of
a
white
beard
How
was
it
What
you
say
How
was
America
Oh
I
was
in
California
It
was
fine
Why
did
you
leave
What
you
say
Why
did
you
come
back
here
Oh
I
come
back
to
get
married
I
was
going
to
go
back
but
my
wife
she
do
n't
like
to
travel
Where
you
from
Kansas
City
I
been
there
he
said
I
been
in
Chicago
St
Louis
Kansas
City
Denver
Los
Angeles
Salt
Lake
City
He
named
them
carefully
How
long
were
you
over
Fifteen
years
Then
I
come
back
and
got
married
Have
a
drink
All
right
he
said
You
ca
n't
get
this
in
America
eh
There
's
plenty
if
you
can
pay
for
it
What
you
come
over
here
for
We
're
going
to
the
fiesta
at
Pamplona
You
like
the
bull-fights
Sure
Do
n't
you
Yes
he
said
I
guess
I
like
them
Then
after
a
little
Where
you
go
now
Up
to
Burguete
to
fish
Well
he
said
I
hope
you
catch
something
He
shook
hands
and
turned
around
to
the
back
seat
again
The
other
Basques
had
been
impressed
He
sat
back
comfortably
and
smiled
at
me
when
I
turned
around
to
look
at
the
country
But
the
effort
of
talking
American
seemed
to
have
tired
him
He
did
not
say
anything
after
that
The
bus
climbed
steadily
up
the
road
The
country
was
barren
and
rocks
stuck
up
through
the
clay
There
was
no
grass
beside
the
road
Looking
back
we
could
see
the
country
spread
out
below
Far
back
the
fields
were
squares
of
green
and
brown
on
the
hillsides
Making
the
horizon
were
the
brown
mountains
They
were
strangely
shaped
As
we
climbed
higher
the
horizon
kept
changing
As
the
bus
ground
slowly
up
the
road
we
could
see
other
mountains
coming
up
in
the
south
Then
the
road
came
over
the
crest
flattened
out
and
went
into
a
forest
It
was
a
forest
of
cork
oaks
and
the
sun
came
through
the
trees
in
patches
and
there
were
cattle
grazing
back
in
the
trees
We
went
through
the
forest
and
the
road
came
out
and
turned
along
a
rise
of
land
and
out
ahead
of
us
was
a
rolling
green
plain
with
dark
mountains
beyond
it
These
were
not
like
the
brown
heat-baked
mountains
we
had
left
behind
These
were
wooded
and
there
were
clouds
coming
down
from
them
The
green
plain
stretched
off
It
was
cut
by
fences
and
the
white
of
the
road
showed
through
the
trunks
of
a
double
line
of
trees
that
crossed
the
plain
toward
the
north
As
we
came
to
the
edge
of
the
rise
we
saw
the
red
roofs
and
white
houses
of
Burguete
ahead
strung
out
on
the
plain
and
away
off
on
the
shoulder
of
the
first
dark
mountain
was
the
gray
metal-sheathed
roof
of
the
monastery
of
Roncesvalles
There
's
Roncevaux
I
said
Where
Way
off
there
where
the
mountain
starts
It
's
cold
up
here
Bill
said
It
's
high
I
said
It
must
be
twelve
hundred
metres
It
's
awful
cold
Bill
said
The
bus
levelled
down
onto
the
straight
line
of
road
that
ran
to
Burguete
We
passed
a
crossroads
and
crossed
a
bridge
over
a
stream
The
houses
of
Burguete
were
along
both
sides
of
the
road
There
were
no
side-streets
We
passed
the
church
and
the
school-yard
and
the
bus
stopped
We
got
down
and
the
driver
handed
down
our
bags
and
the
rod-case
A
carabineer
in
his
cocked
hat
and
yellow
leather
cross-straps
came
up
What
's
in
there
he
pointed
to
the
rod-case
I
opened
it
and
showed
him
He
asked
to
see
our
fishing
permits
and
I
got
them
out
He
looked
at
the
date
and
then
waved
us
on
Is
that
all
right
I
asked
Yes
Of
course
We
went
up
the
street
past
the
whitewashed
stone
houses
families
sitting
in
their
doorways
watching
us
to
the
inn
The
fat
woman
who
ran
the
inn
came
out
from
the
kitchen
and
shook
hands
with
us
She
took
off
her
spectacles
wiped
them
and
put
them
on
again
It
was
cold
in
the
inn
and
the
wind
was
starting
to
blow
outside
The
woman
sent
a
girl
up-stairs
with
us
to
show
the
room
There
were
two
beds
a
washstand
a
clothes-chest
and
a
big
framed
steel-engraving
of
Nuestra
Señora
de
Roncesvalles
The
wind
was
blowing
against
the
shutters
The
room
was
on
the
north
side
of
the
inn
We
washed
put
on
sweaters
and
came
down-stairs
into
the
dining-room
It
had
a
stone
floor
low
ceiling
and
was
oak-panelled
The
shutters
were
up
and
it
was
so
cold
you
could
see
your
breath
My
God
said
Bill
It
ca
n't
be
this
cold
to-morrow
I
'm
not
going
to
wade
a
stream
in
this
weather
There
was
an
upright
piano
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
beyond
the
wooden
tables
and
Bill
went
over
and
started
to
play
I
got
to
keep
warm
he
said
I
went
out
to
find
the
woman
and
ask
her
how
much
the
room
and
board
was
She
put
her
hands
under
her
apron
and
looked
away
from
me
Twelve
pesetas
Why
we
only
paid
that
in
Pamplona
She
did
not
say
anything
just
took
off
her
glasses
and
wiped
them
on
her
apron
That
's
too
much
I
said
We
did
n't
pay
more
than
that
at
a
big
hotel
We
've
put
in
a
bathroom
Have
n't
you
got
anything
cheaper
Not
in
the
summer
Now
is
the
big
season
We
were
the
only
people
in
the
inn
Well
I
thought
it
's
only
a
few
days
Is
the
wine
included
Oh
yes
Well
I
said
It
's
all
right
I
went
back
to
Bill
He
blew
his
breath
at
me
to
show
how
cold
it
was
and
went
on
playing
I
sat
at
one
of
the
tables
and
looked
at
the
pictures
on
the
wall
There
was
one
panel
of
rabbits
dead
one
of
pheasants
also
dead
and
one
panel
of
dead
ducks
The
panels
were
all
dark
and
smoky-looking
There
was
a
cupboard
full
of
liqueur
bottles
I
looked
at
them
all
Bill
was
still
playing
How
about
a
hot
rum
punch
he
said
This
is
n't
going
to
keep
me
warm
permanently
I
went
out
and
told
the
woman
what
a
rum
punch
was
and
how
to
make
it
In
a
few
minutes
a
girl
brought
a
stone
pitcher
steaming
into
the
room
Bill
came
over
from
the
piano
and
we
drank
the
hot
punch
and
listened
to
the
wind
There
is
n't
too
much
rum
in
that
I
went
over
to
the
cupboard
and
brought
the
rum
bottle
and
poured
a
half-tumblerful
into
the
pitcher
Direct
action
said
Bill
It
beats
legislation
The
girl
came
in
and
laid
the
table
for
supper
It
blows
like
hell
up
here
Bill
said
The
girl
brought
in
a
big
bowl
of
hot
vegetable
soup
and
the
wine
We
had
fried
trout
afterward
and
some
sort
of
a
stew
and
a
big
bowl
full
of
wild
strawberries
We
did
not
lose
money
on
the
wine
and
the
girl
was
shy
but
nice
about
bringing
it
The
old
woman
looked
in
once
and
counted
the
empty
bottles
After
supper
we
went
up-stairs
and
smoked
and
read
in
bed
to
keep
warm
Once
in
the
night
I
woke
and
heard
the
wind
blowing
It
felt
good
to
be
warm
and
in
bed
When
I
woke
in
the
morning
I
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
