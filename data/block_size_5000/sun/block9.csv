up
a
flight
and
down
the
corridor
He
's
in
room
number
eight
Montoya
explained
He
's
getting
dressed
for
the
bull-fight
Montoya
knocked
on
the
door
and
opened
it
It
was
a
gloomy
room
with
a
little
light
coming
in
from
the
window
on
the
narrow
street
There
were
two
beds
separated
by
a
monastic
partition
The
electric
light
was
on
The
boy
stood
very
straight
and
unsmiling
in
his
bull-fighting
clothes
His
jacket
hung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
They
were
just
finishing
winding
his
sash
His
black
hair
shone
under
the
electric
light
He
wore
a
white
linen
shirt
and
the
sword-handler
finished
his
sash
and
stood
up
and
stepped
back
Pedro
Romero
nodded
seeming
very
far
away
and
dignified
when
we
shook
hands
Montoya
said
something
about
what
great
aficionados
we
were
and
that
we
wanted
to
wish
him
luck
Romero
listened
very
seriously
Then
he
turned
to
me
He
was
the
best-looking
boy
I
have
ever
seen
You
go
to
the
bull-fight
he
said
in
English
You
know
English
I
said
feeling
like
an
idiot
No
he
answered
and
smiled
One
of
three
men
who
had
been
sitting
on
the
beds
came
up
and
asked
us
if
we
spoke
French
Would
you
like
me
to
interpret
for
you
Is
there
anything
you
would
like
to
ask
Pedro
Romero
We
thanked
him
What
was
there
that
you
would
like
to
ask
The
boy
was
nineteen
years
old
alone
except
for
his
sword-handler
and
the
three
hangers-on
and
the
bull-fight
was
to
commence
in
twenty
minutes
We
wished
him
Mucha
suerte
shook
hands
and
went
out
He
was
standing
straight
and
handsome
and
altogether
by
himself
alone
in
the
room
with
the
hangers-on
as
we
shut
the
door
He
's
a
fine
boy
do
n't
you
think
so
Montoya
asked
He
's
a
good-looking
kid
I
said
He
looks
like
a
torero
Montoya
said
He
has
the
type
He
's
a
fine
boy
We
'll
see
how
he
is
in
the
ring
Montoya
said
We
found
the
big
leather
wine-bottle
leaning
against
the
wall
in
my
room
took
it
and
the
field-glasses
locked
the
door
and
went
down-stairs
It
was
a
good
bull-light
Bill
and
I
were
very
excited
about
Pedro
Romero
Montoya
was
sitting
about
ten
places
away
After
Romero
had
killed
his
first
bull
Montoya
caught
my
eye
and
nodded
his
head
This
was
a
real
one
There
had
not
been
a
real
one
for
a
long
time
Of
the
other
two
matadors
one
was
very
fair
and
the
other
was
passable
But
there
was
no
comparison
with
Romero
although
neither
of
his
bulls
was
much
Several
times
during
the
bull-fight
I
looked
up
at
Mike
and
Brett
and
Cohn
with
the
glasses
They
seemed
to
be
all
right
Brett
did
not
look
upset
All
three
were
leaning
forward
on
the
concrete
railing
in
front
of
them
Let
me
take
the
glasses
Bill
said
Does
Cohn
look
bored
I
asked
That
kike
Outside
the
ring
after
the
bull-fight
was
over
you
could
not
move
in
the
crowd
We
could
not
make
our
way
through
but
had
to
be
moved
with
the
whole
thing
slowly
as
a
glacier
back
to
town
We
had
that
disturbed
emotional
feeling
that
always
comes
after
a
bull-fight
and
the
feeling
of
elation
that
comes
after
a
good
bull-fight
The
fiesta
was
going
on
The
drums
pounded
and
the
pipe
music
was
shrill
and
everywhere
the
flow
of
the
crowd
was
broken
by
patches
of
dancers
The
dancers
were
in
a
crowd
so
you
did
not
see
the
intricate
play
of
the
feet
All
you
saw
was
the
heads
and
shoulders
going
up
and
down
up
and
down
Finally
we
got
out
of
the
crowd
and
made
for
the
café
The
waiter
saved
chairs
for
the
others
and
we
each
ordered
an
absinthe
and
watched
the
crowd
in
the
square
and
the
dancers
What
do
you
suppose
that
dance
is
Bill
asked
It
's
a
sort
of
jota
They
're
not
all
the
same
Bill
said
They
dance
differently
to
all
the
different
tunes
It
's
swell
dancing
In
front
of
us
on
a
clear
part
of
the
street
a
company
of
boys
were
dancing
The
steps
were
very
intricate
and
their
faces
were
intent
and
concentrated
They
all
looked
down
while
they
danced
Their
rope-soled
shoes
tapped
and
spatted
on
the
pavement
The
toes
touched
The
heels
touched
The
balls
of
the
feet
touched
Then
the
music
broke
wildly
and
the
step
was
finished
and
they
were
all
dancing
on
up
the
street
Here
come
the
gentry
Bill
said
They
were
crossing
the
street
Hello
men
I
said
Hello
gents
said
Brett
You
saved
us
seats
How
nice
I
say
Mike
said
that
Romero
what'shisname
is
somebody
Am
I
wrong
Oh
is
n't
he
lovely
Brett
said
And
those
green
trousers
Brett
never
took
her
eyes
off
them
I
say
I
must
borrow
your
glasses
to-morrow
How
did
it
go
Wonderfully
Simply
perfect
I
say
it
is
a
spectacle
How
about
the
horses
I
could
n't
help
looking
at
them
She
could
n't
take
her
eyes
off
them
Mike
said
She
's
an
extraordinary
wench
They
do
have
some
rather
awful
things
happen
to
them
Brett
said
I
could
n't
look
away
though
Did
you
feel
all
right
I
did
n't
feel
badly
at
all
Robert
Cohn
did
Mike
put
in
You
were
quite
green
Robert
The
first
horse
did
bother
me
Cohn
said
You
were
n't
bored
were
you
asked
Bill
Cohn
laughed
No
I
was
n't
bored
I
wish
you
'd
forgive
me
that
It
's
all
right
Bill
said
so
long
as
you
were
n't
bored
He
did
n't
look
bored
Mike
said
I
thought
he
was
going
to
be
sick
I
never
felt
that
bad
It
was
just
for
a
minute
I
thought
he
was
going
to
be
sick
You
were
n't
bored
were
you
Robert
Let
up
on
that
Mike
I
said
I
was
sorry
I
said
it
He
was
you
know
He
was
positively
green
Oh
shove
it
along
Michael
You
must
n't
ever
get
bored
at
your
first
bull-fight
Robert
Mike
said
It
might
make
such
a
mess
Oh
shove
it
along
Michael
Brett
said
He
said
Brett
was
a
sadist
Mike
said
Brett
's
not
a
sadist
She
's
just
a
lovely
healthy
wench
Are
you
a
sadist
Brett
I
asked
Hope
not
He
said
Brett
was
a
sadist
just
because
she
has
a
good
healthy
stomach
Wo
n't
be
healthy
long
Bill
got
Mike
started
on
something
else
than
Cohn
The
waiter
brought
the
absinthe
glasses
Did
you
really
like
it
Bill
asked
Cohn
No
I
ca
n't
say
I
liked
it
I
think
it
's
a
wonderful
show
Gad
yes
What
a
spectacle
Brett
said
I
wish
they
did
n't
have
the
horse
part
Cohn
said
They
're
not
important
Bill
said
After
a
while
you
never
notice
anything
disgusting
It
is
a
bit
strong
just
at
the
start
Brett
said
There
's
a
dreadful
moment
for
me
just
when
the
bull
starts
for
the
horse
The
bulls
were
fine
Cohn
said
They
were
very
good
Mike
said
I
want
to
sit
down
below
next
time
Brett
drank
from
her
glass
of
absinthe
She
wants
to
see
the
bull-fighters
close
by
Mike
said
They
are
something
Brett
said
That
Romero
lad
is
just
a
child
He
's
a
damned
good-looking
boy
I
said
When
we
were
up
in
his
room
I
never
saw
a
better-looking
kid
How
old
do
you
suppose
he
is
Nineteen
or
twenty
Just
imagine
it
The
bull-fight
on
the
second
day
was
much
better
than
on
the
first
Brett
sat
between
Mike
and
me
at
the
barrera
and
Bill
and
Cohn
went
up
above
Romero
was
the
whole
show
I
do
not
think
Brett
saw
any
other
bull-fighter
No
one
else
did
either
except
the
hard-shelled
technicians
It
was
all
Romero
There
were
two
other
matadors
but
they
did
not
count
I
sat
beside
Brett
and
explained
to
Brett
what
it
was
all
about
I
told
her
about
watching
the
bull
not
the
horse
when
the
bulls
charged
the
picadors
and
got
her
to
watching
the
picador
place
the
point
of
his
pic
so
that
she
saw
what
it
was
all
about
so
that
it
became
more
something
that
was
going
on
with
a
definite
end
and
less
of
a
spectacle
with
unexplained
horrors
I
had
her
watch
how
Romero
took
the
bull
away
from
a
fallen
horse
with
his
cape
and
how
he
held
him
with
the
cape
and
turned
him
smoothly
and
suavely
never
wasting
the
bull
She
saw
how
Romero
avoided
every
brusque
movement
and
saved
his
bulls
for
the
last
when
he
wanted
them
not
winded
and
discomposed
but
smoothly
worn
down
She
saw
how
close
Romero
always
worked
to
the
bull
and
I
pointed
out
to
her
the
tricks
the
other
bull-fighters
used
to
make
it
look
as
though
they
were
working
closely
She
saw
why
she
liked
Romero
's
cape-work
and
why
she
did
not
like
the
others
Romero
never
made
any
contortions
always
it
was
straight
and
pure
and
natural
in
line
The
others
twisted
themselves
like
corkscrews
their
elbows
raised
and
leaned
against
the
flanks
of
the
bull
after
his
horns
had
passed
to
give
a
faked
look
of
danger
Afterward
all
that
was
faked
turned
bad
and
gave
an
unpleasant
feeling
Romero
's
bull-fighting
gave
real
emotion
because
he
kept
the
absolute
purity
of
line
in
his
movements
and
always
quietly
and
calmly
let
the
horns
pass
him
close
each
time
He
did
not
have
to
emphasize
their
closeness
Brett
saw
how
something
that
was
beautiful
done
close
to
the
bull
was
ridiculous
if
it
were
done
a
little
way
off
I
told
her
how
since
the
death
of
Joselito
all
the
bull-fighters
had
been
developing
a
technic
that
simulated
this
appearance
of
danger
in
order
to
give
a
fake
emotional
feeling
while
the
bull-fighter
was
really
safe
Romero
had
the
old
thing
the
holding
of
his
purity
of
line
through
the
maximum
of
exposure
while
he
dominated
the
bull
by
making
him
realize
he
was
unattainable
while
he
prepared
him
for
the
killing
I
've
never
seen
him
do
an
awkward
thing
Brett
said
You
wo
n't
until
he
gets
frightened
I
said
He
'll
never
be
frightened
Mike
said
He
knows
too
damned
much
He
knew
everything
when
he
started
The
others
ca
n't
ever
learn
what
he
was
born
with
And
God
what
looks
Brett
said
I
believe
you
know
that
she
's
falling
in
love
with
this
bull-fighter
chap
Mike
said
I
would
n't
be
surprised
Be
a
good
chap
Jake
Do
n't
tell
her
anything
more
about
him
Tell
her
how
they
beat
their
old
mothers
Tell
me
what
drunks
they
are
Oh
frightful
Mike
said
Drunk
all
day
and
spend
all
their
time
beating
their
poor
old
mothers
He
looks
that
way
Brett
said
Does
n't
he
I
said
They
had
hitched
the
mules
to
the
dead
bull
and
then
the
whips
cracked
the
men
ran
and
the
mules
straining
forward
their
legs
pushing
broke
into
a
gallop
and
the
bull
one
horn
up
his
head
on
its
side
swept
a
swath
smoothly
across
the
sand
and
out
the
red
gate
This
next
is
the
last
one
Not
really
Brett
said
She
leaned
forward
on
the
barrera
Romero
waved
his
picadors
to
their
places
then
stood
his
cape
against
his
chest
looking
across
the
ring
to
where
the
bull
would
come
out
After
it
was
over
we
went
out
and
were
pressed
tight
in
the
crowd
These
bull-fights
are
hell
on
one
Brett
said
I
'm
limp
as
a
rag
Oh
you
'll
get
a
drink
Mike
said
The
next
day
Pedro
Romero
did
not
fight
It
was
Miura
bulls
and
a
very
bad
bull-fight
The
next
day
there
was
no
bull-fight
scheduled
But
all
day
and
all
night
the
fiesta
kept
on
In
the
morning
it
was
raining
A
fog
had
come
over
the
mountains
from
the
sea
You
could
not
see
the
tops
of
the
mountains
The
plateau
was
dull
and
gloomy
and
the
shapes
of
the
trees
and
the
houses
were
changed
I
walked
out
beyond
the
town
to
look
at
the
weather
The
bad
weather
was
coming
over
the
mountains
from
the
sea
The
flags
in
the
square
hung
wet
from
the
white
poles
and
the
banners
were
wet
and
hung
damp
against
the
front
of
the
houses
and
in
between
the
steady
drizzle
the
rain
came
down
and
drove
every
one
under
the
arcades
and
made
pools
of
water
in
the
square
and
the
streets
wet
and
dark
and
deserted
yet
the
fiesta
kept
up
without
any
pause
It
was
only
driven
under
cover
The
covered
seats
of
the
bull-ring
had
been
crowded
with
people
sitting
out
of
the
rain
watching
the
concourse
of
Basque
and
Navarrais
dancers
and
singers
and
afterward
the
Val
Carlos
dancers
in
their
costumes
danced
down
the
street
in
the
rain
the
drums
sounding
hollow
and
damp
and
the
chiefs
of
the
bands
riding
ahead
on
their
big
heavy-footed
horses
their
costumes
wet
the
horses
coats
wet
in
the
rain
The
crowd
was
in
the
cafés
and
the
dancers
came
in
too
and
sat
their
tight-wound
white
legs
under
the
tables
shaking
the
water
from
their
belled
caps
and
spreading
their
red
and
purple
jackets
over
the
chairs
to
dry
It
was
raining
hard
outside
I
left
the
crowd
in
the
café
and
went
over
to
the
hotel
to
get
shaved
for
dinner
I
was
shaving
in
my
room
when
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
Come
in
I
called
Montoya
walked
in
How
are
you
he
said
Fine
I
said
No
bulls
to-day
No
I
said
nothing
but
rain
Where
are
your
friends
Over
at
the
Iruña
Montoya
smiled
his
embarrassed
smile
Look
he
said
Do
you
know
the
American
ambassador
Yes
I
said
Everybody
knows
the
American
ambassador
He
's
here
in
town
now
Yes
I
said
Everybody
's
seen
them
I
've
seen
them
too
Montoya
said
He
did
n't
say
anything
I
went
on
shaving
Sit
down
I
said
Let
me
send
for
a
drink
No
I
have
to
go
I
finished
shaving
and
put
my
face
down
into
the
bowl
and
washed
it
with
cold
water
Montoya
was
standing
there
looking
more
embarrassed
Look
he
said
I
've
just
had
a
message
from
them
at
the
Grand
Hotel
that
they
want
Pedro
Romero
and
Marcial
Lalanda
to
come
over
for
coffee
to-night
after
dinner
Well
I
said
it
ca
n't
hurt
Marcial
any
Marcial
has
been
in
San
Sebastian
all
day
He
drove
over
in
a
car
this
morning
with
Marquez
I
do
n't
think
they
'll
be
back
to-night
Montoya
stood
embarrassed
He
wanted
me
to
say
something
Do
n't
give
Romero
the
message
I
said
You
think
so
Absolutely
Montoya
was
very
pleased
I
wanted
to
ask
you
because
you
were
an
American
he
said
That
's
what
I
'd
do
Look
said
Montoya
People
take
a
boy
like
that
They
do
n't
know
what
he
's
worth
They
do
n't
know
what
he
means
Any
foreigner
can
flatter
him
They
start
this
Grand
Hotel
business
and
in
one
year
they
're
through
Like
Algabeno
I
said
Yes
like
Algabeno
They
're
a
fine
lot
I
said
There
's
one
American
woman
down
here
now
that
collects
bull-fighters
I
know
They
only
want
the
young
ones
Yes
I
said
The
old
ones
get
fat
Or
crazy
like
Gallo
Well
I
said
it
's
easy
All
you
have
to
do
is
not
give
him
the
message
He
's
such
a
fine
boy
said
Montoya
He
ought
to
stay
with
his
own
people
He
should
n't
mix
in
that
stuff
Wo
n't
you
have
a
drink
I
asked
No
said
Montoya
I
have
to
go
He
went
out
I
went
down-stairs
and
out
the
door
and
took
a
walk
around
through
the
arcades
around
the
square
It
was
still
raining
I
looked
in
at
the
Iruña
for
the
gang
and
they
were
not
there
so
I
walked
on
around
the
square
and
back
to
the
hotel
They
were
eating
dinner
in
the
down-stairs
dining-room
They
were
well
ahead
of
me
and
it
was
no
use
trying
to
catch
them
Bill
was
buying
shoe-shines
for
Mike
Bootblacks
opened
the
street
door
and
each
one
Bill
called
over
and
started
to
work
on
Mike
This
is
the
eleventh
time
my
boots
have
been
polished
Mike
said
I
say
Bill
is
an
ass
The
bootblacks
had
evidently
spread
the
report
Another
came
in
Limpia
botas
he
said
to
Bill
No
said
Bill
For
this
Señor
The
bootblack
knelt
down
beside
the
one
at
work
and
started
on
Mike
's
free
shoe
that
shone
already
in
the
electric
light
Bill
's
a
yell
of
laughter
Mike
said
I
was
drinking
red
wine
and
so
far
behind
them
that
I
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
about
all
this
shoe-shining
I
looked
around
the
room
At
the
next
table
was
Pedro
Romero
He
stood
up
when
I
nodded
and
asked
me
to
come
over
and
meet
a
friend
His
table
was
beside
ours
almost
touching
I
met
the
friend
a
Madrid
bull-fight
critic
a
little
man
with
a
drawn
face
I
told
Romero
how
much
I
liked
his
work
and
he
was
very
pleased
We
talked
Spanish
and
the
critic
knew
a
little
French
I
reached
to
our
table
for
my
wine-bottle
but
the
critic
took
my
arm
Romero
laughed
Drink
here
he
said
in
English
He
was
very
bashful
about
his
English
but
he
was
really
very
pleased
with
it
and
as
we
went
on
talking
he
brought
out
words
he
was
not
sure
of
and
asked
me
about
them
He
was
anxious
to
know
the
English
for
Corrida
de
toros
the
exact
translation
Bull-fight
he
was
suspicious
of
I
explained
that
bull-fight
in
Spanish
was
the
lidia
of
a
toro
The
Spanish
word
corrida
means
in
English
the
running
of
bulls
the
French
translation
is
Course
de
taureaux
The
critic
put
that
in
There
is
no
Spanish
word
for
bull-fight
Pedro
Romero
said
he
had
learned
a
little
English
in
Gibraltar
He
was
born
in
Ronda
That
is
not
far
above
Gibraltar
He
started
bull-fighting
in
Malaga
in
the
bull-fighting
school
there
He
had
only
been
at
it
three
years
The
bull-fight
critic
joked
him
about
the
number
of
Malagueño
expressions
he
used
He
was
nineteen
years
old
he
said
His
older
brother
was
with
him
as
a
banderillero
but
he
did
not
live
in
this
hotel
He
lived
in
a
smaller
hotel
with
the
other
people
who
worked
for
Romero
He
asked
me
how
many
times
I
had
seen
him
in
the
ring
I
told
him
only
three
It
was
really
only
two
but
I
did
not
want
to
explain
after
I
had
made
the
mistake
Where
did
you
see
me
the
other
time
In
Madrid
Yes
I
lied
I
had
read
the
accounts
of
his
two
appearances
in
Madrid
in
the
bull-fight
papers
so
I
was
all
right
The
first
or
the
second
time
The
first
I
was
very
bad
he
said
The
second
time
I
was
better
You
remember
He
turned
to
the
critic
He
was
not
at
all
embarrassed
He
talked
of
his
work
as
something
altogether
apart
from
himself
There
was
nothing
conceited
or
braggartly
about
him
I
like
it
very
much
that
you
like
my
work
he
said
But
you
have
n't
seen
it
yet
To-morrow
if
I
get
a
good
bull
I
will
try
and
show
it
to
you
When
he
said
this
he
smiled
anxious
that
neither
the
bull-fight
critic
nor
I
would
think
he
was
boasting
I
am
anxious
to
see
it
the
critic
said
I
would
like
to
be
convinced
He
does
n't
like
my
work
much
Romero
turned
to
me
He
was
serious
The
critic
explained
that
he
liked
it
very
much
but
that
so
far
it
had
been
incomplete
Wait
till
to-morrow
if
a
good
one
comes
out
Have
you
seen
the
bulls
for
to-morrow
the
critic
asked
me
Yes
I
saw
them
unloaded
Pedro
Romero
leaned
forward
What
did
you
think
of
them
Very
nice
I
said
About
twenty-six
arrobas
Very
short
horns
Have
n't
you
seen
them
Oh
yes
said
Romero
They
wo
n't
weigh
twenty-six
arrobas
said
the
critic
No
said
Romero
They
've
got
bananas
for
horns
the
critic
said
You
call
them
bananas
asked
Romero
He
turned
to
me
and
smiled
You
would
n't
call
them
bananas
No
I
said
They
're
horns
all
right
They
're
very
short
said
Pedro
Romero
Very
very
short
Still
they
are
n't
bananas
I
say
Jake
Brett
called
from
the
next
table
you
have
deserted
us
Just
temporarily
I
said
We
're
talking
bulls
You
are
superior
Tell
him
that
bulls
have
no
balls
Mike
shouted
He
was
drunk
Romero
looked
at
me
inquiringly
Drunk
I
said
Borracho
Muy
borracho
You
might
introduce
your
friends
Brett
said
She
had
not
stopped
looking
at
Pedro
Romero
I
asked
them
if
they
would
like
to
have
coffee
with
us
They
both
stood
up
Romero
's
face
was
very
brown
He
had
very
nice
manners
I
introduced
them
all
around
and
they
started
to
sit
down
but
there
was
not
enough
room
so
we
all
moved
over
to
the
big
table
by
the
wall
to
have
coffee
Mike
ordered
a
bottle
of
Fundador
and
glasses
for
everybody
There
was
a
lot
of
drunken
talking
Tell
him
I
think
writing
is
lousy
Bill
said
Go
on
tell
him
Tell
him
I
'm
ashamed
of
being
a
writer
Pedro
Romero
was
sitting
beside
Brett
and
listening
to
her
Go
on
Tell
him
Bill
said
Romero
looked
up
smiling
This
gentleman
I
said
is
a
writer
Romero
was
impressed
This
other
one
too
I
said
pointing
at
Cohn
He
looks
like
Villalta
Romero
said
looking
at
Bill
Rafael
does
n't
he
look
like
Villalta
I
ca
n't
see
it
the
critic
said
Really
Romero
said
in
Spanish
He
looks
a
lot
like
Villalta
What
does
the
drunken
one
do
Nothing
Is
that
why
he
drinks
No
He
's
waiting
to
marry
this
lady
Tell
him
bulls
have
no
balls
Mike
shouted
very
drunk
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
What
does
he
say
He
's
drunk
Jake
Mike
called
Tell
him
bulls
have
no
balls
You
understand
I
said
Yes
I
was
sure
he
did
n't
so
it
was
all
right
Tell
him
Brett
wants
to
see
him
put
on
those
green
pants
Pipe
down
Mike
Tell
him
Brett
is
dying
to
know
how
he
can
get
into
those
pants
Pipe
down
During
this
Romero
was
fingering
his
glass
and
talking
with
Brett
Brett
was
talking
French
and
he
was
talking
Spanish
and
a
little
English
and
laughing
Bill
was
filling
the
glasses
Tell
him
Brett
wants
to
come
into
Oh
pipe
down
Mike
for
Christ
's
sake
Romero
looked
up
smiling
Pipe
down
I
know
that
he
said
Just
then
Montoya
came
into
the
room
He
started
to
smile
at
me
then
he
saw
Pedro
Romero
with
a
big
glass
of
cognac
in
his
hand
sitting
laughing
between
me
and
a
woman
with
bare
shoulders
at
a
table
full
of
drunks
He
did
not
even
nod
Montoya
went
out
of
the
room
Mike
was
on
his
feet
proposing
a
toast
Let
's
all
drink
to
he
began
Pedro
Romero
I
said
Everybody
stood
up
Romero
took
it
very
seriously
and
we
touched
glasses
and
drank
it
down
I
rushing
it
a
little
because
Mike
was
trying
to
make
it
clear
that
that
was
not
at
all
what
he
was
going
to
drink
to
But
it
went
off
all
right
and
Pedro
Romero
shook
hands
with
every
one
and
he
and
the
critic
went
out
together
My
God
he
's
a
lovely
boy
Brett
said
And
how
I
would
love
to
see
him
get
into
those
clothes
He
must
use
a
shoe-horn
I
started
to
tell
him
Mike
began
And
Jake
kept
interrupting
me
Why
do
you
interrupt
me
Do
you
think
you
talk
Spanish
better
than
I
do
Oh
shut
up
Mike
Nobody
interrupted
you
No
I
'd
like
to
get
this
settled
He
turned
away
from
me
Do
you
think
you
amount
to
something
Cohn
Do
you
think
you
belong
here
among
us
People
who
are
out
to
have
a
good
time
For
God
's
sake
do
n't
be
so
noisy
Cohn
Oh
cut
it
out
Mike
Cohn
said
Do
you
think
Brett
wants
you
here
Do
you
think
you
add
to
the
party
Why
do
n't
you
say
something
I
said
all
I
had
to
say
the
other
night
Mike
I
'm
not
one
of
you
literary
chaps
Mike
stood
shakily
and
leaned
against
the
table
I
'm
not
clever
But
I
do
know
when
I
'm
not
wanted
Why
do
n't
you
see
when
you
're
not
wanted
Cohn
Go
away
Go
away
for
God
's
sake
Take
that
sad
Jewish
face
away
Do
n't
you
think
I
'm
right
He
looked
at
us
Sure
I
said
Let
's
all
go
over
to
the
Iruña
No
Do
n't
you
think
I
'm
right
I
love
that
woman
Oh
do
n't
start
that
again
Do
shove
it
along
Michael
Brett
said
Do
n't
you
think
I
'm
right
Jake
Cohn
still
sat
at
the
table
His
face
had
the
sallow
yellow
look
it
got
when
he
was
insulted
but
somehow
he
seemed
to
be
enjoying
it
The
childish
drunken
heroics
of
it
It
was
his
affair
with
a
lady
of
title
Jake
Mike
said
He
was
almost
crying
You
know
I
'm
right
Listen
you
He
turned
to
Cohn
Go
away
Go
away
now
But
I
wo
n't
go
Mike
said
Cohn
Then
I
'll
make
you
Mike
started
toward
him
around
the
table
Cohn
stood
up
and
took
off
his
glasses
He
stood
waiting
his
face
sallow
his
hands
fairly
low
proudly
and
firmly
waiting
for
the
assault
ready
to
do
battle
for
his
lady
love
I
grabbed
Mike
Come
on
to
the
café
I
said
You
ca
n't
hit
him
here
in
the
hotel
Good
said
Mike
Good
idea
We
started
off
I
looked
back
as
Mike
stumbled
up
the
stairs
and
saw
Cohn
putting
his
glasses
on
again
Bill
was
sitting
at
the
table
pouring
another
glass
of
Fundador
Brett
was
sitting
looking
straight
ahead
at
nothing
Outside
on
the
square
it
had
stopped
raining
and
the
moon
was
trying
to
get
through
the
clouds
There
was
a
wind
blowing
The
military
band
was
playing
and
the
crowd
was
massed
on
the
far
side
of
the
square
where
the
fireworks
specialist
and
his
son
were
trying
to
send
up
fire
balloons
A
balloon
would
start
up
jerkily
on
a
great
bias
and
be
torn
by
the
wind
or
blown
against
the
houses
of
the
square
Some
fell
into
the
crowd
The
magnesium
flared
and
the
fireworks
exploded
and
chased
about
in
the
crowd
There
was
no
one
dancing
in
the
square
The
gravel
was
too
wet
Brett
came
out
with
Bill
and
joined
us
We
stood
in
the
crowd
and
watched
Don
Manuel
Orquito
the
fireworks
king
standing
on
a
little
platform
carefully
starting
the
balloons
with
sticks
standing
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
to
launch
the
balloons
off
into
the
wind
The
wind
brought
them
all
down
and
Don
Manuel
Orquito
's
face
was
sweaty
in
the
light
of
his
complicated
fireworks
that
fell
into
the
crowd
and
charged
and
chased
sputtering
and
cracking
between
the
legs
of
the
people
The
people
shouted
as
each
new
luminous
paper
bubble
careened
caught
fire
and
fell
They
're
razzing
Don
Manuel
Bill
said
How
do
you
know
he
's
Don
Manuel
Brett
said
His
name
's
on
the
programme
Don
Manuel
Orquito
the
pirotecnico
of
esta
ciudad
Globos
illuminados
Mike
said
A
collection
of
globos
illuminados
That
's
what
the
paper
said
The
wind
blew
the
band
music
away
I
say
I
wish
one
would
go
up
Brett
said
That
Don
Manuel
chap
is
furious
He
's
probably
worked
for
weeks
fixing
them
to
go
off
spelling
out
'Hail
to
San
Fermin
Bill
said
Globos
illuminados
Mike
said
A
bunch
of
bloody
globos
illuminados
Come
on
said
Brett
We
ca
n't
stand
here
Her
ladyship
wants
a
drink
Mike
said
How
you
know
things
Brett
said
Inside
the
café
was
crowded
and
very
noisy
No
one
noticed
us
come
in
We
could
not
find
a
table
There
was
a
great
noise
going
on
Come
on
let
's
get
out
of
here
Bill
said
Outside
the
paseo
was
going
in
under
the
arcade
There
were
some
English
and
Americans
from
Biarritz
in
sport
clothes
scattered
at
the
tables
Some
of
the
women
stared
at
the
people
going
by
with
lorgnons
We
had
acquired
at
some
time
a
friend
of
Bill
's
from
Biarritz
She
was
staying
with
another
girl
at
the
Grand
Hotel
The
other
girl
had
a
headache
and
had
gone
to
bed
Here
's
the
pub
Mike
said
It
was
the
Bar
Milano
a
small
tough
bar
where
you
could
get
food
and
where
they
danced
in
the
back
room
We
all
sat
down
at
a
table
and
ordered
a
bottle
of
Fundador
The
bar
was
not
full
There
was
nothing
going
on
This
is
a
hell
of
a
place
Bill
said
It
's
too
early
Let
's
take
the
bottle
and
come
back
later
Bill
said
I
do
n't
want
to
sit
here
on
a
night
like
this
Let
's
go
and
look
at
the
English
Mike
said
I
love
to
look
at
the
English
They
're
awful
Bill
said
Where
did
they
all
come
from
They
come
from
Biarritz
Mike
said
They
come
to
see
the
last
day
of
the
quaint
