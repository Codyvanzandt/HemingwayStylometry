Jake
he
said
Hel-lo
Hel-lo
How
are
you
old
lad
You
look
very
fit
Mike
Oh
I
am
I
'm
frightfully
fit
I
've
done
nothing
but
walk
Walk
all
day
long
One
drink
a
day
with
my
mother
at
tea
Bill
had
gone
into
the
bar
He
was
standing
talking
with
Brett
who
was
sitting
on
a
high
stool
her
legs
crossed
She
had
no
stockings
on
It
's
good
to
see
you
Jake
Michael
said
I
'm
a
little
tight
you
know
Amazing
is
n't
it
Did
you
see
my
nose
There
was
a
patch
of
dried
blood
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
An
old
lady
's
bags
did
that
Mike
said
I
reached
up
to
help
her
with
them
and
they
fell
on
me
Brett
gestured
at
him
from
the
bar
with
her
cigarette-holder
and
wrinkled
the
corners
of
her
eyes
An
old
lady
said
Mike
Her
bags
fell
on
me
Let
's
go
in
and
see
Brett
I
say
she
is
a
piece
You
are
a
lovely
lady
Brett
Where
did
you
get
that
hat
Chap
bought
it
for
me
Do
n't
you
like
it
It
's
a
dreadful
hat
Do
get
a
good
hat
Oh
we
've
so
much
money
now
Brett
said
I
say
have
n't
you
met
Bill
yet
You
are
a
lovely
host
Jake
She
turned
to
Mike
This
is
Bill
Gorton
This
drunkard
is
Mike
Campbell
Mr
Campbell
is
an
undischarged
bankrupt
Are
n't
I
though
You
know
I
met
my
ex-partner
yesterday
in
London
Chap
who
did
me
in
What
did
he
say
Bought
me
a
drink
I
thought
I
might
as
well
take
it
I
say
Brett
you
are
a
lovely
piece
Do
n't
you
think
she
's
beautiful
Beautiful
With
this
nose
It
's
a
lovely
nose
Go
on
point
it
at
me
Is
n't
she
a
lovely
piece
Could
n't
we
have
kept
the
man
in
Scotland
I
say
Brett
let
's
turn
in
early
Do
n't
be
indecent
Michael
Remember
there
are
ladies
at
this
bar
Is
n't
she
a
lovely
piece
Do
n't
you
think
so
Jake
There
's
a
fight
to-night
Bill
said
Like
to
go
Fight
said
Mike
Who
's
fighting
Ledoux
and
somebody
He
's
very
good
Ledoux
Mike
said
I
'd
like
to
see
it
rather
he
was
making
an
effort
to
pull
himself
together
but
I
ca
n't
go
I
had
a
date
with
this
thing
here
I
say
Brett
do
get
a
new
hat
Brett
pulled
the
felt
hat
down
far
over
one
eye
and
smiled
out
from
under
it
You
two
run
along
to
the
fight
I
'll
have
to
be
taking
Mr
Campbell
home
directly
I
'm
not
tight
Mike
said
Perhaps
just
a
little
I
say
Brett
you
are
a
lovely
piece
Go
on
to
the
fight
Brett
said
Mr
Campbell
's
getting
difficult
What
are
these
outbursts
of
affection
Michael
I
say
you
are
a
lovely
piece
We
said
good
night
I
'm
sorry
I
ca
n't
go
Mike
said
Brett
laughed
I
looked
back
from
the
door
Mike
had
one
hand
on
the
bar
and
was
leaning
toward
Brett
talking
Brett
was
looking
at
him
quite
coolly
but
the
corners
of
her
eyes
were
smiling
Outside
on
the
pavement
I
said
Do
you
want
to
go
to
the
fight
Sure
said
Bill
If
we
do
n't
have
to
walk
Mike
was
pretty
excited
about
his
girl
friend
I
said
in
the
taxi
Well
said
Bill
You
ca
n't
blame
him
such
a
hell
of
a
lot
The
Ledoux-Kid
Francis
fight
was
the
night
of
the
20th
of
June
It
was
a
good
fight
The
morning
after
the
fight
I
had
a
letter
from
Robert
Cohn
written
from
Hendaye
He
was
having
a
very
quiet
time
he
said
bathing
playing
some
golf
and
much
bridge
Hendaye
had
a
splendid
beach
but
he
was
anxious
to
start
on
the
fishing-trip
When
would
I
be
down
If
I
would
buy
him
a
double-tapered
line
he
would
pay
me
when
I
came
down
That
same
morning
I
wrote
Cohn
from
the
office
that
Bill
and
I
would
leave
Paris
on
the
25th
unless
I
wired
him
otherwise
and
would
meet
him
at
Bayonne
where
we
could
get
a
bus
over
the
mountains
to
Pamplona
The
same
evening
about
seven
o'clock
I
stopped
in
at
the
Select
to
see
Michael
and
Brett
They
were
not
there
and
I
went
over
to
the
Dingo
They
were
inside
sitting
at
the
bar
Hello
darling
Brett
put
out
her
hand
Hello
Jake
Mike
said
I
understand
I
was
tight
last
night
Were
n't
you
though
Brett
said
Disgraceful
business
Look
said
Mike
when
do
you
go
down
to
Spain
Would
you
mind
if
we
came
down
with
you
It
would
be
grand
You
would
n't
mind
really
I
've
been
at
Pamplona
you
know
Brett
's
mad
to
go
You
're
sure
we
would
n't
just
be
a
bloody
nuisance
Do
n't
talk
like
a
fool
I
'm
a
little
tight
you
know
I
would
n't
ask
you
like
this
if
I
were
n't
You
're
sure
you
do
n't
mind
Oh
shut
up
Michael
Brett
said
How
can
the
man
say
he
'd
mind
now
I
'll
ask
him
later
But
you
do
n't
mind
do
you
Do
n't
ask
that
again
unless
you
want
to
make
me
sore
Bill
and
I
go
down
on
the
morning
of
the
25th
By
the
way
where
is
Bill
Brett
asked
He
's
out
at
Chantilly
dining
with
some
people
He
's
a
good
chap
Splendid
chap
said
Mike
He
is
you
know
You
do
n't
remember
him
Brett
said
I
do
Remember
him
perfectly
Look
Jake
we
'll
come
down
the
night
of
the
25th
Brett
ca
n't
get
up
in
the
morning
Indeed
not
If
our
money
comes
and
you
're
sure
you
do
n't
mind
It
will
come
all
right
I
'll
see
to
that
Tell
me
what
tackle
to
send
for
Get
two
or
three
rods
with
reels
and
lines
and
some
flies
I
wo
n't
fish
Brett
put
in
Get
two
rods
then
and
Bill
wo
n't
have
to
buy
one
Right
said
Mike
I
'll
send
a
wire
to
the
keeper
Wo
n't
it
be
splendid
Brett
said
Spain
We
will
have
fun
The
25th
When
is
that
Saturday
We
will
have
to
get
ready
I
say
said
Mike
I
'm
going
to
the
barber
's
I
must
bathe
said
Brett
Walk
up
to
the
hotel
with
me
Jake
Be
a
good
chap
We
have
got
the
loveliest
hotel
Mike
said
I
think
it
's
a
brothel
We
left
our
bags
here
at
the
Dingo
when
we
got
in
and
they
asked
us
at
this
hotel
if
we
wanted
a
room
for
the
afternoon
only
Seemed
frightfully
pleased
we
were
going
to
stay
all
night
I
believe
it
's
a
brothel
Mike
said
And
I
should
know
Oh
shut
it
and
go
and
get
your
hair
cut
Mike
went
out
Brett
and
I
sat
on
at
the
bar
Have
another
Might
I
needed
that
Brett
said
We
walked
up
the
Rue
Delambre
I
have
n't
seen
you
since
I
've
been
back
Brett
said
No
How
are
you
Jake
Fine
Brett
looked
at
me
I
say
she
said
is
Robert
Cohn
going
on
this
trip
Yes
Why
Do
n't
you
think
it
will
be
a
bit
rough
on
him
Why
should
it
Who
did
you
think
I
went
down
to
San
Sebastian
with
Congratulations
I
said
We
walked
along
What
did
you
say
that
for
I
do
n't
know
What
would
you
like
me
to
say
We
walked
along
and
turned
a
corner
He
behaved
rather
well
too
He
gets
a
little
dull
Does
he
I
rather
thought
it
would
be
good
for
him
You
might
take
up
social
service
Do
n't
be
nasty
I
wo
n't
Did
n't
you
really
know
No
I
said
I
guess
I
did
n't
think
about
it
Do
you
think
it
will
be
too
rough
on
him
That
's
up
to
him
I
said
Tell
him
you
're
coming
He
can
always
not
come
I
'll
write
him
and
give
him
a
chance
to
pull
out
of
it
I
did
not
see
Brett
again
until
the
night
of
the
24th
of
June
Did
you
hear
from
Cohn
Rather
He
's
keen
about
it
My
God
I
thought
it
was
rather
odd
myself
Says
he
ca
n't
wait
to
see
me
Does
he
think
you
're
coming
alone
No
I
told
him
we
were
all
coming
down
together
Michael
and
all
He
's
wonderful
Is
n't
he
They
expected
their
money
the
next
day
We
arranged
to
meet
at
Pamplona
They
would
go
directly
to
San
Sebastian
and
take
the
train
from
there
We
would
all
meet
at
the
Montoya
in
Pamplona
If
they
did
not
turn
up
on
Monday
at
the
latest
we
would
go
on
ahead
up
to
Burguete
in
the
mountains
to
start
fishing
There
was
a
bus
to
Burguete
I
wrote
out
an
itinerary
so
they
could
follow
us
Bill
and
I
took
the
morning
train
from
the
Gare
d'Orsay
It
was
a
lovely
day
not
too
hot
and
the
country
was
beautiful
from
the
start
We
went
back
into
the
diner
and
had
breakfast
Leaving
the
dining-car
I
asked
the
conductor
for
tickets
for
the
first
service
Nothing
until
the
fifth
What
's
this
There
were
never
more
than
two
servings
of
lunch
on
that
train
and
always
plenty
of
places
for
both
of
them
They
're
all
reserved
the
dining-car
conductor
said
There
will
be
a
fifth
service
at
three-thirty
This
is
serious
I
said
to
Bill
Give
him
ten
francs
Here
I
said
We
want
to
eat
in
the
first
service
The
conductor
put
the
ten
francs
in
his
pocket
Thank
you
he
said
I
would
advise
you
gentlemen
to
get
some
sandwiches
All
the
places
for
the
first
four
services
were
reserved
at
the
office
of
the
company
You
'll
go
a
long
way
brother
Bill
said
to
him
in
English
I
suppose
if
I
'd
given
you
five
francs
you
would
have
advised
us
to
jump
off
the
train
Comment
Go
to
hell
said
Bill
Get
the
sandwiches
made
and
a
bottle
of
wine
You
tell
him
Jake
And
send
it
up
to
the
next
car
I
described
where
we
were
In
our
compartment
were
a
man
and
his
wife
and
their
young
son
I
suppose
you
're
Americans
are
n't
you
the
man
asked
Having
a
good
trip
Wonderful
said
Bill
That
's
what
you
want
to
do
Travel
while
you
're
young
Mother
and
I
always
wanted
to
get
over
but
we
had
to
wait
a
while
You
could
have
come
over
ten
years
ago
if
you
'd
wanted
to
the
wife
said
What
you
always
said
was
'See
America
first
I
will
say
we
've
seen
a
good
deal
take
it
one
way
and
another
Say
there
's
plenty
of
Americans
on
this
train
the
husband
said
They
've
got
seven
cars
of
them
from
Dayton
Ohio
They
've
been
on
a
pilgrimage
to
Rome
and
now
they
're
going
down
to
Biarritz
and
Lourdes
So
that
's
what
they
are
Pilgrims
Goddam
Puritans
Bill
said
What
part
of
the
States
you
boys
from
Kansas
City
I
said
He
's
from
Chicago
You
both
going
to
Biarritz
No
We
're
going
fishing
in
Spain
Well
I
never
cared
for
it
myself
There
's
plenty
that
do
out
where
I
come
from
though
We
got
some
of
the
best
fishing
in
the
State
of
Montana
I
've
been
out
with
the
boys
but
I
never
cared
for
it
any
Mighty
little
fishing
you
did
on
them
trips
his
wife
said
He
winked
at
us
You
know
how
the
ladies
are
If
there
's
a
jug
goes
along
or
a
case
of
beer
they
think
it
's
hell
and
damnation
That
's
the
way
men
are
his
wife
said
to
us
She
smoothed
her
comfortable
lap
I
voted
against
prohibition
to
please
him
and
because
I
like
a
little
beer
in
the
house
and
then
he
talks
that
way
It
's
a
wonder
they
ever
find
any
one
to
marry
them
Say
said
Bill
do
you
know
that
gang
of
Pilgrim
Fathers
have
cornered
the
dining-car
until
half
past
three
this
afternoon
How
do
you
mean
They
ca
n't
do
a
thing
like
that
You
try
and
get
seats
Well
mother
it
looks
as
though
we
better
go
back
and
get
another
breakfast
She
stood
up
and
straightened
her
dress
Will
you
boys
keep
an
eye
on
our
things
Come
on
Hubert
They
all
three
went
up
to
the
wagon
restaurant
A
little
while
after
they
were
gone
a
steward
went
through
announcing
the
first
service
and
pilgrims
with
their
priests
commenced
filing
down
the
corridor
Our
friend
and
his
family
did
not
come
back
A
waiter
passed
in
the
corridor
with
our
sandwiches
and
the
bottle
of
Chablis
and
we
called
him
in
You
're
going
to
work
to-day
I
said
He
nodded
his
head
They
start
now
at
ten-thirty
When
do
we
eat
Huh
When
do
I
eat
He
left
two
glasses
for
the
bottle
and
we
paid
him
for
the
sandwiches
and
tipped
him
I
'll
get
the
plates
he
said
or
bring
them
with
you
We
ate
the
sandwiches
and
drank
the
Chablis
and
watched
the
country
out
of
the
window
The
grain
was
just
beginning
to
ripen
and
the
fields
were
full
of
poppies
The
pastureland
was
green
and
there
were
fine
trees
and
sometimes
big
rivers
and
chateaux
off
in
the
trees
At
Tours
we
got
off
and
bought
another
bottle
of
wine
and
when
we
got
back
in
the
compartment
the
gentleman
from
Montana
and
his
wife
and
his
son
Hubert
were
sitting
comfortably
Is
there
good
swimming
in
Biarritz
asked
Hubert
That
boy
's
just
crazy
till
he
can
get
in
the
water
his
mother
said
It
's
pretty
hard
on
youngsters
travelling
There
's
good
swimming
I
said
But
it
's
dangerous
when
it
's
rough
Did
you
get
a
meal
Bill
asked
We
sure
did
We
set
right
there
when
they
started
to
come
in
and
they
must
have
just
thought
we
were
in
the
party
One
of
the
waiters
said
something
to
us
in
French
and
then
they
just
sent
three
of
them
back
They
thought
we
were
snappers
all
right
the
man
said
It
certainly
shows
you
the
power
of
the
Catholic
Church
It
's
a
pity
you
boys
ai
n't
Catholics
You
could
get
a
meal
then
all
right
I
am
I
said
That
's
what
makes
me
so
sore
Finally
at
a
quarter
past
four
we
had
lunch
Bill
had
been
rather
difficult
at
the
last
He
buttonholed
a
priest
who
was
coming
back
with
one
of
the
returning
streams
of
pilgrims
When
do
us
Protestants
get
a
chance
to
eat
father
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
Have
n't
you
got
tickets
It
's
enough
to
make
a
man
join
the
Klan
Bill
said
The
priest
looked
back
at
him
Inside
the
dining-car
the
waiters
served
the
fifth
successive
table
d'hôte
meal
The
waiter
who
served
us
was
soaked
through
His
white
jacket
was
purple
under
the
arms
He
must
drink
a
lot
of
wine
Or
wear
purple
undershirts
Let
's
ask
him
No
He
's
too
tired
The
train
stopped
for
half
an
hour
at
Bordeaux
and
we
went
out
through
the
station
for
a
little
walk
There
was
not
time
to
get
in
to
the
town
Afterward
we
passed
through
the
Landes
and
watched
the
sun
set
There
were
wide
fire-gaps
cut
through
the
pines
and
you
could
look
up
them
like
avenues
and
see
wooded
hills
way
off
About
seven-thirty
we
had
dinner
and
watched
the
country
through
the
open
window
in
the
diner
It
was
all
sandy
pine
country
full
of
heather
There
were
little
clearings
with
houses
in
them
and
once
in
a
while
we
passed
a
sawmill
It
got
dark
and
we
could
feel
the
country
hot
and
sandy
and
dark
outside
of
the
window
and
about
nine
o'clock
we
got
into
Bayonne
The
man
and
his
wife
and
Hubert
all
shook
hands
with
us
They
were
going
on
to
LaNegresse
to
change
for
Biarritz
Well
I
hope
you
have
lots
of
luck
he
said
Be
careful
about
those
bull-fights
Maybe
we
'll
see
you
at
Biarritz
Hubert
said
We
got
off
with
our
bags
and
rod-cases
and
passed
through
the
dark
station
and
out
to
the
lights
and
the
line
of
cabs
and
hotel
buses
There
standing
with
the
hotel
runners
was
Robert
Cohn
He
did
not
see
us
at
first
Then
he
started
forward
Hello
Jake
Have
a
good
trip
Fine
I
said
This
is
Bill
Gorton
How
are
you
Come
on
said
Robert
I
've
got
a
cab
He
was
a
little
near-sighted
I
had
never
noticed
it
before
He
was
looking
at
Bill
trying
to
make
him
out
He
was
shy
too
We
'll
go
up
to
my
hotel
It
's
all
right
It
's
quite
nice
We
got
into
the
cab
and
the
cabman
put
the
bags
up
on
the
seat
beside
him
and
climbed
up
and
cracked
his
whip
and
we
drove
over
the
dark
bridge
and
into
the
town
I
'm
awfully
glad
to
meet
you
Robert
said
to
Bill
I
've
heard
so
much
about
you
from
Jake
and
I
've
read
your
books
Did
you
get
my
line
Jake
The
cab
stopped
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
we
all
got
out
and
went
in
It
was
a
nice
hotel
and
the
people
at
the
desk
were
very
cheerful
and
we
each
had
a
good
small
room
In
the
morning
it
was
bright
and
they
were
sprinkling
the
streets
of
the
town
and
we
all
had
breakfast
in
a
café
Bayonne
is
a
nice
town
It
is
like
a
very
clean
Spanish
town
and
it
is
on
a
big
river
Already
so
early
in
the
morning
it
was
very
hot
on
the
bridge
across
the
river
We
walked
out
on
the
bridge
and
then
took
a
walk
through
the
town
I
was
not
at
all
sure
Mike
's
rods
would
come
from
Scotland
in
time
so
we
hunted
a
tackle
store
and
finally
bought
a
rod
for
Bill
up-stairs
over
a
drygoods
store
The
man
who
sold
the
tackle
was
out
and
we
had
to
wait
for
him
to
come
back
Finally
he
came
in
and
we
bought
a
pretty
good
rod
cheap
and
two
landing-nets
We
went
out
into
the
street
again
and
took
a
look
at
the
cathedral
Cohn
made
some
remark
about
it
being
a
very
good
example
of
something
or
other
I
forget
what
It
seemed
like
a
nice
cathedral
nice
and
dim
like
Spanish
churches
Then
we
went
up
past
the
old
fort
and
out
to
the
local
Syndicat
d'Initiative
office
where
the
bus
was
supposed
to
start
from
There
they
told
us
the
bus
service
did
not
start
until
the
1st
of
July
We
found
out
at
the
tourist
office
what
we
ought
to
pay
for
a
motor-car
to
Pamplona
and
hired
one
at
a
big
garage
just
around
the
corner
from
the
Municipal
Theatre
for
four
hundred
francs
The
car
was
to
pick
us
up
at
the
hotel
in
forty
minutes
and
we
stopped
at
the
café
on
the
square
where
we
had
eaten
breakfast
and
had
a
beer
It
was
hot
but
the
town
had
a
cool
fresh
early-morning
smell
and
it
was
pleasant
sitting
in
the
café
A
breeze
started
to
blow
and
you
could
feel
that
the
air
came
from
the
sea
There
were
pigeons
out
in
the
square
and
the
houses
were
a
yellow
sun-baked
color
and
I
did
not
want
to
leave
the
café
But
we
had
to
go
to
the
hotel
to
get
our
bags
packed
and
pay
the
bill
We
paid
for
the
beers
we
matched
and
I
think
Cohn
paid
and
went
up
to
the
hotel
It
was
only
sixteen
francs
apiece
for
Bill
and
me
with
ten
per
cent
added
for
the
service
and
we
had
the
bags
sent
down
and
waited
for
Robert
Cohn
While
we
were
waiting
I
saw
a
cockroach
on
the
parquet
floor
that
must
have
been
at
least
three
inches
long
I
pointed
him
out
to
Bill
and
then
put
my
shoe
on
him
We
agreed
he
must
have
just
come
in
from
the
garden
It
was
really
an
awfully
clean
hotel
Cohn
came
down
finally
and
we
all
went
out
to
the
car
It
was
a
big
closed
car
with
a
driver
in
a
white
duster
with
blue
collar
and
cuffs
and
we
had
him
put
the
back
of
the
car
down
He
piled
in
the
bags
and
we
started
off
up
the
street
and
out
of
the
town
We
passed
some
lovely
gardens
and
had
a
good
look
back
at
the
town
and
then
we
were
out
in
the
country
green
and
rolling
and
the
road
climbing
all
the
time
We
passed
lots
of
Basques
with
oxen
or
cattle
hauling
carts
along
the
road
and
nice
farmhouses
low
roofs
and
all
white-plastered
In
the
Basque
country
the
land
all
looks
very
rich
and
green
and
the
houses
and
villages
look
well-off
and
clean
Every
village
had
a
pelota
court
and
on
some
of
them
kids
were
playing
in
the
hot
sun
There
were
signs
on
the
walls
of
the
churches
saying
it
was
forbidden
to
play
pelota
against
them
and
the
houses
in
the
villages
had
red
tiled
roofs
and
then
the
road
turned
off
and
commenced
to
climb
and
we
were
going
way
up
close
along
a
hillside
with
a
valley
below
and
hills
stretched
off
back
toward
the
sea
You
could
n't
see
the
sea
It
was
too
far
away
You
could
see
only
hills
and
more
hills
and
you
knew
where
the
sea
was
We
crossed
the
Spanish
frontier
There
was
a
little
stream
and
a
bridge
and
Spanish
carabineers
with
patent-leather
Bonaparte
hats
and
short
guns
on
their
backs
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
fat
Frenchmen
in
kepis
and
mustaches
They
only
opened
one
bag
and
took
the
passports
in
and
looked
at
them
There
was
a
general
store
and
inn
on
each
side
of
the
line
The
chauffeur
had
to
go
in
and
fill
out
some
papers
about
the
car
and
we
got
out
and
went
over
to
the
stream
to
see
if
there
were
any
trout
Bill
tried
to
talk
some
Spanish
to
one
of
the
carabineers
but
it
did
not
go
very
well
Robert
Cohn
asked
pointing
with
his
finger
if
there
were
any
trout
in
the
stream
and
the
carabineer
said
yes
but
not
many
I
asked
him
if
he
ever
fished
and
he
said
no
that
he
did
n't
care
for
it
Just
then
an
old
man
with
long
sunburned
hair
and
beard
and
clothes
that
looked
as
though
they
were
made
of
gunny-sacking
came
striding
up
to
the
bridge
He
was
carrying
a
long
staff
and
he
had
a
kid
slung
on
his
back
tied
by
the
four
legs
the
head
hanging
down
The
carabineer
waved
him
back
with
his
sword
The
man
turned
without
saying
anything
and
started
back
up
the
white
road
into
Spain
What
's
the
matter
with
the
old
one
I
asked
He
has
n't
got
any
passport
I
offered
the
guard
a
cigarette
He
took
it
and
thanked
me
What
will
he
do
I
asked
The
guard
spat
in
the
dust
Oh
he
'll
just
wade
across
the
stream
Do
you
have
much
smuggling
Oh
he
said
they
go
through
The
chauffeur
came
out
folding
up
the
papers
and
putting
them
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
We
all
got
in
the
car
and
it
started
up
the
white
dusty
road
into
Spain
For
a
while
the
country
was
much
as
it
had
been
then
climbing
all
the
time
we
crossed
the
top
of
a
Col
the
road
winding
back
and
forth
on
itself
and
then
it
was
really
Spain
There
were
long
brown
mountains
and
a
few
pines
and
far-off
forests
of
beech-trees
on
some
of
the
mountainsides
The
road
went
along
the
summit
of
the
Col
and
then
dropped
down
and
the
driver
had
to
honk
and
slow
up
and
turn
out
to
avoid
running
into
two
donkeys
that
were
sleeping
in
the
road
We
came
down
out
of
the
mountains
and
through
an
oak
forest
and
there
were
white
cattle
grazing
in
the
forest
Down
below
there
were
grassy
plains
and
clear
streams
and
then
we
crossed
a
stream
and
went
through
a
gloomy
little
village
and
started
to
climb
again
We
climbed
up
and
up
and
crossed
another
high
Col
and
turned
along
it
and
the
road
ran
down
to
the
right
and
we
saw
a
whole
new
range
of
mountains
off
to
the
south
all
brown
and
baked-looking
and
furrowed
in
strange
shapes
After
a
while
we
came
out
of
the
mountains
and
there
were
trees
along
both
sides
of
the
road
and
a
stream
and
ripe
fields
of
grain
and
the
road
went
on
very
white
and
straight
ahead
and
then
lifted
to
a
little
rise
and
off
on
the
left
was
a
hill
with
an
old
castle
with
buildings
close
around
it
and
a
field
of
grain
going
right
up
to
the
walls
and
shifting
in
the
wind
I
was
up
in
front
with
the
driver
and
I
turned
around
Robert
Cohn
was
asleep
but
Bill
looked
and
nodded
his
head
Then
we
crossed
a
wide
plain
and
there
was
a
big
river
off
on
the
right
shining
in
the
sun
from
between
the
line
of
trees
and
away
off
you
could
see
the
plateau
of
Pamplona
rising
out
of
the
plain
and
the
walls
of
the
city
and
the
great
brown
cathedral
and
the
broken
skyline
of
the
other
churches
In
back
of
the
plateau
were
the
mountains
and
every
way
you
looked
there
were
other
mountains
and
ahead
the
road
stretched
out
white
across
the
plain
going
toward
Pamplona
We
came
into
the
town
on
the
other
side
of
the
plateau
the
road
slanting
up
steeply
and
dustily
with
shade-trees
on
both
sides
and
then
levelling
out
through
the
new
part
of
town
they
are
building
up
outside
the
old
walls
We
passed
the
bull-ring
high
and
white
and
concrete-looking
in
the
sun
and
then
came
into
the
big
square
by
a
side
street
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
Hotel
Montoya
The
driver
helped
us
down
with
the
bags
There
was
a
crowd
of
kids
watching
the
car
and
the
square
was
hot
and
the
trees
were
green
and
the
flags
hung
on
their
staffs
and
it
was
good
to
get
out
of
the
sun
and
under
the
shade
of
the
arcade
that
runs
all
the
way
around
the
square
Montoya
was
glad
to
see
us
and
shook
hands
and
gave
us
good
rooms
looking
out
on
the
square
and
then
we
washed
and
cleaned
up
and
went
down-stairs
in
the
dining-room
for
lunch
The
driver
stayed
for
lunch
too
and
afterward
we
paid
him
and
he
started
back
to
Bayonne
There
are
two
dining-rooms
in
the
Montoya
One
is
up-stairs
on
the
second
floor
and
looks
out
on
the
square
The
other
is
down
one
floor
below
the
level
of
the
square
and
has
a
door
that
opens
on
the
back
street
that
the
bulls
pass
along
when
they
run
through
the
streets
early
in
the
morning
on
their
way
to
the
ring
It
is
always
cool
in
the
down-stairs
dining-room
and
we
had
a
very
good
lunch
The
first
meal
in
Spain
was
always
a
shock
with
the
hors
d'oeuvres
an
egg
course
two
meat
courses
vegetables
salad
and
dessert
and
fruit
You
have
to
drink
plenty
of
wine
to
get
it
all
down
Robert
Cohn
tried
to
say
he
did
not
want
any
of
the
second
meat
course
but
we
would
not
interpret
for
him
and
so
the
waitress
brought
him
something
else
as
a
replacement
a
plate
of
cold
meats
I
think
Cohn
had
been
rather
nervous
ever
since
we
had
met
at
Bayonne
He
did
not
know
whether
we
knew
Brett
had
been
with
him
at
San
Sebastian
and
it
made
him
rather
awkward
Well
I
said
Brett
and
Mike
ought
to
get
in
to-night
I
'm
not
sure
they
'll
come
Cohn
said
Why
not
Bill
said
Of
course
they
'll
come
They
're
always
late
I
said
I
rather
think
they
're
not
coming
Robert
Cohn
said
He
said
it
with
an
air
of
superior
knowledge
that
irritated
both
of
us
I
'll
bet
you
fifty
pesetas
they
're
here
to-night
Bill
said
He
always
bets
when
he
is
angered
and
so
he
usually
bets
foolishly
I
'll
take
it
Cohn
said
Good
You
remember
it
Jake
Fifty
pesetas
I
'll
remember
it
myself
Bill
said
I
saw
he
was
angry
and
wanted
to
smooth
him
down
It
's
a
sure
thing
they
'll
come
I
said
But
maybe
not
to-night
Want
to
call
it
off
Cohn
asked
No
Why
should
I
Make
it
a
hundred
if
you
like
All
right
I
'll
take
that
That
's
enough
I
said
Or
you
'll
have
to
make
a
book
and
give
me
some
of
it
I
'm
satisfied
Cohn
said
He
smiled
You
'll
probably
win
it
back
at
bridge
anyway
You
have
n't
got
it
yet
Bill
said
We
went
out
to
walk
around
under
the
arcade
to
the
Café
Iruña
for
coffee
Cohn
said
he
was
going
over
and
get
a
shave
Say
Bill
said
to
me
have
I
got
any
chance
on
that
bet
You
've
got
a
rotten
chance
They
've
never
been
on
time
anywhere
If
their
money
does
