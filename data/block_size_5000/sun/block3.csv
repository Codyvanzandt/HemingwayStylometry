drink
and
one
for
myself
There
was
a
ring
at
the
bell-pull
I
went
to
the
door
and
there
was
the
count
Behind
him
was
the
chauffeur
carrying
a
basket
of
champagne
Where
should
I
have
him
put
it
sir
asked
the
count
In
the
kitchen
Brett
said
Put
it
in
there
Henry
the
count
motioned
Now
go
down
and
get
the
ice
He
stood
looking
after
the
basket
inside
the
kitchen
door
I
think
you
'll
find
that
's
very
good
wine
he
said
I
know
we
do
n't
get
much
of
a
chance
to
judge
good
wine
in
the
States
now
but
I
got
this
from
a
friend
of
mine
that
's
in
the
business
Oh
you
always
have
some
one
in
the
trade
Brett
said
This
fellow
raises
the
grapes
He
's
got
thousands
of
acres
of
them
What
's
his
name
asked
Brett
Veuve
Cliquot
No
said
the
count
Mumms
He
's
a
baron
Is
n't
it
wonderful
said
Brett
We
all
have
titles
Why
have
n't
you
a
title
Jake
I
assure
you
sir
the
count
put
his
hand
on
my
arm
It
never
does
a
man
any
good
Most
of
the
time
it
costs
you
money
Oh
I
do
n't
know
It
's
damned
useful
sometimes
Brett
said
I
've
never
known
it
to
do
me
any
good
You
have
n't
used
it
properly
I
've
had
hell
's
own
amount
of
credit
on
mine
Do
sit
down
count
I
said
Let
me
take
that
stick
The
count
was
looking
at
Brett
across
the
table
under
the
gas-light
She
was
smoking
a
cigarette
and
flicking
the
ashes
on
the
rug
She
saw
me
notice
it
I
say
Jake
I
do
n't
want
to
ruin
your
rugs
Ca
n't
you
give
a
chap
an
ash-tray
I
found
some
ash-trays
and
spread
them
around
The
chauffeur
came
up
with
a
bucket
full
of
salted
ice
Put
two
bottles
in
it
Henry
the
count
called
Anything
else
sir
No
Wait
down
in
the
car
He
turned
to
Brett
and
to
me
We
'll
want
to
ride
out
to
the
Bois
for
dinner
If
you
like
Brett
said
I
could
n't
eat
a
thing
I
always
like
a
good
meal
said
the
count
Should
I
bring
the
wine
in
sir
asked
the
chauffeur
Yes
Bring
it
in
Henry
said
the
count
He
took
out
a
heavy
pigskin
cigar-case
and
offered
it
to
me
Like
to
try
a
real
American
cigar
Thanks
I
said
I
'll
finish
the
cigarette
He
cut
off
the
end
of
his
cigar
with
a
gold
cutter
he
wore
on
one
end
of
his
watch-chain
I
like
a
cigar
to
really
draw
said
the
count
Half
the
cigars
you
smoke
do
n't
draw
He
lit
the
cigar
puffed
at
it
looking
across
the
table
at
Brett
And
when
you
're
divorced
Lady
Ashley
then
you
wo
n't
have
a
title
No
What
a
pity
No
said
the
count
You
do
n't
need
a
title
You
got
class
all
over
you
Thanks
Awfully
decent
of
you
I
'm
not
joking
you
the
count
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
You
got
the
most
class
of
anybody
I
ever
seen
You
got
it
That
's
all
Nice
of
you
said
Brett
Mummy
would
be
pleased
Could
n't
you
write
it
out
and
I
'll
send
it
in
a
letter
to
her
I
'd
tell
her
too
said
the
count
I
'm
not
joking
you
I
never
joke
people
Joke
people
and
you
make
enemies
That
's
what
I
always
say
You
're
right
Brett
said
You
're
terribly
right
I
always
joke
people
and
I
have
n't
a
friend
in
the
world
Except
Jake
here
You
do
n't
joke
him
That
's
it
Do
you
now
asked
the
count
Do
you
joke
him
Brett
looked
at
me
and
wrinkled
up
the
corners
of
her
eyes
No
she
said
I
would
n't
joke
him
See
said
the
count
You
do
n't
joke
him
This
is
a
hell
of
a
dull
talk
Brett
said
How
about
some
of
that
champagne
The
count
reached
down
and
twirled
the
bottles
in
the
shiny
bucket
It
is
n't
cold
yet
You
're
always
drinking
my
dear
Why
do
n't
you
just
talk
I
've
talked
too
ruddy
much
I
've
talked
myself
all
out
to
Jake
I
should
like
to
hear
you
really
talk
my
dear
When
you
talk
to
me
you
never
finish
your
sentences
at
all
Leave
'em
for
you
to
finish
Let
any
one
finish
them
as
they
like
It
is
a
very
interesting
system
the
count
reached
down
and
gave
the
bottles
a
twirl
Still
I
would
like
to
hear
you
talk
some
time
Is
n't
he
a
fool
Brett
asked
Now
the
count
brought
up
a
bottle
I
think
this
is
cool
I
brought
a
towel
and
he
wiped
the
bottle
dry
and
held
it
up
I
like
to
drink
champagne
from
magnums
The
wine
is
better
but
it
would
have
been
too
hard
to
cool
He
held
the
bottle
looking
at
it
I
put
out
the
glasses
I
say
You
might
open
it
Brett
suggested
Yes
my
dear
Now
I
'll
open
it
It
was
amazing
champagne
I
say
that
is
wine
Brett
held
up
her
glass
We
ought
to
toast
something
'Here
's
to
royalty
This
wine
is
too
good
for
toast-drinking
my
dear
You
do
n't
want
to
mix
emotions
up
with
a
wine
like
that
You
lose
the
taste
Brett
's
glass
was
empty
You
ought
to
write
a
book
on
wines
count
I
said
Mr
Barnes
answered
the
count
all
I
want
out
of
wines
is
to
enjoy
them
Let
's
enjoy
a
little
more
of
this
Brett
pushed
her
glass
forward
The
count
poured
very
carefully
There
my
dear
Now
you
enjoy
that
slowly
and
then
you
can
get
drunk
Drunk
Drunk
My
dear
you
are
charming
when
you
are
drunk
Listen
to
the
man
Mr
Barnes
the
count
poured
my
glass
full
She
is
the
only
lady
I
have
ever
known
who
was
as
charming
when
she
was
drunk
as
when
she
was
sober
You
have
n't
been
around
much
have
you
Yes
my
dear
I
have
been
around
very
much
I
have
been
around
a
very
great
deal
Drink
your
wine
said
Brett
We
've
all
been
around
I
dare
say
Jake
here
has
seen
as
much
as
you
have
My
dear
I
am
sure
Mr
Barnes
has
seen
a
lot
Do
n't
think
I
do
n't
think
so
sir
I
have
seen
a
lot
too
Of
course
you
have
my
dear
Brett
said
I
was
only
ragging
I
have
been
in
seven
wars
and
four
revolutions
the
count
said
Soldiering
Brett
asked
Sometimes
my
dear
And
I
have
got
arrow
wounds
Have
you
ever
seen
arrow
wounds
Let
's
have
a
look
at
them
The
count
stood
up
unbuttoned
his
vest
and
opened
his
shirt
He
pulled
up
the
undershirt
onto
his
chest
and
stood
his
chest
black
and
big
stomach
muscles
bulging
under
the
light
You
see
them
Below
the
line
where
his
ribs
stopped
were
two
raised
white
welts
See
on
the
back
where
they
come
out
Above
the
small
of
the
back
were
the
same
two
scars
raised
as
thick
as
a
finger
I
say
Those
are
something
Clean
through
The
count
was
tucking
in
his
shirt
Where
did
you
get
those
I
asked
In
Abyssinia
When
I
was
twenty-one
years
old
What
were
you
doing
asked
Brett
Were
you
in
the
army
I
was
on
a
business
trip
my
dear
I
told
you
he
was
one
of
us
Did
n't
I
Brett
turned
to
me
I
love
you
count
You
're
a
darling
You
make
me
very
happy
my
dear
But
it
is
n't
true
Do
n't
be
an
ass
You
see
Mr
Barnes
it
is
because
I
have
lived
very
much
that
now
I
can
enjoy
everything
so
well
Do
n't
you
find
it
like
that
Yes
Absolutely
I
know
said
the
count
That
is
the
secret
You
must
get
to
know
the
values
Does
n't
anything
ever
happen
to
your
values
Brett
asked
No
Not
any
more
Never
fall
in
love
Always
said
the
count
I
am
always
in
love
What
does
that
do
to
your
values
That
too
has
got
a
place
in
my
values
You
have
n't
any
values
You
're
dead
that
's
all
No
my
dear
You
're
not
right
I
'm
not
dead
at
all
We
drank
three
bottles
of
the
champagne
and
the
count
left
the
basket
in
my
kitchen
We
dined
at
a
restaurant
in
the
Bois
It
was
a
good
dinner
Food
had
an
excellent
place
in
the
count
's
values
So
did
wine
The
count
was
in
fine
form
during
the
meal
So
was
Brett
It
was
a
good
party
Where
would
you
like
to
go
asked
the
count
after
dinner
We
were
the
only
people
left
in
the
restaurant
The
two
waiters
were
standing
over
against
the
door
They
wanted
to
go
home
We
might
go
up
on
the
hill
Brett
said
Have
n't
we
had
a
splendid
party
The
count
was
beaming
He
was
very
happy
You
are
very
nice
people
he
said
He
was
smoking
a
cigar
again
Why
do
n't
you
get
married
you
two
We
want
to
lead
our
own
lives
I
said
We
have
our
careers
Brett
said
Come
on
Let
's
get
out
of
this
Have
another
brandy
the
count
said
Get
it
on
the
hill
No
Have
it
here
where
it
is
quiet
You
and
your
quiet
said
Brett
What
is
it
men
feel
about
quiet
We
like
it
said
the
count
Like
you
like
noise
my
dear
All
right
said
Brett
Let
's
have
one
Sommelier
the
count
called
Yes
sir
What
is
the
oldest
brandy
you
have
Eighteen
eleven
sir
Bring
us
a
bottle
I
say
Do
n't
be
ostentatious
Call
him
off
Jake
Listen
my
dear
I
get
more
value
for
my
money
in
old
brandy
than
in
any
other
antiquities
Got
many
antiquities
I
got
a
houseful
Finally
we
went
up
to
Montmartre
Inside
Zelli
's
it
was
crowded
smoky
and
noisy
The
music
hit
you
as
you
went
in
Brett
and
I
danced
It
was
so
crowded
we
could
barely
move
The
nigger
drummer
waved
at
Brett
We
were
caught
in
the
jam
dancing
in
one
place
in
front
of
him
Hahre
you
Great
Thaats
good
He
was
all
teeth
and
lips
He
's
a
great
friend
of
mine
Brett
said
Damn
good
drummer
The
music
stopped
and
we
started
toward
the
table
where
the
count
sat
Then
the
music
started
again
and
we
danced
I
looked
at
the
count
He
was
sitting
at
the
table
smoking
a
cigar
The
music
stopped
again
Let
's
go
over
Brett
started
toward
the
table
The
music
started
and
again
we
danced
tight
in
the
crowd
You
are
a
rotten
dancer
Jake
Michael
's
the
best
dancer
I
know
He
's
splendid
He
's
got
his
points
I
like
him
I
said
I
'm
damned
fond
of
him
I
'm
going
to
marry
him
Brett
said
Funny
I
have
n't
thought
about
him
for
a
week
Do
n't
you
write
him
Not
I
Never
write
letters
I
'll
bet
he
writes
to
you
Rather
Damned
good
letters
too
When
are
you
going
to
get
married
How
do
I
know
As
soon
as
we
can
get
the
divorce
Michael
's
trying
to
get
his
mother
to
put
up
for
it
Could
I
help
you
Do
n't
be
an
ass
Michael
's
people
have
loads
of
money
The
music
stopped
We
walked
over
to
the
table
The
count
stood
up
Very
nice
he
said
You
looked
very
very
nice
Do
n't
you
dance
count
I
asked
No
I
'm
too
old
Oh
come
off
it
Brett
said
My
dear
I
would
do
it
if
I
would
enjoy
it
I
enjoy
to
watch
you
dance
Splendid
Brett
said
I
'll
dance
again
for
you
some
time
I
say
What
about
your
little
friend
Zizi
Let
me
tell
you
I
support
that
boy
but
I
do
n't
want
to
have
him
around
He
is
rather
hard
You
know
I
think
that
boy
's
got
a
future
But
personally
I
do
n't
want
him
around
Jake
's
rather
the
same
way
He
gives
me
the
willys
Well
the
count
shrugged
his
shoulders
About
his
future
you
ca
n't
ever
tell
Anyhow
his
father
was
a
great
friend
of
my
father
Come
on
Let
's
dance
Brett
said
We
danced
It
was
crowded
and
close
Oh
darling
Brett
said
I
'm
so
miserable
I
had
that
feeling
of
going
through
something
that
has
all
happened
before
You
were
happy
a
minute
ago
The
drummer
shouted
You
ca
n't
two
time
It
's
all
gone
What
's
the
matter
I
do
n't
know
I
just
feel
terribly
the
drummer
chanted
Then
turned
to
his
sticks
Want
to
go
I
had
the
feeling
as
in
a
nightmare
of
it
all
being
something
repeated
something
I
had
been
through
and
that
now
I
must
go
through
again
the
drummer
sang
softly
Let
's
go
said
Brett
You
do
n't
mind
the
drummer
shouted
and
grinned
at
Brett
All
right
I
said
We
got
out
from
the
crowd
Brett
went
to
the
dressing-room
Brett
wants
to
go
I
said
to
the
count
He
nodded
Does
she
That
's
fine
You
take
the
car
I
'm
going
to
stay
here
for
a
while
Mr
Barnes
We
shook
hands
It
was
a
wonderful
time
I
said
I
wish
you
would
let
me
get
this
I
took
a
note
out
of
my
pocket
Mr
Barnes
do
n't
be
ridiculous
the
count
said
Brett
came
over
with
her
wrap
on
She
kissed
the
count
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
to
keep
him
from
standing
up
As
we
went
out
the
door
I
looked
back
and
there
were
three
girls
at
his
table
We
got
into
the
big
car
Brett
gave
the
chauffeur
the
address
of
her
hotel
No
do
n't
come
up
she
said
at
the
hotel
She
had
rung
and
the
door
was
unlatched
Really
No
Please
Good
night
Brett
I
said
I
'm
sorry
you
feel
rotten
Good
night
Jake
Good
night
darling
I
wo
n't
see
you
again
We
kissed
standing
at
the
door
She
pushed
me
away
We
kissed
again
Oh
do
n't
Brett
said
She
turned
quickly
and
went
into
the
hotel
The
chauffeur
drove
me
around
to
my
flat
I
gave
him
twenty
francs
and
he
touched
his
cap
and
said
Good
night
sir
and
drove
off
I
rang
the
bell
The
door
opened
and
I
went
up-stairs
and
went
to
bed
I
did
not
see
Brett
again
until
she
came
back
from
San
Sebastian
One
card
came
from
her
from
there
It
had
a
picture
of
the
Concha
and
said
Darling
Very
quiet
and
healthy
Love
to
all
the
chaps
BRETT
Nor
did
I
see
Robert
Cohn
again
I
heard
Frances
had
left
for
England
and
I
had
a
note
from
Cohn
saying
he
was
going
out
in
the
country
for
a
couple
of
weeks
he
did
not
know
where
but
that
he
wanted
to
hold
me
to
the
fishing-trip
in
Spain
we
had
talked
about
last
winter
I
could
reach
him
always
he
wrote
through
his
bankers
Brett
was
gone
I
was
not
bothered
by
Cohn
's
troubles
I
rather
enjoyed
not
having
to
play
tennis
there
was
plenty
of
work
to
do
I
went
often
to
the
races
dined
with
friends
and
put
in
some
extra
time
at
the
office
getting
things
ahead
so
I
could
leave
it
in
charge
of
my
secretary
when
Bill
Gorton
and
I
should
shove
off
to
Spain
the
end
of
June
Bill
Gorton
arrived
put
up
a
couple
of
days
at
the
flat
and
went
off
to
Vienna
He
was
very
cheerful
and
said
the
States
were
wonderful
New
York
was
wonderful
There
had
been
a
grand
theatrical
season
and
a
whole
crop
of
great
young
light
heavyweights
Any
one
of
them
was
a
good
prospect
to
grow
up
put
on
weight
and
trim
Dempsey
Bill
was
very
happy
He
had
made
a
lot
of
money
on
his
last
book
and
was
going
to
make
a
lot
more
We
had
a
good
time
while
he
was
in
Paris
and
then
he
went
off
to
Vienna
He
was
coming
back
in
three
weeks
and
we
would
leave
for
Spain
to
get
in
some
fishing
and
go
to
the
fiesta
at
Pamplona
He
wrote
that
Vienna
was
wonderful
Then
a
card
from
Budapest
Jake
Budapest
is
wonderful
Then
I
got
a
wire
Back
on
Monday
Monday
evening
he
turned
up
at
the
flat
I
heard
his
taxi
stop
and
went
to
the
window
and
called
to
him
he
waved
and
started
up-stairs
carrying
his
bags
I
met
him
on
the
stairs
and
took
one
of
the
bags
Well
I
said
I
hear
you
had
a
wonderful
trip
Wonderful
he
said
Budapest
is
absolutely
wonderful
How
about
Vienna
Not
so
good
Jake
Not
so
good
It
seemed
better
than
it
was
How
do
you
mean
I
was
getting
glasses
and
a
siphon
Tight
Jake
I
was
tight
That
's
strange
Better
have
a
drink
Bill
rubbed
his
forehead
Remarkable
thing
he
said
Do
n't
know
how
it
happened
Suddenly
it
happened
Last
long
Four
days
Jake
Lasted
just
four
days
Where
did
you
go
Do
n't
remember
Wrote
you
a
post-card
Remember
that
perfectly
Do
anything
else
Not
so
sure
Possible
Go
on
Tell
me
about
it
Ca
n't
remember
Tell
you
anything
I
could
remember
Go
on
Take
that
drink
and
remember
Might
remember
a
little
Bill
said
Remember
something
about
a
prize-fight
Enormous
Vienna
prize-fight
Had
a
nigger
in
it
Remember
the
nigger
perfectly
Go
on
Wonderful
nigger
Looked
like
Tiger
Flowers
only
four
times
as
big
All
of
a
sudden
everybody
started
to
throw
things
Not
me
Nigger
'd
just
knocked
local
boy
down
Nigger
put
up
his
glove
Wanted
to
make
a
speech
Awful
noble-looking
nigger
Started
to
make
a
speech
Then
local
white
boy
hit
him
Then
he
knocked
white
boy
cold
Then
everybody
commenced
to
throw
chairs
Nigger
went
home
with
us
in
our
car
Could
n't
get
his
clothes
Wore
my
coat
Remember
the
whole
thing
now
Big
sporting
evening
What
happened
Loaned
the
nigger
some
clothes
and
went
around
with
him
to
try
and
get
his
money
Claimed
nigger
owed
them
money
on
account
of
wrecking
hall
Wonder
who
translated
Was
it
me
Probably
it
was
n't
you
You
're
right
Was
n't
me
at
all
Was
another
fellow
Think
we
called
him
the
local
Harvard
man
Remember
him
now
Studying
music
How
'd
you
come
out
Not
so
good
Jake
Injustice
everywhere
Promoter
claimed
nigger
promised
let
local
boy
stay
Claimed
nigger
violated
contract
Ca
n't
knock
out
Vienna
boy
in
Vienna
'My
God
Mister
Gorton
said
nigger
'I
did
n't
do
nothing
in
there
for
forty
minutes
but
try
and
let
him
stay
That
white
boy
musta
ruptured
himself
swinging
at
me
I
never
did
hit
him
Did
you
get
any
money
No
money
Jake
All
we
could
get
was
nigger
's
clothes
Somebody
took
his
watch
too
Splendid
nigger
Big
mistake
to
have
come
to
Vienna
Not
so
good
Jake
Not
so
good
What
became
of
the
nigger
Went
back
to
Cologne
Lives
there
Married
Got
a
family
Going
to
write
me
a
letter
and
send
me
the
money
I
loaned
him
Wonderful
nigger
Hope
I
gave
him
the
right
address
You
probably
did
Well
anyway
let
's
eat
said
Bill
Unless
you
want
me
to
tell
you
some
more
travel
stories
Go
on
Let
's
eat
We
went
down-stairs
and
out
onto
the
Boulevard
St
Michel
in
the
warm
June
evening
Where
will
we
go
Want
to
eat
on
the
island
Sure
We
walked
down
the
Boulevard
At
the
juncture
of
the
Rue
Denfert-Rochereau
with
the
Boulevard
is
a
statue
of
two
men
in
flowing
robes
I
know
who
they
are
Bill
eyed
the
monument
Gentlemen
who
invented
pharmacy
Do
n't
try
and
fool
me
on
Paris
We
went
on
Here
's
a
taxidermist
's
Bill
said
Want
to
buy
anything
Nice
stuffed
dog
Come
on
I
said
You
're
pie-eyed
Pretty
nice
stuffed
dogs
Bill
said
Certainly
brighten
up
your
flat
Come
on
Just
one
stuffed
dog
I
can
take
'em
or
leave
'em
alone
But
listen
Jake
Just
one
stuffed
dog
Come
on
Mean
everything
in
the
world
to
you
after
you
bought
it
Simple
exchange
of
values
You
give
them
money
They
give
you
a
stuffed
dog
We
'll
get
one
on
the
way
back
All
right
Have
it
your
own
way
Road
to
hell
paved
with
unbought
stuffed
dogs
Not
my
fault
We
went
on
How
'd
you
feel
that
way
about
dogs
so
sudden
Always
felt
that
way
about
dogs
Always
been
a
great
lover
of
stuffed
animals
We
stopped
and
had
a
drink
Certainly
like
to
drink
Bill
said
You
ought
to
try
it
some
times
Jake
You
're
about
a
hundred
and
forty-four
ahead
of
me
Ought
not
to
daunt
you
Never
be
daunted
Secret
of
my
success
Never
been
daunted
Never
been
daunted
in
public
Where
were
you
drinking
Stopped
at
the
Crillon
George
made
me
a
couple
of
Jack
Roses
George
's
a
great
man
Know
the
secret
of
his
success
Never
been
daunted
You
'll
be
daunted
after
about
three
more
pernods
Not
in
public
If
I
begin
to
feel
daunted
I
'll
go
off
by
myself
I
'm
like
a
cat
that
way
When
did
you
see
Harvey
Stone
At
the
Crillon
Harvey
was
just
a
little
daunted
Had
n't
eaten
for
three
days
Does
n't
eat
any
more
Just
goes
off
like
a
cat
Pretty
sad
He
's
all
right
Splendid
Wish
he
would
n't
keep
going
off
like
a
cat
though
Makes
me
nervous
What
'll
we
do
to-night
Does
n't
make
any
difference
Only
let
's
not
get
daunted
Suppose
they
got
any
hard-boiled
eggs
here
If
they
had
hard-boiled
eggs
here
we
would
n't
have
to
go
all
the
way
down
to
the
island
to
eat
Nix
I
said
We
're
going
to
have
a
regular
meal
Just
a
suggestion
said
Bill
Want
to
start
now
Come
on
We
started
on
again
down
the
Boulevard
A
horse-cab
passed
us
Bill
looked
at
it
See
that
horse-cab
Going
to
have
that
horse-cab
stuffed
for
you
for
Christmas
Going
to
give
all
my
friends
stuffed
animals
I
'm
a
nature-writer
A
taxi
passed
some
one
in
it
waved
then
banged
for
the
driver
to
stop
The
taxi
backed
up
to
the
curb
In
it
was
Brett
Beautiful
lady
said
Bill
Going
to
kidnap
us
Hullo
Brett
said
Hullo
This
is
Bill
Gorton
Lady
Ashley
Brett
smiled
at
Bill
I
say
I
'm
just
back
Have
n't
bathed
even
Michael
comes
in
to-night
Good
Come
on
and
eat
with
us
and
we
'll
all
go
to
meet
him
Must
clean
myself
Oh
rot
Come
on
Must
bathe
He
does
n't
get
in
till
nine
Come
and
have
a
drink
then
before
you
bathe
Might
do
that
Now
you
're
not
talking
rot
We
got
in
the
taxi
The
driver
looked
around
Stop
at
the
nearest
bistro
I
said
We
might
as
well
go
to
the
Closerie
Brett
said
I
ca
n't
drink
these
rotten
brandies
Closerie
des
Lilas
Brett
turned
to
Bill
Have
you
been
in
this
pestilential
city
long
Just
got
in
to-day
from
Budapest
How
was
Budapest
Wonderful
Budapest
was
wonderful
Ask
him
about
Vienna
Vienna
said
Bill
is
a
strange
city
Very
much
like
Paris
Brett
smiled
at
him
wrinkling
the
corners
of
her
eyes
Exactly
Bill
said
Very
much
like
Paris
at
this
moment
You
have
a
good
start
Sitting
out
on
the
terraces
of
the
Lilas
Brett
ordered
a
whiskey
and
soda
I
took
one
too
and
Bill
took
another
pernod
How
are
you
Jake
Great
I
said
I
've
had
a
good
time
Brett
looked
at
me
I
was
a
fool
to
go
away
she
said
One
's
an
ass
to
leave
Paris
Did
you
have
a
good
time
Oh
all
right
Interesting
Not
frightfully
amusing
See
anybody
No
hardly
anybody
I
never
went
out
Did
n't
you
swim
No
Did
n't
do
a
thing
Sounds
like
Vienna
Bill
said
Brett
wrinkled
up
the
corners
of
her
eyes
at
him
So
that
's
the
way
it
was
in
Vienna
It
was
like
everything
in
Vienna
Brett
smiled
at
him
again
You
've
a
nice
friend
Jake
He
's
all
right
I
said
He
's
a
taxidermist
That
was
in
another
country
Bill
said
And
besides
all
the
animals
were
dead
One
more
Brett
said
and
I
must
run
Do
send
the
waiter
for
a
taxi
There
's
a
line
of
them
Right
out
in
front
Good
We
had
the
drink
and
put
Brett
into
her
taxi
Mind
you
're
at
the
Select
around
ten
Make
him
come
Michael
will
be
there
We
'll
be
there
Bill
said
The
taxi
started
and
Brett
waved
Quite
a
girl
Bill
said
She
's
damned
nice
Who
's
Michael
The
man
she
's
going
to
marry
Well
well
Bill
said
That
's
always
just
the
stage
I
meet
anybody
What
'll
I
send
them
Think
they
'd
like
a
couple
of
stuffed
race-horses
We
better
eat
Is
she
really
Lady
something
or
other
Bill
asked
in
the
taxi
on
our
way
down
to
the
Ile
Saint
Louis
Oh
yes
In
the
stud-book
and
everything
Well
well
We
ate
dinner
at
Madame
Lecomte
's
restaurant
on
the
far
side
of
the
island
It
was
crowded
with
Americans
and
we
had
to
stand
up
and
wait
for
a
place
Some
one
had
put
it
in
the
American
Women
's
Club
list
as
a
quaint
restaurant
on
the
Paris
quais
as
yet
untouched
by
Americans
so
we
had
to
wait
forty-five
minutes
for
a
table
Bill
had
eaten
at
the
restaurant
in
1918
and
right
after
the
armistice
and
Madame
Lecomte
made
a
great
fuss
over
seeing
him
Does
n't
get
us
a
table
though
Bill
said
Grand
woman
though
We
had
a
good
meal
a
roast
chicken
new
green
beans
mashed
potatoes
a
salad
and
some
apple-pie
and
cheese
You
've
got
the
world
here
all
right
Bill
said
to
Madame
Lecomte
She
raised
her
hand
Oh
my
God
You
'll
be
rich
I
hope
so
After
the
coffee
and
a
fine
we
got
the
bill
chalked
up
the
same
as
ever
on
a
slate
that
was
doubtless
one
of
the
quaint
features
paid
it
shook
hands
and
went
out
You
never
come
here
any
more
Monsieur
Barnes
Madame
Lecomte
said
Too
many
compatriots
Come
at
lunch-time
It
's
not
crowded
then
Good
I
'll
be
down
soon
We
walked
along
under
the
trees
that
grew
out
over
the
river
on
the
Quai
d'Orléans
side
of
the
island
Across
the
river
were
the
broken
walls
of
old
houses
that
were
being
torn
down
They
're
going
to
cut
a
street
through
They
would
Bill
said
We
walked
on
and
circled
the
island
The
river
was
dark
and
a
bateau
mouche
went
by
all
bright
with
lights
going
fast
and
quiet
up
and
out
of
sight
under
the
bridge
Down
the
river
was
Notre
Dame
squatting
against
the
night
sky
We
crossed
to
the
left
bank
of
the
Seine
by
the
wooden
foot-bridge
from
the
Quai
de
Bethune
and
stopped
on
the
bridge
and
looked
down
the
river
at
Notre
Dame
Standing
on
the
bridge
the
island
looked
dark
the
houses
were
high
against
the
sky
and
the
trees
were
shadows
It
's
pretty
grand
Bill
said
God
I
love
to
get
back
We
leaned
on
the
wooden
rail
of
the
bridge
and
looked
up
the
river
to
the
lights
of
the
big
bridges
Below
the
water
was
smooth
and
black
It
made
no
sound
against
the
piles
of
the
bridge
A
man
and
a
girl
passed
us
They
were
walking
with
their
arms
around
each
other
We
crossed
the
bridge
and
walked
up
the
Rue
du
Cardinal
Lemoine
It
was
steep
walking
and
we
went
all
the
way
up
to
the
Place
Contrescarpe
The
arc-light
shone
through
the
leaves
of
the
trees
in
the
square
and
underneath
the
trees
was
an
S
bus
ready
to
start
Music
came
out
of
the
door
of
the
Negre
Joyeux
Through
the
window
of
the
Café
Aux
Amateurs
I
saw
the
long
zinc
bar
Outside
on
the
terrace
working
people
were
drinking
In
the
open
kitchen
of
the
Amateurs
a
girl
was
cooking
potato-chips
in
oil
There
was
an
iron
pot
of
stew
The
girl
ladled
some
onto
a
plate
for
an
old
man
who
stood
holding
a
bottle
of
red
wine
in
one
hand
Want
to
have
a
drink
No
said
Bill
I
do
n't
need
it
We
turned
to
the
right
off
the
Place
Contrescarpe
walking
along
smooth
narrow
streets
with
high
old
houses
on
both
sides
Some
of
the
houses
jutted
out
toward
the
street
Others
were
cut
back
We
came
onto
the
Rue
du
Pot
de
Fer
and
followed
it
along
until
it
brought
us
to
the
rigid
north
and
south
of
the
Rue
Saint
Jacques
and
then
walked
south
past
Val
de
Grâce
set
back
behind
the
courtyard
and
the
iron
fence
to
the
Boulevard
du
Port
Royal
What
do
you
want
to
do
I
asked
Go
up
to
the
café
and
see
Brett
and
Mike
Why
not
We
walked
along
Port
Royal
until
it
became
Montparnasse
and
then
on
past
the
Lilas
Lavigne
's
and
all
the
little
cafés
Damoy
's
crossed
the
street
to
the
Rotonde
past
its
lights
and
tables
to
the
Select
Michael
came
toward
us
from
the
tables
He
was
tanned
and
healthy-looking
Hel-lo
