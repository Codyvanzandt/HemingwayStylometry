old
Wilson-Harris
Bill
said
We
call
you
Harris
because
we
're
so
fond
of
you
I
say
Barnes
You
do
n't
know
what
this
all
means
to
me
Come
on
and
utilize
another
glass
I
said
Barnes
Really
Barnes
you
ca
n't
know
That
's
all
Drink
up
Harris
We
walked
back
down
the
road
from
Roncesvalles
with
Harris
between
us
We
had
lunch
at
the
inn
and
Harris
went
with
us
to
the
bus
He
gave
us
his
card
with
his
address
in
London
and
his
club
and
his
business
address
and
as
we
got
on
the
bus
he
handed
us
each
an
envelope
I
opened
mine
and
there
were
a
dozen
flies
in
it
Harris
had
tied
them
himself
He
tied
all
his
own
flies
I
say
Harris
I
began
No
no
he
said
He
was
climbing
down
from
the
bus
They
're
not
first-rate
flies
at
all
I
only
thought
if
you
fished
them
some
time
it
might
remind
you
of
what
a
good
time
we
had
The
bus
started
Harris
stood
in
front
of
the
post-office
He
waved
As
we
started
along
the
road
he
turned
and
walked
back
toward
the
inn
Say
was
n't
that
Harris
nice
Bill
said
I
think
he
really
did
have
a
good
time
Harris
You
bet
he
did
I
wish
he
'd
come
into
Pamplona
He
wanted
to
fish
Yes
You
could
n't
tell
how
English
would
mix
with
each
other
anyway
I
suppose
not
We
got
into
Pamplona
late
in
the
afternoon
and
the
bus
stopped
in
front
of
the
Hotel
Montoya
Out
in
the
plaza
they
were
stringing
electric-light
wires
to
light
the
plaza
for
the
fiesta
A
few
kids
came
up
when
the
bus
stopped
and
a
customs
officer
for
the
town
made
all
the
people
getting
down
from
the
bus
open
their
bundles
on
the
sidewalk
We
went
into
the
hotel
and
on
the
stairs
I
met
Montoya
He
shook
hands
with
us
smiling
in
his
embarrassed
way
Your
friends
are
here
he
said
Mr
Campbell
Yes
Mr
Cohn
and
Mr
Campbell
and
Lady
Ashley
He
smiled
as
though
there
were
something
I
would
hear
about
When
did
they
get
in
Yesterday
I
've
saved
you
the
rooms
you
had
That
's
fine
Did
you
give
Mr
Campbell
the
room
on
the
plaza
Yes
All
the
rooms
we
looked
at
Where
are
our
friends
now
I
think
they
went
to
the
pelota
And
how
about
the
bulls
Montoya
smiled
To-night
he
said
To-night
at
seven
o'clock
they
bring
in
the
Villar
bulls
and
to-morrow
come
the
Miuras
Do
you
all
go
down
Oh
yes
They
've
never
seen
a
desencajonada
Montoya
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
I
'll
see
you
there
He
smiled
again
He
always
smiled
as
though
bull-fighting
were
a
very
special
secret
between
the
two
of
us
a
rather
shocking
but
really
very
deep
secret
that
we
knew
about
He
always
smiled
as
though
there
were
something
lewd
about
the
secret
to
outsiders
but
that
it
was
something
that
we
understood
It
would
not
do
to
expose
it
to
people
who
would
not
understand
Your
friend
is
he
aficionado
too
Montoya
smiled
at
Bill
Yes
He
came
all
the
way
from
New
York
to
see
the
San
Fermines
Yes
Montoya
politely
disbelieved
But
he
's
not
aficionado
like
you
He
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
again
embarrassedly
Yes
I
said
He
's
a
real
aficionado
But
he
's
not
aficionado
like
you
are
Aficion
means
passion
An
aficionado
is
one
who
is
passionate
about
the
bull-fights
All
the
good
bull-fighters
stayed
at
Montoya
's
hotel
that
is
those
with
aficion
stayed
there
The
commercial
bull-fighters
stayed
once
perhaps
and
then
did
not
come
back
The
good
ones
came
each
year
In
Montoya
's
room
were
their
photographs
The
photographs
were
dedicated
to
Juanito
Montoya
or
to
his
sister
The
photographs
of
bull-fighters
Montoya
had
really
believed
in
were
framed
Photographs
of
bull-fighters
who
had
been
without
aficion
Montoya
kept
in
a
drawer
of
his
desk
They
often
had
the
most
flattering
inscriptions
But
they
did
not
mean
anything
One
day
Montoya
took
them
all
out
and
dropped
them
in
the
waste-basket
He
did
not
want
them
around
We
often
talked
about
bulls
and
bull-fighters
I
had
stopped
at
the
Montoya
for
several
years
We
never
talked
for
very
long
at
a
time
It
was
simply
the
pleasure
of
discovering
what
we
each
felt
Men
would
come
in
from
distant
towns
and
before
they
left
Pamplona
stop
and
talk
for
a
few
minutes
with
Montoya
about
bulls
These
men
were
aficionados
Those
who
were
aficionados
could
always
get
rooms
even
when
the
hotel
was
full
Montoya
introduced
me
to
some
of
them
They
were
always
very
polite
at
first
and
it
amused
them
very
much
that
I
should
be
an
American
Somehow
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
an
American
could
not
have
aficion
He
might
simulate
it
or
confuse
it
with
excitement
but
he
could
not
really
have
it
When
they
saw
that
I
had
aficion
and
there
was
no
password
no
set
questions
that
could
bring
it
out
rather
it
was
a
sort
of
oral
spiritual
examination
with
the
questions
always
a
little
on
the
defensive
and
never
apparent
there
was
this
same
embarrassed
putting
the
hand
on
the
shoulder
or
a
Buen
hombre
But
nearly
always
there
was
the
actual
touching
It
seemed
as
though
they
wanted
to
touch
you
to
make
it
certain
Montoya
could
forgive
anything
of
a
bull-fighter
who
had
aficion
He
could
forgive
attacks
of
nerves
panic
bad
unexplainable
actions
all
sorts
of
lapses
For
one
who
had
aficion
he
could
forgive
anything
At
once
he
forgave
me
all
my
friends
Without
his
ever
saying
anything
they
were
simply
a
little
something
shameful
between
us
like
the
spilling
open
of
the
horses
in
bull-fighting
Bill
had
gone
up-stairs
as
we
came
in
and
I
found
him
washing
and
changing
in
his
room
Well
he
said
talk
a
lot
of
Spanish
He
was
telling
me
about
the
bulls
coming
in
to-night
Let
's
find
the
gang
and
go
down
All
right
They
'll
probably
be
at
the
café
Have
you
got
tickets
Yes
I
got
them
for
all
the
unloadings
What
's
it
like
He
was
pulling
his
cheek
before
the
glass
looking
to
see
if
there
were
unshaved
patches
under
the
line
of
the
jaw
It
's
pretty
good
I
said
They
let
the
bulls
out
of
the
cages
one
at
a
time
and
they
have
steers
in
the
corral
to
receive
them
and
keep
them
from
fighting
and
the
bulls
tear
in
at
the
steers
and
the
steers
run
around
like
old
maids
trying
to
quiet
them
down
Do
they
ever
gore
the
steers
Sure
Sometimes
they
go
right
after
them
and
kill
them
Ca
n't
the
steers
do
anything
No
They
're
trying
to
make
friends
What
do
they
have
them
in
for
To
quiet
down
the
bulls
and
keep
them
from
breaking
horns
against
the
stone
walls
or
goring
each
other
Must
be
swell
being
a
steer
We
went
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
door
and
walked
across
the
square
toward
the
Café
Iruña
There
were
two
lonely
looking
ticket-houses
standing
in
the
square
Their
windows
marked
SOL
SOL
Y
SOMBRA
and
SOMBRA
were
shut
They
would
not
open
until
the
day
before
the
fiesta
Across
the
square
the
white
wicker
tables
and
chairs
of
the
Iruña
extended
out
beyond
the
Arcade
to
the
edge
of
the
street
I
looked
for
Brett
and
Mike
at
the
tables
There
they
were
Brett
and
Mike
and
Robert
Cohn
Brett
was
wearing
a
Basque
beret
So
was
Mike
Robert
Cohn
was
bare-headed
and
wearing
his
spectacles
Brett
saw
us
coming
and
waved
Her
eyes
crinkled
up
as
we
came
up
to
the
table
Hello
you
chaps
she
called
Brett
was
happy
Mike
had
a
way
of
getting
an
intensity
of
feeling
into
shaking
hands
Robert
Cohn
shook
hands
because
we
were
back
Where
the
hell
have
you
been
I
asked
I
brought
them
up
here
Cohn
said
What
rot
Brett
said
We
'd
have
gotten
here
earlier
if
you
had
n't
come
You
'd
never
have
gotten
here
What
rot
You
chaps
are
brown
Look
at
Bill
Did
you
get
good
fishing
Mike
asked
We
wanted
to
join
you
It
was
n't
bad
We
missed
you
I
wanted
to
come
Cohn
said
but
I
thought
I
ought
to
bring
them
You
bring
us
What
rot
Was
it
really
good
Mike
asked
Did
you
take
many
Some
days
we
took
a
dozen
apiece
There
was
an
Englishman
up
there
Named
Harris
Bill
said
Ever
know
him
Mike
He
was
in
the
war
too
Fortunate
fellow
Mike
said
What
times
we
had
How
I
wish
those
dear
days
were
back
Do
n't
be
an
ass
Were
you
in
the
war
Mike
Cohn
asked
Was
I
not
He
was
a
very
distinguished
soldier
Brett
said
Tell
them
about
the
time
your
horse
bolted
down
Piccadilly
I
'll
not
I
've
told
that
four
times
You
never
told
me
Robert
Cohn
said
I
'll
not
tell
that
story
It
reflects
discredit
on
me
Tell
them
about
your
medals
I
'll
not
That
story
reflects
great
discredit
on
me
What
story
's
that
Brett
will
tell
you
She
tells
all
the
stories
that
reflect
discredit
on
me
Go
on
Tell
it
Brett
Should
I
I
'll
tell
it
myself
What
medals
have
you
got
Mike
I
have
n't
got
any
medals
You
must
have
some
I
suppose
I
've
the
usual
medals
But
I
never
sent
in
for
them
One
time
there
was
this
wopping
big
dinner
and
the
Prince
of
Wales
was
to
be
there
and
the
cards
said
medals
will
be
worn
So
naturally
I
had
no
medals
and
I
stopped
at
my
tailor
's
and
he
was
impressed
by
the
invitation
and
I
thought
that
's
a
good
piece
of
business
and
I
said
to
him
'You
've
got
to
fix
me
up
with
some
medals
He
said
'What
medals
sir
And
I
said
'Oh
any
medals
Just
give
me
a
few
medals
So
he
said
'What
medals
have
you
sir
And
I
said
'How
should
I
know
Did
he
think
I
spent
all
my
time
reading
the
bloody
gazette
'Just
give
me
a
good
lot
Pick
them
out
yourself
So
he
got
me
some
medals
you
know
miniature
medals
and
handed
me
the
box
and
I
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
forgot
it
Well
I
went
to
the
dinner
and
it
was
the
night
they
'd
shot
Henry
Wilson
so
the
Prince
did
n't
come
and
the
King
did
n't
come
and
no
one
wore
any
medals
and
all
these
coves
were
busy
taking
off
their
medals
and
I
had
mine
in
my
pocket
He
stopped
for
us
to
laugh
Is
that
all
That
's
all
Perhaps
I
did
n't
tell
it
right
You
did
n't
said
Brett
But
no
matter
We
were
all
laughing
Ah
yes
said
Mike
I
know
now
It
was
a
damn
dull
dinner
and
I
could
n't
stick
it
so
I
left
Later
on
in
the
evening
I
found
the
box
in
my
pocket
What
's
this
I
said
Medals
Bloody
military
medals
So
I
cut
them
all
off
their
backing
you
know
they
put
them
on
a
strip
and
gave
them
all
around
Gave
one
to
each
girl
Form
of
souvenir
They
thought
I
was
hell
's
own
shakes
of
a
soldier
Give
away
medals
in
a
night
club
Dashing
fellow
Tell
the
rest
Brett
said
Do
n't
you
think
that
was
funny
Mike
asked
We
were
all
laughing
It
was
I
swear
it
was
Any
rate
my
tailor
wrote
me
and
wanted
the
medals
back
Sent
a
man
around
Kept
on
writing
for
months
Seems
some
chap
had
left
them
to
be
cleaned
Frightfully
military
cove
Set
hell
's
own
store
by
them
Mike
paused
Rotten
luck
for
the
tailor
he
said
You
do
n't
mean
it
Bill
said
I
should
think
it
would
have
been
grand
for
the
tailor
Frightfully
good
tailor
Never
believe
it
to
see
me
now
Mike
said
I
used
to
pay
him
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
just
to
keep
him
quiet
So
he
would
n't
send
me
any
bills
Frightful
blow
to
him
when
I
went
bankrupt
It
was
right
after
the
medals
Gave
his
letters
rather
a
bitter
tone
How
did
you
go
bankrupt
Bill
asked
Two
ways
Mike
said
Gradually
and
then
suddenly
What
brought
it
on
Friends
said
Mike
I
had
a
lot
of
friends
False
friends
Then
I
had
creditors
too
Probably
had
more
creditors
than
anybody
in
England
Tell
them
about
in
the
court
Brett
said
I
do
n't
remember
Mike
said
I
was
just
a
little
tight
Tight
Brett
exclaimed
You
were
blind
Extraordinary
thing
Mike
said
Met
my
former
partner
the
other
day
Offered
to
buy
me
a
drink
Tell
them
about
your
learned
counsel
Brett
said
I
will
not
Mike
said
My
learned
counsel
was
blind
too
I
say
this
is
a
gloomy
subject
Are
we
going
down
and
see
these
bulls
unloaded
or
not
Let
's
go
down
We
called
the
waiter
paid
and
started
to
walk
through
the
town
I
started
off
walking
with
Brett
but
Robert
Cohn
came
up
and
joined
her
on
the
other
side
The
three
of
us
walked
along
past
the
Ayuntamiento
with
the
banners
hung
from
the
balcony
down
past
the
market
and
down
past
the
steep
street
that
led
to
the
bridge
across
the
Arga
There
were
many
people
walking
to
go
and
see
the
bulls
and
carriages
drove
down
the
hill
and
across
the
bridge
the
drivers
the
horses
and
the
whips
rising
above
the
walking
people
in
the
street
Across
the
bridge
we
turned
up
a
road
to
the
corrals
We
passed
a
wine-shop
with
a
sign
in
the
window
Good
Wine
30
Centimes
A
Liter
That
's
where
we
'll
go
when
funds
get
low
Brett
said
The
woman
standing
in
the
door
of
the
wine-shop
looked
at
us
as
we
passed
She
called
to
some
one
in
the
house
and
three
girls
came
to
the
window
and
stared
They
were
staring
at
Brett
At
the
gate
of
the
corrals
two
men
took
tickets
from
the
people
that
went
in
We
went
in
through
the
gate
There
were
trees
inside
and
a
low
stone
house
At
the
far
end
was
the
stone
wall
of
the
corrals
with
apertures
in
the
stone
that
were
like
loopholes
running
all
along
the
face
of
each
corral
A
ladder
led
up
to
the
top
of
the
wall
and
people
were
climbing
up
the
ladder
and
spreading
down
to
stand
on
the
walls
that
separated
the
two
corrals
As
we
came
up
the
ladder
walking
across
the
grass
under
the
trees
we
passed
the
big
gray
painted
cages
with
the
bulls
in
them
There
was
one
bull
in
each
travelling-box
They
had
come
by
train
from
a
bull-breeding
ranch
in
Castile
and
had
been
unloaded
off
flat-cars
at
the
station
and
brought
up
here
to
be
let
out
of
their
cages
into
the
corrals
Each
cage
was
stencilled
with
the
name
and
the
brand
of
the
bull-breeder
We
climbed
up
and
found
a
place
on
the
wall
looking
down
into
the
corral
The
stone
walls
were
whitewashed
and
there
was
straw
on
the
ground
and
wooden
feed-boxes
and
water-troughs
set
against
the
wall
Look
up
there
I
said
Beyond
the
river
rose
the
plateau
of
the
town
All
along
the
old
walls
and
ramparts
people
were
standing
The
three
lines
of
fortifications
made
three
black
lines
of
people
Above
the
walls
there
were
heads
in
the
windows
of
the
houses
At
the
far
end
of
the
plateau
boys
had
climbed
into
the
trees
They
must
think
something
is
going
to
happen
Brett
said
They
want
to
see
the
bulls
Mike
and
Bill
were
on
the
other
wall
across
the
pit
of
the
corral
They
waved
to
us
People
who
had
come
late
were
standing
behind
us
pressing
against
us
when
other
people
crowded
them
Why
do
n't
they
start
Robert
Cohn
asked
A
single
mule
was
hitched
to
one
of
the
cages
and
dragged
it
up
against
the
gate
in
the
corral
wall
The
men
shoved
and
lifted
it
with
crowbars
into
position
against
the
gate
Men
were
standing
on
the
wall
ready
to
pull
up
the
gate
of
the
corral
and
then
the
gate
of
the
cage
At
the
other
end
of
the
corral
a
gate
opened
and
two
steers
came
in
swaying
their
heads
and
trotting
their
lean
flanks
swinging
They
stood
together
at
the
far
end
their
heads
toward
the
gate
where
the
bull
would
enter
They
do
n't
look
happy
Brett
said
The
men
on
top
of
the
wall
leaned
back
and
pulled
up
the
door
of
the
corral
Then
they
pulled
up
the
door
of
the
cage
I
leaned
way
over
the
wall
and
tried
to
see
into
the
cage
It
was
dark
Some
one
rapped
on
the
cage
with
an
iron
bar
Inside
something
seemed
to
explode
The
bull
striking
into
the
wood
from
side
to
side
with
his
horns
made
a
great
noise
Then
I
saw
a
dark
muzzle
and
the
shadow
of
horns
and
then
with
a
clattering
on
the
wood
in
the
hollow
box
the
bull
charged
and
came
out
into
the
corral
skidding
with
his
forefeet
in
the
straw
as
he
stopped
his
head
up
the
great
hump
of
muscle
on
his
neck
swollen
tight
his
body
muscles
quivering
as
he
looked
up
at
the
crowd
on
the
stone
walls
The
two
steers
backed
away
against
the
wall
their
heads
sunken
their
eyes
watching
the
bull
The
bull
saw
them
and
charged
A
man
shouted
from
behind
one
of
the
boxes
and
slapped
his
hat
against
the
planks
and
the
bull
before
he
reached
the
steer
turned
gathered
himself
and
charged
where
the
man
had
been
trying
to
reach
him
behind
the
planks
with
a
half-dozen
quick
searching
drives
with
the
right
horn
My
God
is
n't
he
beautiful
Brett
said
We
were
looking
right
down
on
him
Look
how
he
knows
how
to
use
his
horns
I
said
He
's
got
a
left
and
a
right
just
like
a
boxer
Not
really
You
watch
It
goes
too
fast
Wait
There
'll
be
another
one
in
a
minute
They
had
backed
up
another
cage
into
the
entrance
In
the
far
corner
a
man
from
behind
one
of
the
plank
shelters
attracted
the
bull
and
while
the
bull
was
facing
away
the
gate
was
pulled
up
and
a
second
bull
came
out
into
the
corral
He
charged
straight
for
the
steers
and
two
men
ran
out
from
behind
the
planks
and
shouted
to
turn
him
He
did
not
change
his
direction
and
the
men
shouted
Hah
Hah
Toro
and
waved
their
arms
the
two
steers
turned
sideways
to
take
the
shock
and
the
bull
drove
into
one
of
the
steers
Do
n't
look
I
said
to
Brett
She
was
watching
fascinated
Fine
I
said
If
it
does
n't
buck
you
I
saw
it
she
said
I
saw
him
shift
from
his
left
to
his
right
horn
Damn
good
The
steer
was
down
now
his
neck
stretched
out
his
head
twisted
he
lay
the
way
he
had
fallen
Suddenly
the
bull
left
off
and
made
for
the
other
steer
which
had
been
standing
at
the
far
end
his
head
swinging
watching
it
all
The
steer
ran
awkwardly
and
the
bull
caught
him
hooked
him
lightly
in
the
flank
and
then
turned
away
and
looked
up
at
the
crowd
on
the
walls
his
crest
of
muscle
rising
The
steer
came
up
to
him
and
made
as
though
to
nose
at
him
and
the
bull
hooked
perfunctorily
The
next
time
he
nosed
at
the
steer
and
then
the
two
of
them
trotted
over
to
the
other
bull
When
the
next
bull
came
out
all
three
the
two
bulls
and
the
steer
stood
together
their
heads
side
by
side
their
horns
against
the
newcomer
In
a
few
minutes
the
steer
picked
the
new
bull
up
quieted
him
down
and
made
him
one
of
the
herd
When
the
last
two
bulls
had
been
unloaded
the
herd
were
all
together
The
steer
who
had
been
gored
had
gotten
to
his
feet
and
stood
against
the
stone
wall
None
of
the
bulls
came
near
him
and
he
did
not
attempt
to
join
the
herd
We
climbed
down
from
the
wall
with
the
crowd
and
had
a
last
look
at
the
bulls
through
the
loopholes
in
the
wall
of
the
corral
They
were
all
quiet
now
their
heads
down
We
got
a
carriage
outside
and
rode
up
to
the
café
Mike
and
Bill
came
in
half
an
hour
later
They
had
stopped
on
the
way
for
several
drinks
We
were
sitting
in
the
café
That
's
an
extraordinary
business
Brett
said
Will
those
last
ones
fight
as
well
as
the
first
Robert
Cohn
asked
They
seemed
to
quiet
down
awfully
fast
They
all
know
each
other
I
said
They
're
only
dangerous
when
they
're
alone
or
only
two
or
three
of
them
together
What
do
you
mean
dangerous
Bill
said
They
all
looked
dangerous
to
me
They
only
want
to
kill
when
they
're
alone
Of
course
if
you
went
in
there
you
'd
probably
detach
one
of
them
from
the
herd
and
he
'd
be
dangerous
That
's
too
complicated
Bill
said
Do
n't
you
ever
detach
me
from
the
herd
Mike
I
say
Mike
said
they
were
fine
bulls
were
n't
they
Did
you
see
their
horns
Did
I
not
said
Brett
I
had
no
idea
what
they
were
like
Did
you
see
the
one
hit
that
steer
Mike
asked
That
was
extraordinary
It
's
no
life
being
a
steer
Robert
Cohn
said
Do
n't
you
think
so
Mike
said
I
would
have
thought
you
'd
loved
being
a
steer
Robert
What
do
you
mean
Mike
They
lead
such
a
quiet
life
They
never
say
anything
and
they
're
always
hanging
about
so
We
were
embarrassed
Bill
laughed
Robert
Cohn
was
angry
Mike
went
on
talking
I
should
think
you
'd
love
it
You
'd
never
have
to
say
a
word
Come
on
Robert
Do
say
something
Do
n't
just
sit
there
I
said
something
Mike
Do
n't
you
remember
About
the
steers
Oh
say
something
more
Say
something
funny
Ca
n't
you
see
we
're
all
having
a
good
time
here
Come
off
it
Michael
You
're
drunk
Brett
said
I
'm
not
drunk
I
'm
quite
serious
Is
Robert
Cohn
going
to
follow
Brett
around
like
a
steer
all
the
time
Shut
up
Michael
Try
and
show
a
little
breeding
Breeding
be
damned
Who
has
any
breeding
anyway
except
the
bulls
Are
n't
the
bulls
lovely
Do
n't
you
like
them
Bill
Why
do
n't
you
say
something
Robert
Do
n't
sit
there
looking
like
a
bloody
funeral
What
if
Brett
did
sleep
with
you
She
's
slept
with
lots
of
better
people
than
you
Shut
up
Cohn
said
He
stood
up
Shut
up
Mike
Oh
do
n't
stand
up
and
act
as
though
you
were
going
to
hit
me
That
wo
n't
make
any
difference
to
me
Tell
me
Robert
Why
do
you
follow
Brett
around
like
a
poor
bloody
steer
Do
n't
you
know
you
're
not
wanted
I
know
when
I
'm
not
wanted
Why
do
n't
you
know
when
you
're
not
wanted
You
came
down
to
San
Sebastian
where
you
were
n't
wanted
and
followed
Brett
around
like
a
bloody
steer
Do
you
think
that
's
right
Shut
up
You
're
drunk
Perhaps
I
am
drunk
Why
are
n't
you
drunk
Why
do
n't
you
ever
get
drunk
Robert
You
know
you
did
n't
have
a
good
time
at
San
Sebastian
because
none
of
our
friends
would
invite
you
on
any
of
the
parties
You
ca
n't
blame
them
hardly
Can
you
I
asked
them
to
They
would
n't
do
it
You
ca
n't
blame
them
now
Can
you
Now
answer
me
Can
you
blame
them
Go
to
hell
Mike
I
ca
n't
blame
them
Can
you
blame
them
Why
do
you
follow
Brett
around
Have
n't
you
any
manners
How
do
you
think
it
makes
me
feel
You
're
a
splendid
one
to
talk
about
manners
Brett
said
You
've
such
lovely
manners
Come
on
Robert
Bill
said
What
do
you
follow
her
around
for
Bill
stood
up
and
took
hold
of
Cohn
Do
n't
go
Mike
said
Robert
Cohn
's
going
to
buy
a
drink
Bill
went
off
with
Cohn
Cohn
's
face
was
sallow
Mike
went
on
talking
I
sat
and
listened
for
a
while
Brett
looked
disgusted
I
say
Michael
you
might
not
be
such
a
bloody
ass
she
interrupted
I
'm
not
saying
he
's
not
right
you
know
She
turned
to
me
The
emotion
left
Mike
's
voice
We
were
all
friends
together
I
'm
not
so
damn
drunk
as
I
sounded
he
said
I
know
you
're
not
Brett
said
We
're
none
of
us
sober
I
said
I
did
n't
say
anything
I
did
n't
mean
But
you
put
it
so
badly
Brett
laughed
He
was
an
ass
though
He
came
down
to
San
Sebastian
where
he
damn
well
was
n't
wanted
He
hung
around
Brett
and
just
looked
at
her
It
made
me
damned
well
sick
He
did
behave
very
badly
Brett
said
Mark
you
Brett
's
had
affairs
with
men
before
She
tells
me
all
about
everything
She
gave
me
this
chap
Cohn
's
letters
to
read
I
would
n't
read
them
Damned
noble
of
you
No
listen
Jake
Brett
's
gone
off
with
men
But
they
were
n't
ever
Jews
and
they
did
n't
come
and
hang
about
afterward
Damned
good
chaps
Brett
said
It
's
all
rot
to
talk
about
it
Michael
and
I
understand
each
other
She
gave
me
Robert
Cohn
's
letters
I
would
n't
read
them
You
would
n't
read
any
letters
darling
You
would
n't
read
mine
I
ca
n't
read
letters
Mike
said
Funny
is
n't
it
You
ca
n't
read
anything
No
You
're
wrong
there
I
read
quite
a
bit
I
read
when
I
'm
at
home
You
'll
be
writing
next
Brett
said
Come
on
Michael
Do
buck
up
You
've
got
to
go
through
with
this
thing
now
He
's
here
Do
n't
spoil
the
fiesta
Well
let
him
behave
then
He
'll
behave
I
'll
tell
him
You
tell
him
Jake
Tell
him
either
he
must
behave
or
get
out
Yes
I
said
it
would
be
nice
for
me
to
tell
him
Look
Brett
Tell
Jake
what
Robert
calls
you
That
is
perfect
you
know
Oh
no
I
ca
n't
Go
on
We
're
all
friends
Are
n't
we
all
friends
Jake
I
ca
n't
tell
him
It
's
too
ridiculous
I
'll
tell
him
You
wo
n't
Michael
Do
n't
be
an
ass
He
calls
her
Circe
Mike
said
He
claims
she
turns
men
into
swine
Damn
good
I
wish
I
were
one
of
these
literary
chaps
He
'd
be
good
you
know
Brett
said
He
writes
a
good
letter
I
know
I
said
He
wrote
me
from
San
Sebastian
That
was
nothing
Brett
said
He
can
write
a
damned
amusing
letter
She
made
me
write
that
She
was
supposed
to
be
ill
I
damned
well
was
too
Come
on
I
said
we
must
go
in
and
eat
How
should
I
meet
Cohn
Mike
said
Just
act
as
though
nothing
had
happened
It
's
quite
all
right
with
me
Mike
said
I
'm
not
embarrassed
If
he
says
anything
just
say
you
were
tight
Quite
And
the
funny
thing
is
I
think
I
was
tight
Come
on
Brett
said
Are
these
poisonous
things
paid
for
I
must
bathe
before
dinner
We
walked
across
the
square
It
was
dark
and
all
around
the
square
were
the
lights
from
the
cafés
under
the
arcades
We
walked
across
the
gravel
under
the
trees
to
the
hotel
They
went
up-stairs
and
I
stopped
to
speak
with
Montoya
Well
how
did
you
like
the
bulls
he
asked
Good
They
were
nice
bulls
They
're
all
right
Montoya
shook
his
head
but
they
're
not
too
good
What
did
n't
you
like
about
them
I
do
n't
know
They
just
did
n't
give
me
the
feeling
that
they
were
so
good
I
know
what
you
mean
They
're
all
right
Yes
They
're
all
right
How
did
your
friends
like
them
Fine
Good
Montoya
said
I
went
up-stairs
Bill
was
in
his
room
standing
on
the
balcony
looking
out
at
the
square
I
stood
beside
him
Where
's
Cohn
Up-stairs
in
his
room
How
does
he
feel
Like
hell
naturally
Mike
was
awful
He
's
terrible
when
he
's
tight
He
was
n't
so
tight
The
hell
he
was
n't
I
know
what
we
had
before
we
came
to
the
café
He
sobered
up
afterward
Good
He
was
terrible
I
do
n't
like
Cohn
God
knows
and
I
think
it
was
a
silly
trick
for
him
to
go
down
to
San
Sebastian
but
nobody
has
any
business
to
talk
like
Mike
How
'd
you
like
the
bulls
Grand
It
's
grand
the
way
they
bring
them
out
To-morrow
come
the
Miuras
When
does
the
fiesta
start
Day
after
to-morrow
We
've
got
to
keep
Mike
from
getting
so
tight
That
kind
of
stuff
is
terrible
We
'd
better
get
cleaned
up
for
supper
Yes
That
will
be
a
pleasant
meal
Wo
n't
it
As
a
matter
of
fact
supper
was
a
pleasant
meal
Brett
wore
a
black
sleeveless
evening
dress
She
looked
quite
beautiful
Mike
acted
as
though
nothing
had
happened
I
had
to
go
up
and
bring
Robert
Cohn
down
He
was
reserved
and
formal
and
his
