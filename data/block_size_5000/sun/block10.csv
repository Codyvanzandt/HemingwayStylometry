little
Spanish
fiesta
I
'll
festa
them
Bill
said
You
're
an
extraordinarily
beautiful
girl
Mike
turned
to
Bill
's
friend
When
did
you
come
here
Come
off
it
Michael
I
say
she
is
a
lovely
girl
Where
have
I
been
Where
have
I
been
looking
all
this
while
You
're
a
lovely
thing
Have
we
met
Come
along
with
me
and
Bill
We
're
going
to
festa
the
English
I
'll
festa
them
Bill
said
What
the
hell
are
they
doing
at
this
fiesta
Come
on
Mike
said
Just
us
three
We
're
going
to
festa
the
bloody
English
I
hope
you
're
not
English
I
'm
Scotch
I
hate
the
English
I
'm
going
to
festa
them
Come
on
Bill
Through
the
window
we
saw
them
all
three
arm
in
arm
going
toward
the
café
Rockets
were
going
up
in
the
square
I
'm
going
to
sit
here
Brett
said
I
'll
stay
with
you
Cohn
said
Oh
do
n't
Brett
said
For
God
's
sake
go
off
somewhere
Ca
n't
you
see
Jake
and
I
want
to
talk
I
did
n't
Cohn
said
I
thought
I
'd
sit
here
because
I
felt
a
little
tight
What
a
hell
of
a
reason
for
sitting
with
any
one
If
you
're
tight
go
to
bed
Go
on
to
bed
Was
I
rude
enough
to
him
Brett
asked
Cohn
was
gone
My
God
I
'm
so
sick
of
him
He
does
n't
add
much
to
the
gayety
He
depresses
me
so
He
's
behaved
very
badly
Damned
badly
He
had
a
chance
to
behave
so
well
He
's
probably
waiting
just
outside
the
door
now
Yes
He
would
You
know
I
do
know
how
he
feels
He
ca
n't
believe
it
did
n't
mean
anything
I
know
Nobody
else
would
behave
as
badly
Oh
I
'm
so
sick
of
the
whole
thing
And
Michael
Michael
's
been
lovely
too
It
's
been
damned
hard
on
Mike
Yes
But
he
did
n't
need
to
be
a
swine
Everybody
behaves
badly
I
said
Give
them
the
proper
chance
You
would
n't
behave
badly
Brett
looked
at
me
I
'd
be
as
big
an
ass
as
Cohn
I
said
Darling
do
n't
let
's
talk
a
lot
of
rot
All
right
Talk
about
anything
you
like
Do
n't
be
difficult
You
're
the
only
person
I
've
got
and
I
feel
rather
awful
to-night
You
've
got
Mike
Yes
Mike
Has
n't
he
been
pretty
Well
I
said
it
's
been
damned
hard
on
Mike
having
Cohn
around
and
seeing
him
with
you
Do
n't
I
know
it
darling
Please
do
n't
make
me
feel
any
worse
than
I
do
Brett
was
nervous
as
I
had
never
seen
her
before
She
kept
looking
away
from
me
and
looking
ahead
at
the
wall
Want
to
go
for
a
walk
Yes
Come
on
I
corked
up
the
Fundador
bottle
and
gave
it
to
the
bartender
Let
's
have
one
more
drink
of
that
Brett
said
My
nerves
are
rotten
We
each
drank
a
glass
of
the
smooth
amontillado
brandy
Come
on
said
Brett
As
we
came
out
the
door
I
saw
Cohn
walk
out
from
under
the
arcade
He
was
there
Brett
said
He
ca
n't
be
away
from
you
Poor
devil
I
'm
not
sorry
for
him
I
hate
him
myself
I
hate
him
too
she
shivered
I
hate
his
damned
suffering
We
walked
arm
in
arm
down
the
side
street
away
from
the
crowd
and
the
lights
of
the
square
The
street
was
dark
and
wet
and
we
walked
along
it
to
the
fortifications
at
the
edge
of
town
We
passed
wine-shops
with
light
coming
out
from
their
doors
onto
the
black
wet
street
and
sudden
bursts
of
music
Want
to
go
in
No
We
walked
out
across
the
wet
grass
and
onto
the
stone
wall
of
the
fortifications
I
spread
a
newspaper
on
the
stone
and
Brett
sat
down
Across
the
plain
it
was
dark
and
we
could
see
the
mountains
The
wind
was
high
up
and
took
the
clouds
across
the
moon
Below
us
were
the
dark
pits
of
the
fortifications
Behind
were
the
trees
and
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
and
the
town
silhouetted
against
the
moon
Do
n't
feel
bad
I
said
I
feel
like
hell
Brett
said
Do
n't
let
's
talk
We
looked
out
at
the
plain
The
long
lines
of
trees
were
dark
in
the
moonlight
There
were
the
lights
of
a
car
on
the
road
climbing
the
mountain
Up
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
we
saw
the
lights
of
the
fort
Below
to
the
left
was
the
river
It
was
high
from
the
rain
and
black
and
smooth
Trees
were
dark
along
the
banks
We
sat
and
looked
out
Brett
stared
straight
ahead
Suddenly
she
shivered
It
's
cold
Want
to
walk
back
Through
the
park
We
climbed
down
It
was
clouding
over
again
In
the
park
it
was
dark
under
the
trees
Do
you
still
love
me
Jake
Yes
I
said
Because
I
'm
a
goner
Brett
said
How
I
'm
a
goner
I
'm
mad
about
the
Romero
boy
I
'm
in
love
with
him
I
think
I
would
n't
be
if
I
were
you
I
ca
n't
help
it
I
'm
a
goner
It
's
tearing
me
all
up
inside
Do
n't
do
it
I
ca
n't
help
it
I
've
never
been
able
to
help
anything
You
ought
to
stop
it
How
can
I
stop
it
I
ca
n't
stop
things
Feel
that
Her
hand
was
trembling
I
'm
like
that
all
through
You
ought
n't
to
do
it
I
ca
n't
help
it
I
'm
a
goner
now
anyway
Do
n't
you
see
the
difference
No
I
've
got
to
do
something
I
've
got
to
do
something
I
really
want
to
do
I
've
lost
my
self-respect
You
do
n't
have
to
do
that
Oh
darling
do
n't
be
difficult
What
do
you
think
it
's
meant
to
have
that
damned
Jew
about
and
Mike
the
way
he
's
acted
Sure
I
ca
n't
just
stay
tight
all
the
time
No
Oh
darling
please
stay
by
me
Please
stay
by
me
and
see
me
through
this
Sure
I
do
n't
say
it
's
right
It
is
right
though
for
me
God
knows
I
've
never
felt
such
a
bitch
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
Come
on
Brett
said
Let
's
go
and
find
him
Together
we
walked
down
the
gravel
path
in
the
park
in
the
dark
under
the
trees
and
then
out
from
under
the
trees
and
past
the
gate
into
the
street
that
led
into
town
Pedro
Romero
was
in
the
café
He
was
at
a
table
with
other
bull-fighters
and
bull-fight
critics
They
were
smoking
cigars
When
we
came
in
they
looked
up
Romero
smiled
and
bowed
We
sat
down
at
a
table
half-way
down
the
room
Ask
him
to
come
over
and
have
a
drink
Not
yet
He
'll
come
over
I
ca
n't
look
at
him
He
's
nice
to
look
at
I
said
I
've
always
done
just
what
I
wanted
I
know
I
do
feel
such
a
bitch
Well
I
said
My
God
said
Brett
the
things
a
woman
goes
through
Yes
Oh
I
do
feel
such
a
bitch
I
looked
across
at
the
table
Pedro
Romero
smiled
He
said
something
to
the
other
people
at
his
table
and
stood
up
He
came
over
to
our
table
I
stood
up
and
we
shook
hands
Wo
n't
you
have
a
drink
You
must
have
a
drink
with
me
he
said
He
seated
himself
asking
Brett
's
permission
without
saying
anything
He
had
very
nice
manners
But
he
kept
on
smoking
his
cigar
It
went
well
with
his
face
You
like
cigars
I
asked
Oh
yes
I
always
smoke
cigars
It
was
part
of
his
system
of
authority
It
made
him
seem
older
I
noticed
his
skin
It
was
clear
and
smooth
and
very
brown
There
was
a
triangular
scar
on
his
cheek-bone
I
saw
he
was
watching
Brett
He
felt
there
was
something
between
them
He
must
have
felt
it
when
Brett
gave
him
her
hand
He
was
being
very
careful
I
think
he
was
sure
but
he
did
not
want
to
make
any
mistake
You
fight
to-morrow
I
said
Yes
he
said
Algabeno
was
hurt
to-day
in
Madrid
Did
you
hear
No
I
said
Badly
He
shook
his
head
Nothing
Here
he
showed
his
hand
Brett
reached
out
and
spread
the
fingers
apart
Oh
he
said
in
English
you
tell
fortunes
Sometimes
Do
you
mind
No
I
like
it
He
spread
his
hand
flat
on
the
table
Tell
me
I
live
for
always
and
be
a
millionaire
He
was
still
very
polite
but
he
was
surer
of
himself
Look
he
said
do
you
see
any
bulls
in
my
hand
He
laughed
His
hand
was
very
fine
and
the
wrist
was
small
There
are
thousands
of
bulls
Brett
said
She
was
not
at
all
nervous
now
She
looked
lovely
Good
Romero
laughed
At
a
thousand
duros
apiece
he
said
to
me
in
Spanish
Tell
me
some
more
It
's
a
good
hand
Brett
said
I
think
he
'll
live
a
long
time
Say
it
to
me
Not
to
your
friend
I
said
you
'd
live
a
long
time
I
know
it
Romero
said
I
'm
never
going
to
die
I
tapped
with
my
finger-tips
on
the
table
Romero
saw
it
He
shook
his
head
No
Do
n't
do
that
The
bulls
are
my
best
friends
I
translated
to
Brett
You
kill
your
friends
she
asked
Always
he
said
in
English
and
laughed
So
they
do
n't
kill
me
He
looked
at
her
across
the
table
You
know
English
well
Yes
he
said
Pretty
well
sometimes
But
I
must
not
let
anybody
know
It
would
be
very
bad
a
torero
who
speaks
English
Why
asked
Brett
It
would
be
bad
The
people
would
not
like
it
Not
yet
Why
not
They
would
not
like
it
Bull-fighters
are
not
like
that
What
are
bull-fighters
like
He
laughed
and
tipped
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
and
changed
the
angle
of
his
cigar
and
the
expression
of
his
face
Like
at
the
table
he
said
I
glanced
over
He
had
mimicked
exactly
the
expression
of
Nacional
He
smiled
his
face
natural
again
No
I
must
forget
English
Do
n't
forget
it
yet
Brett
said
No
No
All
right
He
laughed
again
I
would
like
a
hat
like
that
Brett
said
Good
I
'll
get
you
one
Right
See
that
you
do
I
will
I
'll
get
you
one
to-night
I
stood
up
Romero
rose
too
Sit
down
I
said
I
must
go
and
find
our
friends
and
bring
them
here
He
looked
at
me
It
was
a
final
look
to
ask
if
it
were
understood
It
was
understood
all
right
Sit
down
Brett
said
to
him
You
must
teach
me
Spanish
He
sat
down
and
looked
at
her
across
the
table
I
went
out
The
hard-eyed
people
at
the
bull-fighter
table
watched
me
go
It
was
not
pleasant
When
I
came
back
and
looked
in
the
café
twenty
minutes
later
Brett
and
Pedro
Romero
were
gone
The
coffee-glasses
and
our
three
empty
cognac-glasses
were
on
the
table
A
waiter
came
with
a
cloth
and
picked
up
the
glasses
and
mopped
off
the
table
Outside
the
Bar
Milano
I
found
Bill
and
Mike
and
Edna
Edna
was
the
girl
's
name
We
've
been
thrown
out
Edna
said
By
the
police
said
Mike
There
's
some
people
in
there
that
do
n't
like
me
I
've
kept
them
out
of
four
fights
Edna
said
You
've
got
to
help
me
Bill
's
face
was
red
Come
back
in
Edna
he
said
Go
on
in
there
and
dance
with
Mike
It
's
silly
Edna
said
There
'll
just
be
another
row
Damned
Biarritz
swine
Bill
said
Come
on
Mike
said
After
all
it
's
a
pub
They
ca
n't
occupy
a
whole
pub
Good
old
Mike
Bill
said
Damned
English
swine
come
here
and
insult
Mike
and
try
and
spoil
the
fiesta
They
're
so
bloody
Mike
said
I
hate
the
English
They
ca
n't
insult
Mike
Bill
said
Mike
is
a
swell
fellow
They
ca
n't
insult
Mike
I
wo
n't
stand
it
Who
cares
if
he
is
a
damn
bankrupt
His
voice
broke
Who
cares
Mike
said
I
do
n't
care
Jake
does
n't
care
Do
you
care
No
Edna
said
Are
you
a
bankrupt
Of
course
I
am
You
do
n't
care
do
you
Bill
Bill
put
his
arm
around
Mike
's
shoulder
I
wish
to
hell
I
was
a
bankrupt
I
'd
show
those
bastards
They
're
just
English
Mike
said
It
never
makes
any
difference
what
the
English
say
The
dirty
swine
Bill
said
I
'm
going
to
clean
them
out
Bill
Edna
looked
at
me
Please
do
n't
go
in
again
Bill
They
're
so
stupid
That
's
it
said
Mike
They
're
stupid
I
knew
that
was
what
it
was
They
ca
n't
say
things
like
that
about
Mike
Bill
said
Do
you
know
them
I
asked
Mike
No
I
never
saw
them
They
say
they
know
me
I
wo
n't
stand
it
Bill
said
Come
on
Let
's
go
over
to
the
Suizo
I
said
They
're
a
bunch
of
Edna
's
friends
from
Biarritz
Bill
said
They
're
simply
stupid
Edna
said
One
of
them
's
Charley
Blackman
from
Chicago
Bill
said
I
was
never
in
Chicago
Mike
said
Edna
started
to
laugh
and
could
not
stop
Take
me
away
from
here
she
said
you
bankrupts
What
kind
of
a
row
was
it
I
asked
Edna
We
were
walking
across
the
square
to
the
Suizo
Bill
was
gone
I
do
n't
know
what
happened
but
some
one
had
the
police
called
to
keep
Mike
out
of
the
back
room
There
were
some
people
that
had
known
Mike
at
Cannes
What
's
the
matter
with
Mike
Probably
he
owes
them
money
I
said
That
's
what
people
usually
get
bitter
about
In
front
of
the
ticket-booths
out
in
the
square
there
were
two
lines
of
people
waiting
They
were
sitting
on
chairs
or
crouched
on
the
ground
with
blankets
and
newspapers
around
them
They
were
waiting
for
the
wickets
to
open
in
the
morning
to
buy
tickets
for
the
bull-fight
The
night
was
clearing
and
the
moon
was
out
Some
of
the
people
in
the
line
were
sleeping
At
the
Café
Suizo
we
had
just
sat
down
and
ordered
Fundador
when
Robert
Cohn
came
up
Where
's
Brett
he
asked
I
do
n't
know
She
was
with
you
She
must
have
gone
to
bed
She
's
not
I
do
n't
know
where
she
is
His
face
was
sallow
under
the
light
He
was
standing
up
Tell
me
where
she
is
Sit
down
I
said
I
do
n't
know
where
she
is
The
hell
you
do
n't
You
can
shut
your
face
Tell
me
where
Brett
is
I
'll
not
tell
you
a
damn
thing
You
know
where
she
is
If
I
did
I
would
n't
tell
you
Oh
go
to
hell
Cohn
Mike
called
from
the
table
Brett
's
gone
off
with
the
bull-fighter
chap
They
're
on
their
honeymoon
You
shut
up
Oh
go
to
hell
Mike
said
languidly
Is
that
where
she
is
Cohn
turned
to
me
Go
to
hell
She
was
with
you
Is
that
where
she
is
Go
to
hell
I
'll
make
you
tell
me
he
stepped
forward
you
damned
pimp
I
swung
at
him
and
he
ducked
I
saw
his
face
duck
sideways
in
the
light
He
hit
me
and
I
sat
down
on
the
pavement
As
I
started
to
get
on
my
feet
he
hit
me
twice
I
went
down
backward
under
a
table
I
tried
to
get
up
and
felt
I
did
not
have
any
legs
I
felt
I
must
get
on
my
feet
and
try
and
hit
him
Mike
helped
me
up
Some
one
poured
a
carafe
of
water
on
my
head
Mike
had
an
arm
around
me
and
I
found
I
was
sitting
on
a
chair
Mike
was
pulling
at
my
ears
I
say
you
were
cold
Mike
said
Where
the
hell
were
you
Oh
I
was
around
You
did
n't
want
to
mix
in
it
He
knocked
Mike
down
too
Edna
said
He
did
n't
knock
me
out
Mike
said
I
just
lay
there
Does
this
happen
every
night
at
your
fiestas
Edna
asked
Was
n't
that
Mr
Cohn
I
'm
all
right
I
said
My
head
's
a
little
wobbly
There
were
several
waiters
and
a
crowd
of
people
standing
around
Vaya
said
Mike
Get
away
Go
on
The
waiters
moved
the
people
away
It
was
quite
a
thing
to
watch
Edna
said
He
must
be
a
boxer
He
is
I
wish
Bill
had
been
here
Edna
said
I
'd
like
to
have
seen
Bill
knocked
down
too
I
've
always
wanted
to
see
Bill
knocked
down
He
's
so
big
I
was
hoping
he
would
knock
down
a
waiter
Mike
said
and
get
arrested
I
'd
like
to
see
Mr
Robert
Cohn
in
jail
No
I
said
Oh
no
said
Edna
You
do
n't
mean
that
I
do
though
Mike
said
I
'm
not
one
of
these
chaps
likes
being
knocked
about
I
never
play
games
even
Mike
took
a
drink
I
never
liked
to
hunt
you
know
There
was
always
the
danger
of
having
a
horse
fall
on
you
How
do
you
feel
Jake
All
right
You
're
nice
Edna
said
to
Mike
Are
you
really
a
bankrupt
I
'm
a
tremendous
bankrupt
Mike
said
I
owe
money
to
everybody
Do
n't
you
owe
any
money
Tons
I
owe
everybody
money
Mike
said
I
borrowed
a
hundred
pesetas
from
Montoya
to-night
The
hell
you
did
I
said
I
'll
pay
it
back
Mike
said
I
always
pay
everything
back
That
's
why
you
're
a
bankrupt
is
n't
it
Edna
said
I
stood
up
I
had
heard
them
talking
from
a
long
way
away
It
all
seemed
like
some
bad
play
I
'm
going
over
to
the
hotel
I
said
Then
I
heard
them
talking
about
me
Is
he
all
right
Edna
asked
We
'd
better
walk
with
him
I
'm
all
right
I
said
Do
n't
come
I
'll
see
you
all
later
I
walked
away
from
the
café
They
were
sitting
at
the
table
I
looked
back
at
them
and
at
the
empty
tables
There
was
a
waiter
sitting
at
one
of
the
tables
with
his
head
in
his
hands
Walking
across
the
square
to
the
hotel
everything
looked
new
and
changed
I
had
never
seen
the
trees
before
I
had
never
seen
the
flagpoles
before
nor
the
front
of
the
theatre
It
was
all
different
I
felt
as
I
felt
once
coming
home
from
an
out-of-town
football
game
I
was
carrying
a
suitcase
with
my
football
things
in
it
and
I
walked
up
the
street
from
the
station
in
the
town
I
had
lived
in
all
my
life
and
it
was
all
new
They
were
raking
the
lawns
and
burning
leaves
in
the
road
and
I
stopped
for
a
long
time
and
watched
It
was
all
strange
Then
I
went
on
and
my
feet
seemed
to
be
a
long
way
off
and
everything
seemed
to
come
from
a
long
way
off
and
I
could
hear
my
feet
walking
a
great
distance
away
I
had
been
kicked
in
the
head
early
in
the
game
It
was
like
that
crossing
the
square
It
was
like
that
going
up
the
stairs
in
the
hotel
Going
up
the
stairs
took
a
long
time
and
I
had
the
feeling
that
I
was
carrying
my
suitcase
There
was
a
light
in
the
room
Bill
came
out
and
met
me
in
the
hall
Say
he
said
go
up
and
see
Cohn
He
's
been
in
a
jam
and
he
's
asking
for
you
The
hell
with
him
Go
on
Go
on
up
and
see
him
I
did
not
want
to
climb
another
flight
of
stairs
What
are
you
looking
at
me
that
way
for
I
'm
not
looking
at
you
Go
on
up
and
see
Cohn
He
's
in
bad
shape
You
were
drunk
a
little
while
ago
I
said
I
'm
drunk
now
Bill
said
But
you
go
up
and
see
Cohn
He
wants
to
see
you
All
right
I
said
It
was
just
a
matter
of
climbing
more
stairs
I
went
on
up
the
stairs
carrying
my
phantom
suitcase
I
walked
down
the
hall
to
Cohn
's
room
The
door
was
shut
and
I
knocked
Who
is
it
Barnes
Come
in
Jake
I
opened
the
door
and
went
in
and
set
down
my
suitcase
There
was
no
light
in
the
room
Cohn
was
lying
face
down
on
the
bed
in
the
dark
Hello
Jake
Do
n't
call
me
Jake
I
stood
by
the
door
It
was
just
like
this
that
I
had
come
home
Now
it
was
a
hot
bath
that
I
needed
A
deep
hot
bath
to
lie
back
in
Where
's
the
bathroom
I
asked
Cohn
was
crying
There
he
was
face
down
on
the
bed
crying
He
had
on
a
white
polo
shirt
the
kind
he
'd
worn
at
Princeton
I
'm
sorry
Jake
Please
forgive
me
Forgive
you
hell
Please
forgive
me
Jake
I
did
not
say
anything
I
stood
there
by
the
door
I
was
crazy
You
must
see
how
it
was
Oh
that
's
all
right
I
could
n't
stand
it
about
Brett
You
called
me
a
pimp
I
did
not
care
I
wanted
a
hot
bath
I
wanted
a
hot
bath
in
deep
water
I
know
Please
do
n't
remember
it
I
was
crazy
That
's
all
right
He
was
crying
His
voice
was
funny
He
lay
there
in
his
white
shirt
on
the
bed
in
the
dark
His
polo
shirt
I
'm
going
away
in
the
morning
He
was
crying
without
making
any
noise
I
just
could
n't
stand
it
about
Brett
I
've
been
through
hell
Jake
It
's
been
simply
hell
When
I
met
her
down
here
Brett
treated
me
as
though
I
were
a
perfect
stranger
I
just
could
n't
stand
it
We
lived
together
at
San
Sebastian
I
suppose
you
know
it
I
ca
n't
stand
it
any
more
He
lay
there
on
the
bed
Well
I
said
I
'm
going
to
take
a
bath
You
were
the
only
friend
I
had
and
I
loved
Brett
so
Well
I
said
so
long
I
guess
it
is
n't
any
use
he
said
I
guess
it
is
n't
any
damn
use
What
Everything
Please
say
you
forgive
me
Jake
Sure
I
said
It
's
all
right
I
felt
so
terribly
I
've
been
through
such
hell
Jake
Now
everything
's
gone
Everything
Well
I
said
so
long
I
've
got
to
go
He
rolled
over
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
then
stood
up
So
long
Jake
he
said
You
'll
shake
hands
wo
n't
you
Sure
Why
not
We
shook
hands
In
the
dark
I
could
not
see
his
face
very
well
Well
I
said
see
you
in
the
morning
I
'm
going
away
in
the
morning
Oh
yes
I
said
I
went
out
Cohn
was
standing
in
the
door
of
the
room
Are
you
all
right
Jake
he
asked
Oh
yes
I
said
I
'm
all
right
I
could
not
find
the
bathroom
After
a
while
I
found
it
There
was
a
deep
stone
tub
I
turned
on
the
taps
and
the
water
would
not
run
I
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bath-tub
When
I
got
up
to
go
I
found
I
had
taken
off
my
shoes
I
hunted
for
them
and
found
them
and
carried
them
down-stairs
I
found
my
room
and
went
inside
and
undressed
and
got
into
bed
I
woke
with
a
headache
and
the
noise
of
the
bands
going
by
in
the
street
I
remembered
I
had
promised
to
take
Bill
's
friend
Edna
to
see
the
bulls
go
through
the
street
and
into
the
ring
I
dressed
and
went
down-stairs
and
out
into
the
cold
early
morning
People
were
crossing
the
square
hurrying
toward
the
bull-ring
Across
the
square
were
the
two
lines
of
men
in
front
of
the
ticket-booths
They
were
still
waiting
for
the
tickets
to
go
on
sale
at
seven
o'clock
I
hurried
across
the
street
to
the
café
The
waiter
told
me
that
my
friends
had
been
there
and
gone
How
many
were
they
Two
gentlemen
and
a
lady
That
was
all
right
Bill
and
Mike
were
with
Edna
She
had
been
afraid
last
night
they
would
pass
out
That
was
why
I
was
to
be
sure
to
take
her
I
drank
the
coffee
and
hurried
with
the
other
people
toward
the
bull-ring
I
was
not
groggy
now
There
was
only
a
bad
headache
Everything
looked
sharp
and
clear
and
the
town
smelt
of
the
early
morning
The
stretch
of
ground
from
the
edge
of
the
town
to
the
bull-ring
was
muddy
There
was
a
crowd
all
along
the
fence
that
led
to
the
ring
and
the
outside
balconies
and
the
top
of
the
bull-ring
were
solid
with
people
I
heard
the
rocket
and
I
knew
I
could
not
get
into
the
ring
in
time
to
see
the
bulls
come
in
so
I
shoved
through
the
crowd
to
the
fence
I
was
pushed
close
against
the
planks
of
the
fence
Between
the
two
fences
of
the
runway
the
police
were
clearing
the
crowd
along
They
walked
or
trotted
on
into
the
bull-ring
Then
people
commenced
to
come
running
A
drunk
slipped
and
fell
Two
policemen
grabbed
him
and
rushed
him
over
to
the
fence
The
crowd
were
running
fast
now
There
was
a
great
shout
from
the
crowd
and
putting
my
head
through
between
the
boards
I
saw
the
bulls
just
coming
out
of
the
street
into
the
long
running
pen
They
were
going
fast
and
gaining
on
the
crowd
Just
then
another
drunk
started
out
from
the
fence
with
a
blouse
in
his
hands
He
wanted
to
do
capework
with
the
bulls
The
two
policemen
tore
out
collared
him
one
hit
him
with
a
club
and
they
dragged
him
against
the
fence
and
stood
flattened
out
against
the
fence
as
the
last
of
the
crowd
and
the
bulls
went
by
There
were
so
many
people
running
ahead
of
the
bulls
that
the
mass
thickened
and
slowed
up
going
through
the
gate
into
the
ring
and
as
the
bulls
passed
galloping
together
heavy
muddy-sided
horns
swinging
one
shot
ahead
caught
a
man
in
the
running
crowd
in
the
back
and
lifted
him
in
the
air
Both
the
man
's
arms
were
by
his
sides
his
head
went
back
as
the
horn
went
in
and
the
bull
lifted
him
and
then
dropped
him
The
bull
picked
another
man
running
in
front
but
the
man
disappeared
into
the
crowd
and
the
crowd
was
through
the
gate
and
into
the
ring
with
the
bulls
behind
them
The
red
door
of
the
ring
went
shut
the
crowd
on
the
outside
balconies
of
the
bull-ring
were
pressing
through
to
the
inside
there
was
a
shout
then
another
shout
The
man
who
had
been
gored
lay
face
down
in
the
trampled
mud
People
climbed
over
the
fence
and
I
could
not
see
the
man
because
the
crowd
was
so
thick
around
him
From
inside
the
ring
came
the
shouts
Each
shout
meant
a
charge
by
some
bull
into
the
crowd
You
could
tell
by
the
degree
of
intensity
in
the
shout
how
bad
a
thing
it
was
that
was
happening
Then
the
rocket
went
up
that
meant
the
steers
had
gotten
the
bulls
out
of
the
ring
and
into
the
corrals
I
left
the
fence
and
started
back
toward
the
town
Back
in
the
town
I
went
to
the
café
to
have
a
second
coffee
and
some
buttered
toast
The
waiters
were
sweeping
out
the
café
and
mopping
off
the
tables
One
came
over
and
took
my
order
Anything
happen
at
the
encierro
I
did
n't
see
it
all
One
man
was
badly
cogido
Where
Here
I
put
one
hand
on
the
small
of
my
back
and
the
other
on
my
chest
where
it
looked
as
though
the
horn
must
have
come
through
The
waiter
nodded
his
head
and
swept
the
crumbs
from
the
table
with
his
cloth
Badly
cogido
he
said
All
for
sport
All
for
pleasure
He
went
away
and
came
back
with
the
long-handled
coffee
and
milk
pots
He
poured
the
milk
and
coffee
It
came
out
of
the
long
spouts
in
two
streams
into
the
big
cup
The
waiter
nodded
his
head
Badly
cogido
through
the
back
he
said
He
put
the
pots
down
on
the
table
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
at
the
table
A
big
horn
wound
All
for
fun
Just
for
fun
What
do
you
think
of
that
I
do
n't
know
That
's
it
All
for
fun
Fun
you
understand
You
're
not
an
aficionado
Me
What
are
bulls
Animals
Brute
animals
He
stood
up
and
put
his
hand
on
the
small
of
his
back
Right
through
the
back
A
cornada
right
through
the
back
For
fun
you
understand
He
shook
his
head
and
walked
away
carrying
the
coffee-pots
Two
men
were
going
by
in
the
street
The
waiter
shouted
to
them
They
were
grave-looking
One
shook
his
head
Muerto
he
called
The
waiter
nodded
his
head
The
two
men
went
on
They
were
on
some
errand
The
waiter
came
over
to
my
table
You
hear
Muerto
Dead
He
's
dead
With
a
horn
through
him
All
for
morning
fun
Es
muy
flamenco
It
's
bad
Not
for
me
the
waiter
said
No
fun
in
that
for
me
Later
in
the
day
we
learned
that
the
man
who
was
killed
was
named
Vicente
Girones
and
came
from
