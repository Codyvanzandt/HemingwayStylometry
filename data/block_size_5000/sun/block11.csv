near
Tafalla
The
next
day
in
the
paper
we
read
that
he
was
twenty-eight
years
old
and
had
a
farm
a
wife
and
two
children
He
had
continued
to
come
to
the
fiesta
each
year
after
he
was
married
The
next
day
his
wife
came
in
from
Tafalla
to
be
with
the
body
and
the
day
after
there
was
a
service
in
the
chapel
of
San
Fermin
and
the
coffin
was
carried
to
the
railway-station
by
members
of
the
dancing
and
drinking
society
of
Tafalla
The
drums
marched
ahead
and
there
was
music
on
the
fifes
and
behind
the
men
who
carried
the
coffin
walked
the
wife
and
two
children
Behind
them
marched
all
the
members
of
the
dancing
and
drinking
societies
of
Pamplona
Estella
Tafalla
and
Sanguesa
who
could
stay
over
for
the
funeral
The
coffin
was
loaded
into
the
baggage-car
of
the
train
and
the
widow
and
the
two
children
rode
sitting
all
three
together
in
an
open
third-class
railway-carriage
The
train
started
with
a
jerk
and
then
ran
smoothly
going
down
grade
around
the
edge
of
the
plateau
and
out
into
the
fields
of
grain
that
blew
in
the
wind
on
the
plain
on
the
way
to
Tafalla
The
bull
who
killed
Vicente
Girones
was
named
Bocanegra
was
Number
118
of
the
bull-breeding
establishment
of
Sanchez
Tabemo
and
was
killed
by
Pedro
Romero
as
the
third
bull
of
that
same
afternoon
His
ear
was
cut
by
popular
acclamation
and
given
to
Pedro
Romero
who
in
turn
gave
it
to
Brett
who
wrapped
it
in
a
handkerchief
belonging
to
myself
and
left
both
ear
and
handkerchief
along
with
a
number
of
Muratti
cigarette-stubs
shoved
far
back
in
the
drawer
of
the
bed-table
that
stood
beside
her
bed
in
the
Hotel
Montoya
in
Pamplona
Back
in
the
hotel
the
night
watchman
was
sitting
on
a
bench
inside
the
door
He
had
been
there
all
night
and
was
very
sleepy
He
stood
up
as
I
came
in
Three
of
the
waitresses
came
in
at
the
same
time
They
had
been
to
the
morning
show
at
the
bull-ring
They
went
up-stairs
laughing
I
followed
them
up-stairs
and
went
into
my
room
I
took
off
my
shoes
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
The
window
was
open
onto
the
balcony
and
the
sunlight
was
bright
in
the
room
I
did
not
feel
sleepy
It
must
have
been
half
past
three
o'clock
when
I
had
gone
to
bed
and
the
bands
had
waked
me
at
six
My
jaw
was
sore
on
both
sides
I
felt
it
with
my
thumb
and
fingers
That
damn
Cohn
He
should
have
hit
somebody
the
first
time
he
was
insulted
and
then
gone
away
He
was
so
sure
that
Brett
loved
him
He
was
going
to
stay
and
true
love
would
conquer
all
Some
one
knocked
on
the
door
Come
in
It
was
Bill
and
Mike
They
sat
down
on
the
bed
Some
encierro
Bill
said
Some
encierro
I
say
were
n't
you
there
Mike
asked
Ring
for
some
beer
Bill
What
a
morning
Bill
said
He
mopped
off
his
face
My
God
what
a
morning
And
here
's
old
Jake
Old
Jake
the
human
punching-bag
What
happened
inside
Good
God
Bill
said
what
happened
Mike
There
were
these
bulls
coming
in
Mike
said
Just
ahead
of
them
was
the
crowd
and
some
chap
tripped
and
brought
the
whole
lot
of
them
down
And
the
bulls
all
came
in
right
over
them
Bill
said
I
heard
them
yell
That
was
Edna
Bill
said
Chaps
kept
coming
out
and
waving
their
shirts
One
bull
went
along
the
barrera
and
hooked
everybody
over
They
took
about
twenty
chaps
to
the
infirmary
Mike
said
What
a
morning
Bill
said
The
damn
police
kept
arresting
chaps
that
wanted
to
go
and
commit
suicide
with
the
bulls
The
steers
took
them
in
in
the
end
Mike
said
It
took
about
an
hour
It
was
really
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Mike
objected
Oh
go
to
hell
Bill
said
You
've
been
in
the
war
It
was
two
hours
and
a
half
for
me
Where
's
that
beer
Mike
asked
What
did
you
do
with
the
lovely
Edna
We
took
her
home
just
now
She
's
gone
to
bed
How
did
she
like
it
Fine
We
told
her
it
was
just
like
that
every
morning
She
was
impressed
Mike
said
She
wanted
us
to
go
down
in
the
ring
too
Bill
said
She
likes
action
I
said
it
would
n't
be
fair
to
my
creditors
Mike
said
What
a
morning
Bill
said
And
what
a
night
How
's
your
jaw
Jake
Mike
asked
Sore
I
said
Bill
laughed
Why
did
n't
you
hit
him
with
a
chair
You
can
talk
Mike
said
He
'd
have
knocked
you
out
too
I
never
saw
him
hit
me
I
rather
think
I
saw
him
just
before
and
then
quite
suddenly
I
was
sitting
down
in
the
street
and
Jake
was
lying
under
a
table
Where
did
he
go
afterward
I
asked
Here
she
is
Mike
said
Here
's
the
beautiful
lady
with
the
beer
The
chambermaid
put
the
tray
with
the
beer-bottles
and
glasses
down
on
the
table
Now
bring
up
three
more
bottles
Mike
said
Where
did
Cohn
go
after
he
hit
me
I
asked
Bill
Do
n't
you
know
about
that
Mike
was
opening
a
beer-bottle
He
poured
the
beer
into
one
of
the
glasses
holding
the
glass
close
to
the
bottle
Really
Bill
asked
Why
he
went
in
and
found
Brett
and
the
bull-fighter
chap
in
the
bull-fighter
's
room
and
then
he
massacred
the
poor
bloody
bull-fighter
No
Yes
What
a
night
Bill
said
He
nearly
killed
the
poor
bloody
bull-fighter
Then
Cohn
wanted
to
take
Brett
away
Wanted
to
make
an
honest
woman
of
her
I
imagine
Damned
touching
scene
He
took
a
long
drink
of
the
beer
He
is
an
ass
What
happened
Brett
gave
him
what
for
She
told
him
off
I
think
she
was
rather
good
I
'll
bet
she
was
Bill
said
Then
Cohn
broke
down
and
cried
and
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
the
bull-fighter
fellow
He
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
Brett
too
I
know
He
shook
hands
with
me
Did
he
Well
they
were
n't
having
any
of
it
The
bull-fighter
fellow
was
rather
good
He
did
n't
say
much
but
he
kept
getting
up
and
getting
knocked
down
again
Cohn
could
n't
knock
him
out
It
must
have
been
damned
funny
Where
did
you
hear
all
this
Brett
I
saw
her
this
morning
What
happened
finally
It
seems
the
bull-fighter
fellow
was
sitting
on
the
bed
He
'd
been
knocked
down
about
fifteen
times
and
he
wanted
to
fight
some
more
Brett
held
him
and
would
n't
let
him
get
up
He
was
weak
but
Brett
could
n't
hold
him
and
he
got
up
Then
Cohn
said
he
would
n't
hit
him
again
Said
he
could
n't
do
it
Said
it
would
be
wicked
So
the
bull-fighter
chap
sort
of
rather
staggered
over
to
him
Cohn
went
back
against
the
wall
'So
you
wo
n't
hit
me
'No
said
Cohn
'I
'd
be
ashamed
to
So
the
bull-fighter
fellow
hit
him
just
as
hard
as
he
could
in
the
face
and
then
sat
down
on
the
floor
He
could
n't
get
up
Brett
said
Cohn
wanted
to
pick
him
up
and
carry
him
to
the
bed
He
said
if
Cohn
helped
him
he
'd
kill
him
and
he
'd
kill
him
anyway
this
morning
if
Cohn
was
n't
out
of
town
Cohn
was
crying
and
Brett
had
told
him
off
and
he
wanted
to
shake
hands
I
've
told
you
that
before
Tell
the
rest
Bill
said
It
seems
the
bull-fighter
chap
was
sitting
on
the
floor
He
was
waiting
to
get
strength
enough
to
get
up
and
hit
Cohn
again
Brett
was
n't
having
any
shaking
hands
and
Cohn
was
crying
and
telling
her
how
much
he
loved
her
and
she
was
telling
him
not
to
be
a
ruddy
ass
Then
Cohn
leaned
down
to
shake
hands
with
the
bull-fighter
fellow
No
hard
feelings
you
know
All
for
forgiveness
And
the
bull-fighter
chap
hit
him
in
the
face
again
That
's
quite
a
kid
Bill
said
He
ruined
Cohn
Mike
said
You
know
I
do
n't
think
Cohn
will
ever
want
to
knock
people
about
again
When
did
you
see
Brett
This
morning
She
came
in
to
get
some
things
She
's
looking
after
this
Romero
lad
He
poured
out
another
bottle
of
beer
Brett
's
rather
cut
up
But
she
loves
looking
after
people
That
's
how
we
came
to
go
off
together
She
was
looking
after
me
I
know
I
said
I
'm
rather
drunk
Mike
said
I
think
I
'll
stay
rather
drunk
This
is
all
awfully
amusing
but
it
's
not
too
pleasant
It
's
not
too
pleasant
for
me
He
drank
off
the
beer
I
gave
Brett
what
for
you
know
I
said
if
she
would
go
about
with
Jews
and
bull-fighters
and
such
people
she
must
expect
trouble
He
leaned
forward
I
say
Jake
do
you
mind
if
I
drink
that
bottle
of
yours
She
'll
bring
you
another
one
Please
I
said
I
was
n't
drinking
it
anyway
Mike
started
to
open
the
bottle
Would
you
mind
opening
it
I
pressed
up
the
wire
fastener
and
poured
it
for
him
You
know
Mike
went
on
Brett
was
rather
good
She
's
always
rather
good
I
gave
her
a
fearful
hiding
about
Jews
and
bull-fighters
and
all
those
sort
of
people
and
do
you
know
what
she
said
'Yes
I
've
had
such
a
hell
of
a
happy
life
with
the
British
aristocracy
He
took
a
drink
That
was
rather
good
Ashley
chap
she
got
the
title
from
was
a
sailor
you
know
Ninth
baronet
When
he
came
home
he
would
n't
sleep
in
a
bed
Always
made
Brett
sleep
on
the
floor
Finally
when
he
got
really
bad
he
used
to
tell
her
he
'd
kill
her
Always
slept
with
a
loaded
service
revolver
Brett
used
to
take
the
shells
out
when
he
'd
gone
to
sleep
She
has
n't
had
an
absolutely
happy
life
Brett
Damned
shame
too
She
enjoys
things
so
He
stood
up
His
hand
was
shaky
I
'm
going
in
the
room
Try
and
get
a
little
sleep
He
smiled
We
go
too
long
without
sleep
in
these
fiestas
I
'm
going
to
start
now
and
get
plenty
of
sleep
Damn
bad
thing
not
to
get
sleep
Makes
you
frightfully
nervy
We
'll
see
you
at
noon
at
the
Iruña
Bill
said
Mike
went
out
the
door
We
heard
him
in
the
next
room
He
rang
the
bell
and
the
chambermaid
came
and
knocked
at
the
door
Bring
up
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
beer
and
a
bottle
of
Fundador
Mike
told
her
Si
Señorito
I
'm
going
to
bed
Bill
said
Poor
old
Mike
I
had
a
hell
of
a
row
about
him
last
night
Where
At
that
Milano
place
Yes
There
was
a
fellow
there
that
had
helped
pay
Brett
and
Mike
out
of
Cannes
once
He
was
damned
nasty
I
know
the
story
I
did
n't
Nobody
ought
to
have
a
right
to
say
things
about
Mike
That
's
what
makes
it
bad
They
ought
n't
to
have
any
right
I
wish
to
hell
they
did
n't
have
any
right
I
'm
going
to
bed
Was
anybody
killed
in
the
ring
I
do
n't
think
so
Just
badly
hurt
A
man
was
killed
outside
in
the
runway
Was
there
said
Bill
At
noon
we
were
all
at
the
café
It
was
crowded
We
were
eating
shrimps
and
drinking
beer
The
town
was
crowded
Every
street
was
full
Big
motor-cars
from
Biarritz
and
San
Sebastian
kept
driving
up
and
parking
around
the
square
They
brought
people
for
the
bull-fight
Sight-seeing
cars
came
up
too
There
was
one
with
twenty-five
Englishwomen
in
it
They
sat
in
the
big
white
car
and
looked
through
their
glasses
at
the
fiesta
The
dancers
were
all
quite
drunk
It
was
the
last
day
of
the
fiesta
The
fiesta
was
solid
and
unbroken
but
the
motor-cars
and
tourist-cars
made
little
islands
of
onlookers
When
the
cars
emptied
the
onlookers
were
absorbed
into
the
crowd
You
did
not
see
them
again
except
as
sport
clothes
odd-looking
at
a
table
among
the
closely
packed
peasants
in
black
smocks
The
fiesta
absorbed
even
the
Biarritz
English
so
that
you
did
not
see
them
unless
you
passed
close
to
a
table
All
the
time
there
was
music
in
the
street
The
drums
kept
on
pounding
and
the
pipes
were
going
Inside
the
cafés
men
with
their
hands
gripping
the
table
or
on
each
other
's
shoulders
were
singing
the
hard-voiced
singing
Here
comes
Brett
Bill
said
I
looked
and
saw
her
coming
through
the
crowd
in
the
square
walking
her
head
up
as
though
the
fiesta
were
being
staged
in
her
honor
and
she
found
it
pleasant
and
amusing
Hello
you
chaps
she
said
I
say
I
have
a
thirst
Get
another
big
beer
Bill
said
to
the
waiter
Shrimps
Is
Cohn
gone
Brett
asked
Yes
Bill
said
He
hired
a
car
The
beer
came
Brett
started
to
lift
the
glass
mug
and
her
hand
shook
She
saw
it
and
smiled
and
leaned
forward
and
took
a
long
sip
Good
beer
Very
good
I
said
I
was
nervous
about
Mike
I
did
not
think
he
had
slept
He
must
have
been
drinking
all
the
time
but
he
seemed
to
be
under
control
I
heard
Cohn
had
hurt
you
Jake
Brett
said
No
Knocked
me
out
That
was
all
I
say
he
did
hurt
Pedro
Romero
Brett
said
He
hurt
him
most
badly
How
is
he
He
'll
be
all
right
He
wo
n't
go
out
of
the
room
Does
he
look
badly
Very
He
was
really
hurt
I
told
him
I
wanted
to
pop
out
and
see
you
chaps
for
a
minute
Is
he
going
to
fight
Rather
I
'm
going
with
you
if
you
do
n't
mind
How
's
your
boy
friend
Mike
asked
He
had
not
listened
to
anything
that
Brett
had
said
Brett
's
got
a
bull-fighter
he
said
She
had
a
Jew
named
Cohn
but
he
turned
out
badly
Brett
stood
up
I
am
not
going
to
listen
to
that
sort
of
rot
from
you
Michael
How
's
your
boy
friend
Damned
well
Brett
said
Watch
him
this
afternoon
Brett
's
got
a
bull-fighter
Mike
said
A
beautiful
bloody
bull-fighter
Would
you
mind
walking
over
with
me
I
want
to
talk
to
you
Jake
Tell
him
all
about
your
bull-fighter
Mike
said
Oh
to
hell
with
your
bull-fighter
He
tipped
the
table
so
that
all
the
beers
and
the
dish
of
shrimps
went
over
in
a
crash
Come
on
Brett
said
Let
's
get
out
of
this
In
the
crowd
crossing
the
square
I
said
How
is
it
I
'm
not
going
to
see
him
after
lunch
until
the
fight
His
people
come
in
and
dress
him
They
're
very
angry
about
me
he
says
Brett
was
radiant
She
was
happy
The
sun
was
out
and
the
day
was
bright
I
feel
altogether
changed
Brett
said
You
've
no
idea
Jake
Anything
you
want
me
to
do
No
just
go
to
the
fight
with
me
We
'll
see
you
at
lunch
No
I
'm
eating
with
him
We
were
standing
under
the
arcade
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
They
were
carrying
tables
out
and
setting
them
up
under
the
arcade
Want
to
take
a
turn
out
to
the
park
Brett
asked
I
do
n't
want
to
go
up
yet
I
fancy
he
's
sleeping
We
walked
along
past
the
theatre
and
out
of
the
square
and
along
through
the
barracks
of
the
fair
moving
with
the
crowd
between
the
lines
of
booths
We
came
out
on
a
cross-street
that
led
to
the
Paseo
de
Sarasate
We
could
see
the
crowd
walking
there
all
the
fashionably
dressed
people
They
were
making
the
turn
at
the
upper
end
of
the
park
Do
n't
let
's
go
there
Brett
said
I
do
n't
want
staring
at
just
now
We
stood
in
the
sunlight
It
was
hot
and
good
after
the
rain
and
the
clouds
from
the
sea
I
hope
the
wind
goes
down
Brett
said
It
's
very
bad
for
him
So
do
I
He
says
the
bulls
are
all
right
They
're
good
Is
that
San
Fermin
's
Brett
looked
at
the
yellow
wall
of
the
chapel
Yes
Where
the
show
started
on
Sunday
Let
's
go
in
Do
you
mind
I
'd
rather
like
to
pray
a
little
for
him
or
something
We
went
in
through
the
heavy
leather
door
that
moved
very
lightly
It
was
dark
inside
Many
people
were
praying
You
saw
them
as
your
eyes
adjusted
themselves
to
the
half-light
We
knelt
at
one
of
the
long
wooden
benches
After
a
little
I
felt
Brett
stiffen
beside
me
and
saw
she
was
looking
straight
ahead
Come
on
she
whispered
throatily
Let
's
get
out
of
here
Makes
me
damned
nervous
Outside
in
the
hot
brightness
of
the
street
Brett
looked
up
at
the
tree-tops
in
the
wind
The
praying
had
not
been
much
of
a
success
Do
n't
know
why
I
get
so
nervy
in
church
Brett
said
Never
does
me
any
good
We
walked
along
I
'm
damned
bad
for
a
religious
atmosphere
Brett
said
I
've
the
wrong
type
of
face
You
know
Brett
said
I
'm
not
worried
about
him
at
all
I
just
feel
happy
about
him
Good
I
wish
the
wind
would
drop
though
It
's
liable
to
go
down
by
five
o'clock
Let
's
hope
You
might
pray
I
laughed
Never
does
me
any
good
I
've
never
gotten
anything
I
prayed
for
Have
you
Oh
yes
Oh
rot
said
Brett
Maybe
it
works
for
some
people
though
You
do
n't
look
very
religious
Jake
I
'm
pretty
religious
Oh
rot
said
Brett
Do
n't
start
proselyting
to-day
To-day
's
going
to
be
bad
enough
as
it
is
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
seen
her
in
the
old
happy
careless
way
since
before
she
went
off
with
Cohn
We
were
back
again
in
front
of
the
hotel
All
the
tables
were
set
now
and
already
several
were
filled
with
people
eating
Do
look
after
Mike
Brett
said
Do
n't
let
him
get
too
bad
Your
frients
haff
gone
up-stairs
the
German
maître
d'hôtel
said
in
English
He
was
a
continual
eavesdropper
Brett
turned
to
him
Thank
you
so
much
Have
you
anything
else
to
say
No
ma'am
Good
said
Brett
Save
us
a
table
for
three
I
said
to
the
German
He
smiled
his
dirty
little
pink-and-white
smile
Iss
madam
eating
here
No
Brett
said
Den
I
think
a
tabul
for
two
will
be
enuff
Do
n't
talk
to
him
Brett
said
Mike
must
have
been
in
bad
shape
she
said
on
the
stairs
We
passed
Montoya
on
the
stairs
He
bowed
and
did
not
smile
I
'll
see
you
at
the
café
Brett
said
Thank
you
so
much
Jake
We
had
stopped
at
the
floor
our
rooms
were
on
She
went
straight
down
the
hall
and
into
Romero
's
room
She
did
not
knock
She
simply
opened
the
door
went
in
and
closed
it
behind
her
I
stood
in
front
of
the
door
of
Mike
's
room
and
knocked
There
was
no
answer
I
tried
the
knob
and
it
opened
Inside
the
room
was
in
great
disorder
All
the
bags
were
opened
and
clothing
was
strewn
around
There
were
empty
bottles
beside
the
bed
Mike
lay
on
the
bed
looking
like
a
death
mask
of
himself
He
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
Hello
Jake
he
said
very
slowly
I
'm
getting
a
lit
tle
sleep
I
've
want
ed
a
lit
tle
sleep
for
a
long
time
Let
me
cover
you
over
No
I
'm
quite
warm
Do
n't
go
I
have
n't
got
ten
to
sleep
yet
You
'll
sleep
Mike
Do
n't
worry
boy
Brett
's
got
a
bull-fighter
Mike
said
But
her
Jew
has
gone
away
He
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
me
Damned
good
thing
what
Yes
Now
go
to
sleep
Mike
You
ought
to
get
some
sleep
I
'm
just
start
ing
I
'm
go
ing
to
get
a
lit
tle
sleep
He
shut
his
eyes
I
went
out
of
the
room
and
turned
the
door
to
quietly
Bill
was
in
my
room
reading
the
paper
See
Mike
Yes
Let
's
go
and
eat
I
wo
n't
eat
down-stairs
with
that
German
head
waiter
He
was
damned
snotty
when
I
was
getting
Mike
up-stairs
He
was
snotty
to
us
too
Let
's
go
out
and
eat
in
the
town
We
went
down
the
stairs
On
the
stairs
we
passed
a
girl
coming
up
with
a
covered
tray
There
goes
Brett
's
lunch
Bill
said
And
the
kid
's
I
said
Outside
on
the
terrace
under
the
arcade
the
German
head
waiter
came
up
His
red
cheeks
were
shiny
He
was
being
polite
I
haff
a
tabul
for
two
for
you
gentlemen
he
said
Go
sit
at
it
Bill
said
We
went
on
out
across
the
street
We
ate
at
a
restaurant
in
a
side
street
off
the
square
They
were
all
men
eating
in
the
restaurant
It
was
full
of
smoke
and
drinking
and
singing
The
food
was
good
and
so
was
the
wine
We
did
not
talk
much
Afterward
we
went
to
the
café
and
watched
the
fiesta
come
to
the
boiling-point
Brett
came
over
soon
after
lunch
She
said
she
had
looked
in
the
room
and
that
Mike
was
asleep
When
the
fiesta
boiled
over
and
toward
the
bull-ring
we
went
with
the
crowd
Brett
sat
at
the
ringside
between
Bill
and
me
Directly
below
us
was
the
callejon
the
passageway
between
the
stands
and
the
red
fence
of
the
barrera
Behind
us
the
concrete
stands
filled
solidly
Out
in
front
beyond
the
red
fence
the
sand
of
the
ring
was
smooth-rolled
and
yellow
It
looked
a
little
heavy
from
the
rain
but
it
was
dry
in
the
sun
and
firm
and
smooth
The
sword-handlers
and
bull-ring
servants
came
down
the
callejon
carrying
on
their
shoulders
the
wicker
baskets
of
fighting
capes
and
muletas
They
were
bloodstained
and
compactly
folded
and
packed
in
the
baskets
The
sword-handlers
opened
the
heavy
leather
sword-cases
so
the
red
wrapped
hilts
of
the
sheaf
of
swords
showed
as
the
leather
case
leaned
against
the
fence
They
unfolded
the
dark-stained
red
flannel
of
the
muletas
and
fixed
batons
in
them
to
spread
the
stuff
and
give
the
matador
something
to
hold
Brett
watched
it
all
She
was
absorbed
in
the
professional
details
He
's
his
name
stencilled
on
all
the
capes
and
muletas
she
said
Why
do
they
call
them
muletas
I
do
n't
know
I
wonder
if
they
ever
launder
them
I
do
n't
think
so
It
might
spoil
the
color
The
blood
must
stiffen
them
Bill
said
Funny
Brett
said
How
one
does
n't
mind
the
blood
Below
in
the
narrow
passage
of
the
callejon
the
sword-handlers
arranged
everything
All
the
seats
were
full
Above
all
the
boxes
were
full
There
was
not
an
empty
seat
except
in
the
President
's
box
When
he
came
in
the
fight
would
start
Across
the
smooth
sand
in
the
high
doorway
that
led
into
the
corrals
the
bull-fighters
were
standing
their
arms
furled
in
their
capes
talking
waiting
for
the
signal
to
march
in
across
the
arena
Brett
was
watching
them
with
the
glasses
Here
would
you
like
to
look
I
looked
through
the
glasses
and
saw
the
three
matadors
Romero
was
in
the
centre
Belmonte
on
his
left
Marcial
on
his
right
Back
of
them
were
their
people
and
behind
the
banderilleros
back
in
the
passageway
and
in
the
open
space
of
the
corral
I
saw
the
picadors
Romero
was
wearing
a
black
suit
His
tricornered
hat
was
low
down
over
his
eyes
I
could
not
see
his
face
clearly
under
the
hat
but
it
looked
badly
marked
He
was
looking
straight
ahead
Marcial
was
smoking
a
cigarette
guardedly
holding
it
in
his
hand
Belmonte
looked
ahead
his
face
wan
and
yellow
his
long
wolf
jaw
out
He
was
looking
at
nothing
Neither
he
nor
Romero
seemed
to
have
anything
in
common
with
the
others
They
were
all
alone
The
President
came
in
there
was
handclapping
above
us
in
the
grand
stand
and
I
handed
the
glasses
to
Brett
There
was
applause
The
music
started
Brett
looked
through
the
glasses
Here
take
them
she
said
Through
the
glasses
I
saw
Belmonte
speak
to
Romero
Marcial
straightened
up
and
dropped
his
cigarette
and
looking
straight
ahead
their
heads
back
their
free
arms
swinging
the
three
matadors
walked
out
Behind
them
came
all
the
procession
opening
out
all
striding
in
step
all
the
capes
furled
everybody
with
free
arms
swinging
and
behind
rode
the
picadors
their
pics
rising
like
lances
Behind
all
came
the
two
trains
of
mules
and
the
bull-ring
servants
The
matadors
bowed
holding
their
hats
on
before
the
President
's
box
and
then
came
over
to
the
barrera
below
us
Pedro
Romero
took
off
his
heavy
gold-brocaded
cape
and
handed
it
over
the
fence
to
his
sword-handler
He
said
something
to
the
sword-handler
Close
below
us
we
saw
Romero
's
lips
were
puffed
both
eyes
were
discolored
His
face
was
discolored
and
swollen
The
sword-handler
took
the
cape
looked
up
at
Brett
and
came
over
to
us
and
handed
up
the
cape
Spread
it
out
in
front
of
you
I
said
Brett
leaned
forward
The
cape
was
heavy
and
smoothly
stiff
with
gold
The
sword-handler
looked
back
shook
his
head
and
said
something
A
man
beside
me
leaned
over
toward
Brett
He
does
n't
want
you
to
spread
it
he
said
You
should
fold
it
and
keep
it
in
your
lap
Brett
folded
the
heavy
cape
Romero
did
not
look
up
at
us
He
was
speaking
to
Belmonte
Belmonte
had
sent
his
formal
cape
over
to
some
friends
He
looked
across
at
them
and
smiled
his
wolf
smile
that
was
only
with
the
mouth
Romero
leaned
over
the
barrera
and
asked
for
the
water-jug
The
sword-handler
brought
it
and
Romero
poured
water
over
the
percale
of
his
fighting-cape
and
then
scuffed
the
lower
folds
in
the
sand
with
his
slippered
foot
What
's
that
for
Brett
asked
To
give
it
weight
in
the
wind
His
face
looks
bad
Bill
said
He
feels
very
badly
Brett
said
He
should
be
in
bed
The
first
bull
was
Belmonte
's
Belmonte
was
very
good
But
because
he
got
thirty
thousand
pesetas
and
people
had
stayed
in
line
all
night
to
buy
tickets
to
see
him
the
crowd
demanded
that
he
should
be
more
than
very
good
Belmonte
's
great
attraction
is
working
close
to
the
bull
In
bull-fighting
they
speak
of
the
terrain
of
the
bull
and
the
terrain
of
the
bull-fighter
As
long
as
a
bull-fighter
stays
in
his
own
terrain
he
is
comparatively
safe
Each
time
he
enters
into
the
terrain
of
the
bull
he
is
in
great
danger
Belmonte
in
his
best
days
worked
always
in
the
terrain
of
the
bull
This
way
he
gave
the
sensation
of
coming
tragedy
People
went
to
the
corrida
to
see
Belmonte
to
be
given
tragic
sensations
and
perhaps
to
see
the
death
of
Belmonte
Fifteen
years
ago
they
said
if
you
wanted
to
see
Belmonte
you
should
go
quickly
while
he
was
still
alive
Since
then
he
has
killed
more
than
a
thousand
bulls
When
he
retired
the
legend
grew
up
about
how
his
bull-fighting
had
been
and
when
he
came
out
of
retirement
the
public
were
disappointed
because
no
real
man
could
work
as
close
to
the
bulls
as
Belmonte
was
supposed
to
have
done
not
of
course
even
Belmonte
Also
Belmonte
imposed
conditions
and
insisted
that
his
bulls
should
not
be
too
large
nor
too
dangerously
armed
with
horns
and
so
the
element
that
was
necessary
to
give
the
sensation
of
tragedy
was
not
there
and
the
public
who
wanted
three
times
as
much
from
Belmonte
who
was
sick
with
a
fistula
as
Belmonte
had
ever
been
able
to
give
felt
defrauded
and
cheated
and
Belmonte
's
jaw
came
further
out
in
contempt
and
his
face
turned
yellower
and
he
moved
with
greater
difficulty
as
his
pain
increased
and
finally
the
crowd
were
actively
against
him
and
he
was
utterly
contemptuous
and
indifferent
He
had
meant
to
have
a
great
afternoon
and
instead
it
was
an
afternoon
of
sneers
shouted
insults
and
finally
a
volley
of
cushions
and
pieces
of
bread
and
vegetables
thrown
down
at
him
in
the
plaza
where
he
had
had
his
greatest
triumphs
His
jaw
only
went
further
out
Sometimes
he
turned
to
smile
that
toothed
long-jawed
lipless
smile
when
he
was
called
something
particularly
insulting
and
always
the
pain
that
any
movement
produced
grew
stronger
and
stronger
until
finally
his
yellow
face
was
parchment
color
and
after
his
second
bull
was
dead
and
the
throwing
of
bread
and
cushions
was
over
after
he
had
saluted
the
President
with
the
same
wolf-jawed
smile
and
contemptuous
eyes
and
handed
his
sword
over
the
barrera
to
be
wiped
and
put
back
in
its
case
he
passed
through
into
the
callejon
and
leaned
on
the
barrera
below
us
his
head
on
his
arms
not
seeing
not
hearing
anything
only
going
through
his
pain
When
he
looked
up
finally
he
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
He
swallowed
a
little
rinsed
his
mouth
spat
the
water
took
his
cape
and
went
back
into
the
ring
Because
they
were
against
Belmonte
the
public
were
for
Romero
From
the
moment
he
left
the
barrera
and
went
toward
the
bull
they
applauded
him
Belmonte
watched
Romero
too
watched
him
always
without
seeming
to
He
paid
no
attention
to
Marcial
Marcial
was
