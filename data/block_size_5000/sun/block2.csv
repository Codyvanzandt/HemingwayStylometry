a
fool
You
've
got
to
take
that
back
Oh
cut
out
the
prep-school
stuff
Take
it
back
Sure
Anything
I
never
heard
of
Brett
Ashley
How
's
that
No
Not
that
About
me
going
to
hell
Oh
do
n't
go
to
hell
I
said
Stick
around
We
're
just
starting
lunch
Cohn
smiled
again
and
sat
down
He
seemed
glad
to
sit
down
What
the
hell
would
he
have
done
if
he
had
n't
sat
down
You
say
such
damned
insulting
things
Jake
I
'm
sorry
I
've
got
a
nasty
tongue
I
never
mean
it
when
I
say
nasty
things
I
know
it
Cohn
said
You
're
really
about
the
best
friend
I
have
Jake
God
help
you
I
thought
Forget
what
I
said
I
said
out
loud
I
'm
sorry
It
's
all
right
It
's
fine
I
was
just
sore
for
a
minute
Good
Let
's
get
something
else
to
eat
After
we
finished
the
lunch
we
walked
up
to
the
Café
de
la
Paix
and
had
coffee
I
could
feel
Cohn
wanted
to
bring
up
Brett
again
but
I
held
him
off
it
We
talked
about
one
thing
and
another
and
I
left
him
to
come
to
the
office
At
five
o'clock
I
was
in
the
Hotel
Crillon
waiting
for
Brett
She
was
not
there
so
I
sat
down
and
wrote
some
letters
They
were
not
very
good
letters
but
I
hoped
their
being
on
Crillon
stationery
would
help
them
Brett
did
not
turn
up
so
about
quarter
to
six
I
went
down
to
the
bar
and
had
a
Jack
Rose
with
George
the
barman
Brett
had
not
been
in
the
bar
either
and
so
I
looked
for
her
up-stairs
on
my
way
out
and
took
a
taxi
to
the
Café
Select
Crossing
the
Seine
I
saw
a
string
of
barges
being
towed
empty
down
the
current
riding
high
the
bargemen
at
the
sweeps
as
they
came
toward
the
bridge
The
river
looked
nice
It
was
always
pleasant
crossing
bridges
in
Paris
The
taxi
rounded
the
statue
of
the
inventor
of
the
semaphore
engaged
in
doing
same
and
turned
up
the
Boulevard
Raspail
and
I
sat
back
to
let
that
part
of
the
ride
pass
The
Boulevard
Raspail
always
made
dull
riding
It
was
like
a
certain
stretch
on
the
P
L
M
between
Fontainebleau
and
Montereau
that
always
made
me
feel
bored
and
dead
and
dull
until
it
was
over
I
suppose
it
is
some
association
of
ideas
that
makes
those
dead
places
in
a
journey
There
are
other
streets
in
Paris
as
ugly
as
the
Boulevard
Raspail
It
is
a
street
I
do
not
mind
walking
down
at
all
But
I
can
not
stand
to
ride
along
it
Perhaps
I
had
read
something
about
it
once
That
was
the
way
Robert
Cohn
was
about
all
of
Paris
I
wondered
where
Cohn
got
that
incapacity
to
enjoy
Paris
Possibly
from
Mencken
Mencken
hates
Paris
I
believe
So
many
young
men
get
their
likes
and
dislikes
from
Mencken
The
taxi
stopped
in
front
of
the
Rotonde
No
matter
what
café
in
Montparnasse
you
ask
a
taxi-driver
to
bring
you
to
from
the
right
bank
of
the
river
they
always
take
you
to
the
Rotonde
Ten
years
from
now
it
will
probably
be
the
Dome
It
was
near
enough
anyway
I
walked
past
the
sad
tables
of
the
Rotonde
to
the
Select
There
were
a
few
people
inside
at
the
bar
and
outside
alone
sat
Harvey
Stone
He
had
a
pile
of
saucers
in
front
of
him
and
he
needed
a
shave
Sit
down
said
Harvey
I
've
been
looking
for
you
What
's
the
matter
Nothing
Just
looking
for
you
Been
out
to
the
races
No
Not
since
Sunday
What
do
you
hear
from
the
States
Nothing
Absolutely
nothing
What
's
the
matter
I
do
n't
know
I
'm
through
with
them
I
'm
absolutely
through
with
them
He
leaned
forward
and
looked
me
in
the
eye
Do
you
want
to
know
something
Jake
Yes
I
have
n't
had
anything
to
eat
for
five
days
I
figured
rapidly
back
in
my
mind
It
was
three
days
ago
that
Harvey
had
won
two
hundred
francs
from
me
shaking
poker
dice
in
the
New
York
Bar
What
's
the
matter
No
money
Money
has
n't
come
he
paused
I
tell
you
it
's
strange
Jake
When
I
'm
like
this
I
just
want
to
be
alone
I
want
to
stay
in
my
own
room
I
'm
like
a
cat
I
felt
in
my
pocket
Would
a
hundred
help
you
any
Harvey
Yes
Come
on
Let
's
go
and
eat
There
's
no
hurry
Have
a
drink
Better
eat
No
When
I
get
like
this
I
do
n't
care
whether
I
eat
or
not
We
had
a
drink
Harvey
added
my
saucer
to
his
own
pile
Do
you
know
Mencken
Harvey
Yes
Why
What
's
he
like
He
's
all
right
He
says
some
pretty
funny
things
Last
time
I
had
dinner
with
him
we
talked
about
Hoffenheimer
'The
trouble
is
he
said
'he
's
a
garter
snapper
That
's
not
bad
That
's
not
bad
He
's
through
now
Harvey
went
on
He
's
written
about
all
the
things
he
knows
and
now
he
's
on
all
the
things
he
does
n't
know
I
guess
he
's
all
right
I
said
I
just
ca
n't
read
him
Oh
nobody
reads
him
now
Harvey
said
except
the
people
that
used
to
read
the
Alexander
Hamilton
Institute
Well
I
said
That
was
a
good
thing
too
Sure
said
Harvey
So
we
sat
and
thought
deeply
for
a
while
Have
another
port
All
right
said
Harvey
There
comes
Cohn
I
said
Robert
Cohn
was
crossing
the
street
That
moron
said
Harvey
Cohn
came
up
to
our
table
Hello
you
bums
he
said
Hello
Robert
Harvey
said
I
was
just
telling
Jake
here
that
you
're
a
moron
What
do
you
mean
Tell
us
right
off
Do
n't
think
What
would
you
rather
do
if
you
could
do
anything
you
wanted
Cohn
started
to
consider
Do
n't
think
Bring
it
right
out
I
do
n't
know
Cohn
said
What
's
it
all
about
anyway
I
mean
what
would
you
rather
do
What
comes
into
your
head
first
No
matter
how
silly
it
is
I
do
n't
know
Cohn
said
I
think
I
'd
rather
play
football
again
with
what
I
know
about
handling
myself
now
I
misjudged
you
Harvey
said
You
're
not
a
moron
You
're
only
a
case
of
arrested
development
You
're
awfully
funny
Harvey
Cohn
said
Some
day
somebody
will
push
your
face
in
Harvey
Stone
laughed
You
think
so
They
wo
n't
though
Because
it
would
n't
make
any
difference
to
me
I
'm
not
a
fighter
It
would
make
a
difference
to
you
if
anybody
did
it
No
it
would
n't
That
's
where
you
make
your
big
mistake
Because
you
're
not
intelligent
Cut
it
out
about
me
Sure
said
Harvey
It
does
n't
make
any
difference
to
me
You
do
n't
mean
anything
to
me
Come
on
Harvey
I
said
Have
another
porto
No
he
said
I
'm
going
up
the
street
and
eat
See
you
later
Jake
He
walked
out
and
up
the
street
I
watched
him
crossing
the
street
through
the
taxis
small
heavy
slowly
sure
of
himself
in
the
traffic
He
always
gets
me
sore
Cohn
said
I
ca
n't
stand
him
I
like
him
I
said
I
'm
fond
of
him
You
do
n't
want
to
get
sore
at
him
I
know
it
Cohn
said
He
just
gets
on
my
nerves
Write
this
afternoon
No
I
could
n't
get
it
going
It
's
harder
to
do
than
my
first
book
I
'm
having
a
hard
time
handling
it
The
sort
of
healthy
conceit
that
he
had
when
he
returned
from
America
early
in
the
spring
was
gone
Then
he
had
been
sure
of
his
work
only
with
these
personal
longings
for
adventure
Now
the
sureness
was
gone
Somehow
I
feel
I
have
not
shown
Robert
Cohn
clearly
The
reason
is
that
until
he
fell
in
love
with
Brett
I
never
heard
him
make
one
remark
that
would
in
any
way
detach
him
from
other
people
He
was
nice
to
watch
on
the
tennis-court
he
had
a
good
body
and
he
kept
it
in
shape
he
handled
his
cards
well
at
bridge
and
he
had
a
funny
sort
of
undergraduate
quality
about
him
If
he
were
in
a
crowd
nothing
he
said
stood
out
He
wore
what
used
to
be
called
polo
shirts
at
school
and
may
be
called
that
still
but
he
was
not
professionally
youthful
I
do
not
believe
he
thought
about
his
clothes
much
Externally
he
had
been
formed
at
Princeton
Internally
he
had
been
moulded
by
the
two
women
who
had
trained
him
He
had
a
nice
boyish
sort
of
cheerfulness
that
had
never
been
trained
out
of
him
and
I
probably
have
not
brought
it
out
He
loved
to
win
at
tennis
He
probably
loved
to
win
as
much
as
Lenglen
for
instance
On
the
other
hand
he
was
not
angry
at
being
beaten
When
he
fell
in
love
with
Brett
his
tennis
game
went
all
to
pieces
People
beat
him
who
had
never
had
a
chance
with
him
He
was
very
nice
about
it
Anyhow
we
were
sitting
on
the
terrace
of
the
Café
Select
and
Harvey
Stone
had
just
crossed
the
street
Come
on
up
to
the
Lilas
I
said
I
have
a
date
What
time
Frances
is
coming
here
at
seven-fifteen
There
she
is
Frances
Clyne
was
coming
toward
us
from
across
the
street
She
was
a
very
tall
girl
who
walked
with
a
great
deal
of
movement
She
waved
and
smiled
We
watched
her
cross
the
street
Hello
she
said
I
'm
so
glad
you
're
here
Jake
I
've
been
wanting
to
talk
to
you
Hello
Frances
said
Cohn
He
smiled
Why
hello
Robert
Are
you
here
She
went
on
talking
rapidly
I
've
had
the
darndest
time
This
one
shaking
her
head
at
Cohn
did
n't
come
home
for
lunch
I
was
n't
supposed
to
Oh
I
know
But
you
did
n't
say
anything
about
it
to
the
cook
Then
I
had
a
date
myself
and
Paula
was
n't
at
her
office
I
went
to
the
Ritz
and
waited
for
her
and
she
never
came
and
of
course
I
did
n't
have
enough
money
to
lunch
at
the
Ritz
What
did
you
do
Oh
went
out
of
course
She
spoke
in
a
sort
of
imitation
joyful
manner
I
always
keep
my
appointments
No
one
keeps
theirs
nowadays
I
ought
to
know
better
How
are
you
Jake
anyway
Fine
That
was
a
fine
girl
you
had
at
the
dance
and
then
went
off
with
that
Brett
one
Do
n't
you
like
her
Cohn
asked
I
think
she
's
perfectly
charming
Do
n't
you
Cohn
said
nothing
Look
Jake
I
want
to
talk
with
you
Would
you
come
over
with
me
to
the
Dome
You
'll
stay
here
wo
n't
you
Robert
Come
on
Jake
We
crossed
the
Boulevard
Montparnasse
and
sat
down
at
a
table
A
boy
came
up
with
the
Paris
Times
and
I
bought
one
and
opened
it
What
's
the
matter
Frances
Oh
nothing
she
said
except
that
he
wants
to
leave
me
How
do
you
mean
Oh
he
told
every
one
that
we
were
going
to
be
married
and
I
told
my
mother
and
every
one
and
now
he
does
n't
want
to
do
it
What
's
the
matter
He
's
decided
he
has
n't
lived
enough
I
knew
it
would
happen
when
he
went
to
New
York
She
looked
up
very
bright-eyed
and
trying
to
talk
inconsequentially
I
would
n't
marry
him
if
he
does
n't
want
to
Of
course
I
would
n't
I
would
n't
marry
him
now
for
anything
But
it
does
seem
to
me
to
be
a
little
late
now
after
we
've
waited
three
years
and
I
've
just
gotten
my
divorce
I
said
nothing
We
were
going
to
celebrate
so
and
instead
we
've
just
had
scenes
It
's
so
childish
We
have
dreadful
scenes
and
he
cries
and
begs
me
to
be
reasonable
but
he
says
he
just
ca
n't
do
it
It
's
rotten
luck
I
should
say
it
is
rotten
luck
I
've
wasted
two
years
and
a
half
on
him
now
And
I
do
n't
know
now
if
any
man
will
ever
want
to
marry
me
Two
years
ago
I
could
have
married
anybody
I
wanted
down
at
Cannes
All
the
old
ones
that
wanted
to
marry
somebody
chic
and
settle
down
were
crazy
about
me
Now
I
do
n't
think
I
could
get
anybody
Sure
you
could
marry
anybody
No
I
do
n't
believe
it
And
I
'm
fond
of
him
too
And
I
'd
like
to
have
children
I
always
thought
we
'd
have
children
She
looked
at
me
very
brightly
I
never
liked
children
much
but
I
do
n't
want
to
think
I
'll
never
have
them
I
always
thought
I
'd
have
them
and
then
like
them
He
's
got
children
Oh
yes
He
's
got
children
and
he
's
got
money
and
he
's
got
a
rich
mother
and
he
's
written
a
book
and
nobody
will
publish
my
stuff
nobody
at
all
It
is
n't
bad
either
And
I
have
n't
got
any
money
at
all
I
could
have
had
alimony
but
I
got
the
divorce
the
quickest
way
She
looked
at
me
again
very
brightly
It
is
n't
right
It
's
my
own
fault
and
it
's
not
too
I
ought
to
have
known
better
And
when
I
tell
him
he
just
cries
and
says
he
ca
n't
marry
Why
ca
n't
he
marry
I
'd
be
a
good
wife
I
'm
easy
to
get
along
with
I
leave
him
alone
It
does
n't
do
any
good
It
's
a
rotten
shame
Yes
it
is
a
rotten
shame
But
there
's
no
use
talking
about
it
is
there
Come
on
let
's
go
back
to
the
café
And
of
course
there
is
n't
anything
I
can
do
No
Just
do
n't
let
him
know
I
talked
to
you
I
know
what
he
wants
Now
for
the
first
time
she
dropped
her
bright
terribly
cheerful
manner
He
wants
to
go
back
to
New
York
alone
and
be
there
when
his
book
comes
out
so
when
a
lot
of
little
chickens
like
it
That
's
what
he
wants
Maybe
they
wo
n't
like
it
I
do
n't
think
he
's
that
way
Really
You
do
n't
know
him
like
I
do
Jake
That
's
what
he
wants
to
do
I
know
it
I
know
it
That
's
why
he
does
n't
want
to
marry
He
wants
to
have
a
big
triumph
this
fall
all
by
himself
Want
to
go
back
to
the
café
Yes
Come
on
We
got
up
from
the
table
they
had
never
brought
us
a
drink
and
started
across
the
street
toward
the
Select
where
Cohn
sat
smiling
at
us
from
behind
the
marble-topped
table
Well
what
are
you
smiling
at
Frances
asked
him
Feel
pretty
happy
I
was
smiling
at
you
and
Jake
with
your
secrets
Oh
what
I
've
told
Jake
is
n't
any
secret
Everybody
will
know
it
soon
enough
I
only
wanted
to
give
Jake
a
decent
version
What
was
it
About
your
going
to
England
Yes
about
my
going
to
England
Oh
Jake
I
forgot
to
tell
you
I
'm
going
to
England
Is
n't
that
fine
Yes
that
's
the
way
it
's
done
in
the
very
best
families
Robert
's
sending
me
He
's
going
to
give
me
two
hundred
pounds
and
then
I
'm
going
to
visit
friends
Wo
n't
it
be
lovely
The
friends
do
n't
know
about
it
yet
She
turned
to
Cohn
and
smiled
at
him
He
was
not
smiling
now
You
were
only
going
to
give
me
a
hundred
pounds
were
n't
you
Robert
But
I
made
him
give
me
two
hundred
He
's
really
very
generous
Are
n't
you
Robert
I
do
not
know
how
people
could
say
such
terrible
things
to
Robert
Cohn
There
are
people
to
whom
you
could
not
say
insulting
things
They
give
you
a
feeling
that
the
world
would
be
destroyed
would
actually
be
destroyed
before
your
eyes
if
you
said
certain
things
But
here
was
Cohn
taking
it
all
Here
it
was
all
going
on
right
before
me
and
I
did
not
even
feel
an
impulse
to
try
and
stop
it
And
this
was
friendly
joking
to
what
went
on
later
How
can
you
say
such
things
Frances
Cohn
interrupted
Listen
to
him
I
'm
going
to
England
I
'm
going
to
visit
friends
Ever
visit
friends
that
did
n't
want
you
Oh
they
'll
have
to
take
me
all
right
'How
do
you
do
my
dear
Such
a
long
time
since
we
've
seen
you
And
how
is
your
dear
mother
Yes
how
is
my
dear
mother
She
put
all
her
money
into
French
war
bonds
Yes
she
did
Probably
the
only
person
in
the
world
that
did
'And
what
about
Robert
or
else
very
careful
talking
around
Robert
'You
must
be
most
careful
not
to
mention
him
my
dear
Poor
Frances
has
had
a
most
unfortunate
experience
Wo
n't
it
be
fun
Robert
Do
n't
you
think
it
will
be
fun
Jake
She
turned
to
me
with
that
terribly
bright
smile
It
was
very
satisfactory
to
her
to
have
an
audience
for
this
And
where
are
you
going
to
be
Robert
It
's
my
own
fault
all
right
Perfectly
my
own
fault
When
I
made
you
get
rid
of
your
little
secretary
on
the
magazine
I
ought
to
have
known
you
'd
get
rid
of
me
the
same
way
Jake
does
n't
know
about
that
Should
I
tell
him
Shut
up
Frances
for
God
's
sake
Yes
I
'll
tell
him
Robert
had
a
little
secretary
on
the
magazine
Just
the
sweetest
little
thing
in
the
world
and
he
thought
she
was
wonderful
and
then
I
came
along
and
he
thought
I
was
pretty
wonderful
too
So
I
made
him
get
rid
of
her
and
he
had
brought
her
to
Provincetown
from
Carmel
when
he
moved
the
magazine
and
he
did
n't
even
pay
her
fare
back
to
the
coast
All
to
please
me
He
thought
I
was
pretty
fine
then
Did
n't
you
Robert
You
must
n't
misunderstand
Jake
it
was
absolutely
platonic
with
the
secretary
Not
even
platonic
Nothing
at
all
really
It
was
just
that
she
was
so
nice
And
he
did
that
just
to
please
me
Well
I
suppose
that
we
that
live
by
the
sword
shall
perish
by
the
sword
Is
n't
that
literary
though
You
want
to
remember
that
for
your
next
book
Robert
You
know
Robert
is
going
to
get
material
for
a
new
book
Are
n't
you
Robert
That
's
why
he
's
leaving
me
He
's
decided
I
do
n't
film
well
You
see
he
was
so
busy
all
the
time
that
we
were
living
together
writing
on
this
book
that
he
does
n't
remember
anything
about
us
So
now
he
's
going
out
and
get
some
new
material
Well
I
hope
he
gets
something
frightfully
interesting
Listen
Robert
dear
Let
me
tell
you
something
You
wo
n't
mind
will
you
Do
n't
have
scenes
with
your
young
ladies
Try
not
to
Because
you
ca
n't
have
scenes
without
crying
and
then
you
pity
yourself
so
much
you
ca
n't
remember
what
the
other
person
's
said
You
'll
never
be
able
to
remember
any
conversations
that
way
Just
try
and
be
calm
I
know
it
's
awfully
hard
But
remember
it
's
for
literature
We
all
ought
to
make
sacrifices
for
literature
Look
at
me
I
'm
going
to
England
without
a
protest
All
for
literature
We
must
all
help
young
writers
Do
n't
you
think
so
Jake
But
you
're
not
a
young
writer
Are
you
Robert
You
're
thirty-four
Still
I
suppose
that
is
young
for
a
great
writer
Look
at
Hardy
Look
at
Anatole
France
He
just
died
a
little
while
ago
Robert
does
n't
think
he
's
any
good
though
Some
of
his
French
friends
told
him
He
does
n't
read
French
very
well
himself
He
was
n't
a
good
writer
like
you
are
was
he
Robert
Do
you
think
he
ever
had
to
go
and
look
for
material
What
do
you
suppose
he
said
to
his
mistresses
when
he
would
n't
marry
them
I
wonder
if
he
cried
too
Oh
I
've
just
thought
of
something
She
put
her
gloved
hand
up
to
her
lips
I
know
the
real
reason
why
Robert
wo
n't
marry
me
Jake
It
's
just
come
to
me
They
've
sent
it
to
me
in
a
vision
in
the
Café
Select
Is
n't
it
mystic
Some
day
they
'll
put
a
tablet
up
Like
at
Lourdes
Do
you
want
to
hear
Robert
I
'll
tell
you
It
's
so
simple
I
wonder
why
I
never
thought
about
it
Why
you
see
Robert
's
always
wanted
to
have
a
mistress
and
if
he
does
n't
marry
me
why
then
he
's
had
one
She
was
his
mistress
for
over
two
years
See
how
it
is
And
if
he
marries
me
like
he
's
always
promised
he
would
that
would
be
the
end
of
all
the
romance
Do
n't
you
think
that
's
bright
of
me
to
figure
that
out
It
's
true
too
Look
at
him
and
see
if
it
's
not
Where
are
you
going
Jake
I
've
got
to
go
in
and
see
Harvey
Stone
a
minute
Cohn
looked
up
as
I
went
in
His
face
was
white
Why
did
he
sit
there
Why
did
he
keep
on
taking
it
like
that
As
I
stood
against
the
bar
looking
out
I
could
see
them
through
the
window
Frances
was
talking
on
to
him
smiling
brightly
looking
into
his
face
each
time
she
asked
Is
n't
it
so
Robert
Or
maybe
she
did
not
ask
that
now
Perhaps
she
said
something
else
I
told
the
barman
I
did
not
want
anything
to
drink
and
went
out
through
the
side
door
As
I
went
out
the
door
I
looked
back
through
the
two
thicknesses
of
glass
and
saw
them
sitting
there
She
was
still
talking
to
him
I
went
down
a
side
street
to
the
Boulevard
Raspail
A
taxi
came
along
and
I
got
in
and
gave
the
driver
the
address
of
my
flat
As
I
started
up
the
stairs
the
concierge
knocked
on
the
glass
of
the
door
of
her
lodge
and
as
I
stopped
she
came
out
She
had
some
letters
and
a
telegram
Here
is
the
post
And
there
was
a
lady
here
to
see
you
Did
she
leave
a
card
No
She
was
with
a
gentleman
It
was
the
one
who
was
here
last
night
In
the
end
I
find
she
is
very
nice
Was
she
with
a
friend
of
mine
I
do
n't
know
He
was
never
here
before
He
was
very
large
Very
very
large
She
was
very
nice
Very
very
nice
Last
night
she
was
perhaps
a
little
She
put
her
head
on
one
hand
and
rocked
it
up
and
down
I
'll
speak
perfectly
frankly
Monsieur
Barnes
Last
night
I
found
her
not
so
gentille
Last
night
I
formed
another
idea
of
her
But
listen
to
what
I
tell
you
She
is
très
très
gentille
She
is
of
very
good
family
It
is
a
thing
you
can
see
They
did
not
leave
any
word
Yes
They
said
they
would
be
back
in
an
hour
Send
them
up
when
they
come
Yes
Monsieur
Barnes
And
that
lady
that
lady
there
is
some
one
An
eccentric
perhaps
but
quelqu'une
quelqu'une
The
concierge
before
she
became
a
concierge
had
owned
a
drink-selling
concession
at
the
Paris
race-courses
Her
life-work
lay
in
the
pelouse
but
she
kept
an
eye
on
the
people
of
the
pesage
and
she
took
great
pride
in
telling
me
which
of
my
guests
were
well
brought
up
which
were
of
good
family
who
were
sportsmen
a
French
word
pronounced
with
the
accent
on
the
men
The
only
trouble
was
that
people
who
did
not
fall
into
any
of
those
three
categories
were
very
liable
to
be
told
there
was
no
one
home
chez
Barnes
One
of
my
friends
an
extremely
underfed-looking
painter
who
was
obviously
to
Madame
Duzinell
neither
well
brought
up
of
good
family
nor
a
sportsman
wrote
me
a
letter
asking
if
I
could
get
him
a
pass
to
get
by
the
concierge
so
he
could
come
up
and
see
me
occasionally
in
the
evenings
I
went
up
to
the
flat
wondering
what
Brett
had
done
to
the
concierge
The
wire
was
a
cable
from
Bill
Gorton
saying
he
was
arriving
on
the
France
I
put
the
mail
on
the
table
went
back
to
the
bedroom
undressed
and
had
a
shower
I
was
rubbing
down
when
I
heard
the
door-bell
pull
I
put
on
a
bathrobe
and
slippers
and
went
to
the
door
It
was
Brett
Back
of
her
was
the
count
He
was
holding
a
great
bunch
of
roses
Hello
darling
said
Brett
Are
n't
you
going
to
let
us
in
Come
on
I
was
just
bathing
Are
n't
you
the
fortunate
man
Bathing
Only
a
shower
Sit
down
Count
Mippipopolous
What
will
you
drink
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
like
flowers
sir
the
count
said
but
I
took
the
liberty
of
just
bringing
these
roses
Here
give
them
to
me
Brett
took
them
Get
me
some
water
in
this
Jake
I
filled
the
big
earthenware
jug
with
water
in
the
kitchen
and
Brett
put
the
roses
in
it
and
placed
them
in
the
centre
of
the
dining-room
table
I
say
We
have
had
a
day
You
do
n't
remember
anything
about
a
date
with
me
at
the
Crillon
No
Did
we
have
one
I
must
have
been
blind
You
were
quite
drunk
my
dear
said
the
count
Was
n't
I
though
And
the
count
's
been
a
brick
absolutely
You
've
got
hell
's
own
drag
with
the
concierge
now
I
ought
to
have
Gave
her
two
hundred
francs
Do
n't
be
a
damned
fool
His
she
said
and
nodded
at
the
count
I
thought
we
ought
to
give
her
a
little
something
for
last
night
It
was
very
late
He
's
wonderful
Brett
said
He
remembers
everything
that
's
happened
So
do
you
my
dear
Fancy
said
Brett
Who
'd
want
to
I
say
Jake
do
we
get
a
drink
You
get
it
while
I
go
in
and
dress
You
know
where
it
is
Rather
While
I
dressed
I
heard
Brett
put
down
glasses
and
then
a
siphon
and
then
heard
them
talking
I
dressed
slowly
sitting
on
the
bed
I
felt
tired
and
pretty
rotten
Brett
came
in
the
room
a
glass
in
her
hand
and
sat
on
the
bed
What
's
the
matter
darling
Do
you
feel
rocky
She
kissed
me
coolly
on
the
forehead
Oh
Brett
I
love
you
so
much
Darling
she
said
Then
Do
you
want
me
to
send
him
away
No
He
's
nice
I
'll
send
him
away
No
do
n't
Yes
I
'll
send
him
away
You
ca
n't
just
like
that
Ca
n't
I
though
You
stay
here
He
's
mad
about
me
I
tell
you
She
was
gone
out
of
the
room
I
lay
face
down
on
the
bed
I
was
having
a
bad
time
I
heard
them
talking
but
I
did
not
listen
Brett
came
in
and
sat
on
the
bed
Poor
old
darling
She
stroked
my
head
What
did
you
say
to
him
I
was
lying
with
my
face
away
from
her
I
did
not
want
to
see
her
Sent
him
for
champagne
He
loves
to
go
for
champagne
Then
later
Do
you
feel
better
darling
Is
the
head
any
better
It
's
better
Lie
quiet
He
's
gone
to
the
other
side
of
town
Could
n't
we
live
together
Brett
Could
n't
we
just
live
together
I
do
n't
think
so
I
'd
just
tromper
you
with
everybody
You
could
n't
stand
it
I
stand
it
now
That
would
be
different
It
's
my
fault
Jake
It
's
the
way
I
'm
made
Could
n't
we
go
off
in
the
country
for
a
while
It
would
n't
be
any
good
I
'll
go
if
you
like
But
I
could
n't
live
quietly
in
the
country
Not
with
my
own
true
love
I
know
Is
n't
it
rotten
There
is
n't
any
use
my
telling
you
I
love
you
You
know
I
love
you
Let
's
not
talk
Talking
's
all
bilge
I
'm
going
away
from
you
and
then
Michael
's
coming
back
Why
are
you
going
away
Better
for
you
Better
for
me
When
are
you
going
Soon
as
I
can
Where
San
Sebastian
Ca
n't
we
go
together
No
That
would
be
a
hell
of
an
idea
after
we
'd
just
talked
it
out
We
never
agreed
Oh
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
Do
n't
be
obstinate
darling
Oh
sure
I
said
I
know
you
're
right
I
'm
just
low
and
when
I
'm
low
I
talk
like
a
fool
I
sat
up
leaned
over
found
my
shoes
beside
the
bed
and
put
them
on
I
stood
up
Do
n't
look
like
that
darling
How
do
you
want
me
to
look
Oh
do
n't
be
a
fool
I
'm
going
away
to-morrow
To-morrow
Yes
Did
n't
I
say
so
I
am
Let
's
have
a
drink
then
The
count
will
be
back
Yes
He
should
be
back
You
know
he
's
extraordinary
about
buying
champagne
It
means
any
amount
to
him
We
went
into
the
dining-room
I
took
up
the
brandy
bottle
and
poured
Brett
a
