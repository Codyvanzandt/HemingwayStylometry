It
had
cleared
and
there
were
no
clouds
on
the
mountains
Outside
under
the
window
were
some
carts
and
an
old
diligence
the
wood
of
the
roof
cracked
and
split
by
the
weather
It
must
have
been
left
from
the
days
before
the
motor-buses
A
goat
hopped
up
on
one
of
the
carts
and
then
to
the
roof
of
the
diligence
He
jerked
his
head
at
the
other
goats
below
and
when
I
waved
at
him
he
bounded
down
Bill
was
still
sleeping
so
I
dressed
put
on
my
shoes
outside
in
the
hall
and
went
down-stairs
No
one
was
stirring
down-stairs
so
I
unbolted
the
door
and
went
out
It
was
cool
outside
in
the
early
morning
and
the
sun
had
not
yet
dried
the
dew
that
had
come
when
the
wind
died
down
I
hunted
around
in
the
shed
behind
the
inn
and
found
a
sort
of
mattock
and
went
down
toward
the
stream
to
try
and
dig
some
worms
for
bait
The
stream
was
clear
and
shallow
but
it
did
not
look
trouty
On
the
grassy
bank
where
it
was
damp
I
drove
the
mattock
into
the
earth
and
loosened
a
chunk
of
sod
There
were
worms
underneath
They
slid
out
of
sight
as
I
lifted
the
sod
and
I
dug
carefully
and
got
a
good
many
Digging
at
the
edge
of
the
damp
ground
I
filled
two
empty
tobacco-tins
with
worms
and
sifted
dirt
onto
them
The
goats
watched
me
dig
When
I
went
back
into
the
inn
the
woman
was
down
in
the
kitchen
and
I
asked
her
to
get
coffee
for
us
and
that
we
wanted
a
lunch
Bill
was
awake
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
I
saw
you
out
of
the
window
he
said
Did
n't
want
to
interrupt
you
What
were
you
doing
Burying
your
money
You
lazy
bum
Been
working
for
the
common
good
Splendid
I
want
you
to
do
that
every
morning
Come
on
I
said
Get
up
What
Get
up
I
never
get
up
He
climbed
into
bed
and
pulled
the
sheet
up
to
his
chin
Try
and
argue
me
into
getting
up
I
went
on
looking
for
the
tackle
and
putting
it
all
together
in
the
tackle-bag
Are
n't
you
interested
Bill
asked
I
'm
going
down
and
eat
Eat
Why
did
n't
you
say
eat
I
thought
you
just
wanted
me
to
get
up
for
fun
Eat
Fine
Now
you
're
reasonable
You
go
out
and
dig
some
more
worms
and
I
'll
be
right
down
Oh
go
to
hell
Work
for
the
good
of
all
Bill
stepped
into
his
underclothes
Show
irony
and
pity
I
started
out
of
the
room
with
the
tackle-bag
the
nets
and
the
rod-case
Hey
come
back
I
put
my
head
in
the
door
Are
n't
you
going
to
show
a
little
irony
and
pity
I
thumbed
my
nose
That
's
not
irony
As
I
went
down-stairs
I
heard
Bill
singing
Irony
and
Pity
When
you
're
feeling
Oh
Give
them
Irony
and
Give
them
Pity
Oh
give
them
Irony
When
they
're
feeling
Just
a
little
irony
Just
a
little
pity
He
kept
on
singing
until
he
came
down-stairs
The
tune
was
The
Bells
are
Ringing
for
Me
and
my
Gal
I
was
reading
a
week-old
Spanish
paper
What
's
all
this
irony
and
pity
What
Do
n't
you
know
about
Irony
and
Pity
No
Who
got
it
up
Everybody
They
're
mad
about
it
in
New
York
It
's
just
like
the
Fratellinis
used
to
be
The
girl
came
in
with
the
coffee
and
buttered
toast
Or
rather
it
was
bread
toasted
and
buttered
Ask
her
if
she
's
got
any
jam
Bill
said
Be
ironical
with
her
Have
you
got
any
jam
That
's
not
ironical
I
wish
I
could
talk
Spanish
The
coffee
was
good
and
we
drank
it
out
of
big
bowls
The
girl
brought
in
a
glass
dish
of
raspberry
jam
Thank
you
Hey
that
's
not
the
way
Bill
said
Say
something
ironical
Make
some
crack
about
Primo
de
Rivera
I
could
ask
her
what
kind
of
a
jam
they
think
they
've
gotten
into
in
the
Riff
Poor
said
Bill
Very
poor
You
ca
n't
do
it
That
's
all
You
do
n't
understand
irony
You
have
no
pity
Say
something
pitiful
Robert
Cohn
Not
so
bad
That
's
better
Now
why
is
Cohn
pitiful
Be
ironic
He
took
a
big
gulp
of
coffee
Aw
hell
I
said
It
's
too
early
in
the
morning
There
you
go
And
you
claim
you
want
to
be
a
writer
too
You
're
only
a
newspaper
man
An
expatriated
newspaper
man
You
ought
to
be
ironical
the
minute
you
get
out
of
bed
You
ought
to
wake
up
with
your
mouth
full
of
pity
Go
on
I
said
Who
did
you
get
this
stuff
from
Everybody
Do
n't
you
read
Do
n't
you
ever
see
anybody
You
know
what
you
are
You
're
an
expatriate
Why
do
n't
you
live
in
New
York
Then
you
'd
know
these
things
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
Come
over
here
and
tell
you
every
year
Take
some
more
coffee
I
said
Good
Coffee
is
good
for
you
It
's
the
caffeine
in
it
Caffeine
we
are
here
Caffeine
puts
a
man
on
her
horse
and
a
woman
in
his
grave
You
know
what
's
the
trouble
with
you
You
're
an
expatriate
One
of
the
worst
type
Have
n't
you
heard
that
Nobody
that
ever
left
their
own
country
ever
wrote
anything
worth
printing
Not
even
in
the
newspapers
He
drank
the
coffee
You
're
an
expatriate
You
've
lost
touch
with
the
soil
You
get
precious
Fake
European
standards
have
ruined
you
You
drink
yourself
to
death
You
become
obsessed
by
sex
You
spend
all
your
time
talking
not
working
You
are
an
expatriate
see
You
hang
around
caf√©s
It
sounds
like
a
swell
life
I
said
When
do
I
work
You
do
n't
work
One
group
claims
women
support
you
Another
group
claims
you
're
impotent
No
I
said
I
just
had
an
accident
Never
mention
that
Bill
said
That
's
the
sort
of
thing
that
ca
n't
be
spoken
of
That
's
what
you
ought
to
work
up
into
a
mystery
Like
Henry
's
bicycle
He
had
been
going
splendidly
but
he
stopped
I
was
afraid
he
thought
he
had
hurt
me
with
that
crack
about
being
impotent
I
wanted
to
start
him
again
It
was
n't
a
bicycle
I
said
He
was
riding
horseback
I
heard
it
was
a
tricycle
Well
I
said
A
plane
is
sort
of
like
a
tricycle
The
joystick
works
the
same
way
But
you
do
n't
pedal
it
No
I
said
I
guess
you
do
n't
pedal
it
Let
's
lay
off
that
Bill
said
All
right
I
was
just
standing
up
for
the
tricycle
I
think
he
's
a
good
writer
too
Bill
said
And
you
're
a
hell
of
a
good
guy
Anybody
ever
tell
you
you
were
a
good
guy
I
'm
not
a
good
guy
Listen
You
're
a
hell
of
a
good
guy
and
I
'm
fonder
of
you
than
anybody
on
earth
I
could
n't
tell
you
that
in
New
York
It
'd
mean
I
was
a
faggot
That
was
what
the
Civil
War
was
about
Abraham
Lincoln
was
a
faggot
He
was
in
love
with
General
Grant
So
was
Jefferson
Davis
Lincoln
just
freed
the
slaves
on
a
bet
The
Dred
Scott
case
was
framed
by
the
Anti-Saloon
League
Sex
explains
it
all
The
Colonel
's
Lady
and
Judy
O'Grady
are
Lesbians
under
their
skin
He
stopped
Want
to
hear
some
more
Shoot
I
said
I
do
n't
know
any
more
Tell
you
some
more
at
lunch
Old
Bill
I
said
You
bum
We
packed
the
lunch
and
two
bottles
of
wine
in
the
rucksack
and
Bill
put
it
on
I
carried
the
rod-case
and
the
landing-nets
slung
over
my
back
We
started
up
the
road
and
then
went
across
a
meadow
and
found
a
path
that
crossed
the
fields
and
went
toward
the
woods
on
the
slope
of
the
first
hill
We
walked
across
the
fields
on
the
sandy
path
The
fields
were
rolling
and
grassy
and
the
grass
was
short
from
the
sheep
grazing
The
cattle
were
up
in
the
hills
We
heard
their
bells
in
the
woods
The
path
crossed
a
stream
on
a
foot-log
The
log
was
surfaced
off
and
there
was
a
sapling
bent
across
for
a
rail
In
the
flat
pool
beside
the
stream
tadpoles
spotted
the
sand
We
went
up
a
steep
bank
and
across
the
rolling
fields
Looking
back
we
saw
Burguete
white
houses
and
red
roofs
and
the
white
road
with
a
truck
going
along
it
and
the
dust
rising
Beyond
the
fields
we
crossed
another
faster-flowing
stream
A
sandy
road
led
down
to
the
ford
and
beyond
into
the
woods
The
path
crossed
the
stream
on
another
foot-log
below
the
ford
and
joined
the
road
and
we
went
into
the
woods
It
was
a
beech
wood
and
the
trees
were
very
old
Their
roots
bulked
above
the
ground
and
the
branches
were
twisted
We
walked
on
the
road
between
the
thick
trunks
of
the
old
beeches
and
the
sunlight
came
through
the
leaves
in
light
patches
on
the
grass
The
trees
were
big
and
the
foliage
was
thick
but
it
was
not
gloomy
There
was
no
undergrowth
only
the
smooth
grass
very
green
and
fresh
and
the
big
gray
trees
well
spaced
as
though
it
were
a
park
This
is
country
Bill
said
The
road
went
up
a
hill
and
we
got
into
thick
woods
and
the
road
kept
on
climbing
Sometimes
it
dipped
down
but
rose
again
steeply
All
the
time
we
heard
the
cattle
in
the
woods
Finally
the
road
came
out
on
the
top
of
the
hills
We
were
on
the
top
of
the
height
of
land
that
was
the
highest
part
of
the
range
of
wooded
hills
we
had
seen
from
Burguete
There
were
wild
strawberries
growing
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
ridge
in
a
little
clearing
in
the
trees
Ahead
the
road
came
out
of
the
forest
and
went
along
the
shoulder
of
the
ridge
of
hills
The
hills
ahead
were
not
wooded
and
there
were
great
fields
of
yellow
gorse
Way
off
we
saw
the
steep
bluffs
dark
with
trees
and
jutting
with
gray
stone
that
marked
the
course
of
the
Irati
River
We
have
to
follow
this
road
along
the
ridge
cross
these
hills
go
through
the
woods
on
the
far
hills
and
come
down
to
the
Irati
valley
I
pointed
out
to
Bill
That
's
a
hell
of
a
hike
It
's
too
far
to
go
and
fish
and
come
back
the
same
day
comfortably
Comfortably
That
's
a
nice
word
We
'll
have
to
go
like
hell
to
get
there
and
back
and
have
any
fishing
at
all
It
was
a
long
walk
and
the
country
was
very
fine
but
we
were
tired
when
we
came
down
the
steep
road
that
led
out
of
the
wooded
hills
into
the
valley
of
the
Rio
de
la
Fabrica
The
road
came
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
woods
into
the
hot
sun
Ahead
was
a
river-valley
Beyond
the
river
was
a
steep
hill
There
was
a
field
of
buckwheat
on
the
hill
We
saw
a
white
house
under
some
trees
on
the
hillside
It
was
very
hot
and
we
stopped
under
some
trees
beside
a
dam
that
crossed
the
river
Bill
put
the
pack
against
one
of
the
trees
and
we
jointed
up
the
rods
put
on
the
reels
tied
on
leaders
and
got
ready
to
fish
You
're
sure
this
thing
has
trout
in
it
Bill
asked
It
's
full
of
them
I
'm
going
to
fish
a
fly
You
got
any
McGintys
There
's
some
in
there
You
going
to
fish
bait
Yeah
I
'm
going
to
fish
the
dam
here
Well
I
'll
take
the
fly-book
then
He
tied
on
a
fly
Where
'd
I
better
go
Up
or
down
Down
is
the
best
They
're
plenty
up
above
too
Bill
went
down
the
bank
Take
a
worm
can
No
I
do
n't
want
one
If
they
wo
n't
take
a
fly
I
'll
just
flick
it
around
Bill
was
down
below
watching
the
stream
Say
he
called
up
against
the
noise
of
the
dam
How
about
putting
the
wine
in
that
spring
up
the
road
All
right
I
shouted
Bill
waved
his
hand
and
started
down
the
stream
I
found
the
two
wine-bottles
in
the
pack
and
carried
them
up
the
road
to
where
the
water
of
a
spring
flowed
out
of
an
iron
pipe
There
was
a
board
over
the
spring
and
I
lifted
it
and
knocking
the
corks
firmly
into
the
bottles
lowered
them
down
into
the
water
It
was
so
cold
my
hand
and
wrist
felt
numbed
I
put
back
the
slab
of
wood
and
hoped
nobody
would
find
the
wine
I
got
my
rod
that
was
leaning
against
the
tree
took
the
bait-can
and
landing-net
and
walked
out
onto
the
dam
It
was
built
to
provide
a
head
of
water
for
driving
logs
The
gate
was
up
and
I
sat
on
one
of
the
squared
timbers
and
watched
the
smooth
apron
of
water
before
the
river
tumbled
into
the
falls
In
the
white
water
at
the
foot
of
the
dam
it
was
deep
As
I
baited
up
a
trout
shot
up
out
of
the
white
water
into
the
falls
and
was
carried
down
Before
I
could
finish
baiting
another
trout
jumped
at
the
falls
making
the
same
lovely
arc
and
disappearing
into
the
water
that
was
thundering
down
I
put
on
a
good-sized
sinker
and
dropped
into
the
white
water
close
to
the
edge
of
the
timbers
of
the
dam
I
did
not
feel
the
first
trout
strike
When
I
started
to
pull
up
I
felt
that
I
had
one
and
brought
him
fighting
and
bending
the
rod
almost
double
out
of
the
boiling
water
at
the
foot
of
the
falls
and
swung
him
up
and
onto
the
dam
He
was
a
good
trout
and
I
banged
his
head
against
the
timber
so
that
he
quivered
out
straight
and
then
slipped
him
into
my
bag
While
I
had
him
on
several
trout
had
jumped
at
the
falls
As
soon
as
I
baited
up
and
dropped
in
again
I
hooked
another
and
brought
him
in
the
same
way
In
a
little
while
I
had
six
They
were
all
about
the
same
size
I
laid
them
out
side
by
side
all
their
heads
pointing
the
same
way
and
looked
at
them
They
were
beautifully
colored
and
firm
and
hard
from
the
cold
water
It
was
a
hot
day
so
I
slit
them
all
and
shucked
out
the
insides
gills
and
all
and
tossed
them
over
across
the
river
I
took
the
trout
ashore
washed
them
in
the
cold
smoothly
heavy
water
above
the
dam
and
then
picked
some
ferns
and
packed
them
all
in
the
bag
three
trout
on
a
layer
of
ferns
then
another
layer
of
fems
then
three
more
trout
and
then
covered
them
with
ferns
They
looked
nice
in
the
ferns
and
now
the
bag
was
bulky
and
I
put
it
in
the
shade
of
the
tree
It
was
very
hot
on
the
dam
so
I
put
my
worm-can
in
the
shade
with
the
bag
and
got
a
book
out
of
the
pack
and
settled
down
under
the
tree
to
read
until
Bill
should
come
up
for
lunch
It
was
a
little
past
noon
and
there
was
not
much
shade
but
I
sat
against
the
trunk
of
two
of
the
trees
that
grew
together
and
read
The
book
was
something
by
A
E
W
Mason
and
I
was
reading
a
wonderful
story
about
a
man
who
had
been
frozen
in
the
Alps
and
then
fallen
into
a
glacier
and
disappeared
and
his
bride
was
going
to
wait
twenty-four
years
exactly
for
his
body
to
come
out
on
the
moraine
while
her
true
love
waited
too
and
they
were
still
waiting
when
Bill
came
up
Get
any
he
asked
He
had
his
rod
and
his
bag
and
his
net
all
in
one
hand
and
he
was
sweating
I
had
n't
heard
him
come
up
because
of
the
noise
from
the
dam
Six
What
did
you
get
Bill
sat
down
opened
up
his
bag
laid
a
big
trout
on
the
grass
He
took
out
three
more
each
one
a
little
bigger
than
the
last
and
laid
them
side
by
side
in
the
shade
from
the
tree
His
face
was
sweaty
and
happy
How
are
yours
Smaller
Let
's
see
them
They
're
packed
How
big
are
they
really
They
're
all
about
the
size
of
your
smallest
You
're
not
holding
out
on
me
I
wish
I
were
Get
them
all
on
worms
Yes
You
lazy
bum
Bill
put
the
trout
in
the
bag
and
started
for
the
river
swinging
the
open
bag
He
was
wet
from
the
waist
down
and
I
knew
he
must
have
been
wading
the
stream
I
walked
up
the
road
and
got
out
the
two
bottles
of
wine
They
were
cold
Moisture
beaded
on
the
bottles
as
I
walked
back
to
the
trees
I
spread
the
lunch
on
a
newspaper
and
uncorked
one
of
the
bottles
and
leaned
the
other
against
a
tree
Bill
came
up
drying
his
hands
his
bag
plump
with
ferns
Let
's
see
that
bottle
he
said
He
pulled
the
cork
and
tipped
up
the
bottle
and
drank
Whew
That
makes
my
eyes
ache
Let
's
try
it
The
wine
was
icy
cold
and
tasted
faintly
rusty
That
's
not
such
filthy
wine
Bill
said
The
cold
helps
it
I
said
We
unwrapped
the
little
parcels
of
lunch
Chicken
There
's
hard-boiled
eggs
Find
any
salt
First
the
egg
said
Bill
Then
the
chicken
Even
Bryan
could
see
that
He
's
dead
I
read
it
in
the
paper
yesterday
No
Not
really
Yes
Bryan
's
dead
Bill
laid
down
the
egg
he
was
peeling
Gentlemen
he
said
and
unwrapped
a
drumstick
from
a
piece
of
newspaper
I
reverse
the
order
For
Bryan
's
sake
As
a
tribute
to
the
Great
Commoner
First
the
chicken
then
the
egg
Wonder
what
day
God
created
the
chicken
Oh
said
Bill
sucking
the
drumstick
how
should
we
know
We
should
not
question
Our
stay
on
earth
is
not
for
long
Let
us
rejoice
and
believe
and
give
thanks
Eat
an
egg
Bill
gestured
with
the
drumstick
in
one
hand
and
the
bottle
of
wine
in
the
other
Let
us
rejoice
in
our
blessings
Let
us
utilize
the
fowls
of
the
air
Let
us
utilize
the
product
of
the
vine
Will
you
utilize
a
little
brother
After
you
brother
Bill
took
a
long
drink
Utilize
a
little
brother
he
handed
me
the
bottle
Let
us
not
doubt
brother
Let
us
not
pry
into
the
holy
mysteries
of
the
hen-coop
with
simian
fingers
Let
us
accept
on
faith
and
simply
say
I
want
you
to
join
with
me
in
saying
What
shall
we
say
brother
He
pointed
the
drumstick
at
me
and
went
on
Let
me
tell
you
We
will
say
and
I
for
one
am
proud
to
say
and
I
want
you
to
say
with
me
on
your
knees
brother
Let
no
man
be
ashamed
to
kneel
here
in
the
great
out-of-doors
Remember
the
woods
were
God
's
first
temples
Let
us
kneel
and
say
'Do
n't
eat
that
Lady
that
's
Mencken
Here
I
said
Utilize
a
little
of
this
We
uncorked
the
other
bottle
What
's
the
matter
I
said
Did
n't
you
like
Bryan
I
loved
Bryan
said
Bill
We
were
like
brothers
Where
did
you
know
him
He
and
Mencken
and
I
all
went
to
Holy
Cross
together
And
Frankie
Fritsch
It
's
a
lie
Frankie
Fritsch
went
to
Fordham
Well
I
said
I
went
to
Loyola
with
Bishop
Manning
It
's
a
lie
Bill
said
I
went
to
Loyola
with
Bishop
Manning
myself
You
're
cock-eyed
I
said
On
wine
Why
not
It
's
the
humidity
Bill
said
They
ought
to
take
this
damn
humidity
away
Have
another
shot
Is
this
all
we
've
got
Only
the
two
bottles
Do
you
know
what
you
are
Bill
looked
at
the
bottle
affectionately
No
I
said
You
're
in
the
pay
of
the
Anti-Saloon
League
I
went
to
Notre
Dame
with
Wayne
B
Wheeler
It
's
a
lie
said
Bill
I
went
to
Austin
Business
College
with
Wayne
B
Wheeler
He
was
class
president
Well
I
said
the
saloon
must
go
You
're
right
there
old
classmate
Bill
said
The
saloon
must
go
and
I
will
take
it
with
me
You
're
cock-eyed
On
wine
On
wine
Well
maybe
I
am
Want
to
take
a
nap
All
right
We
lay
with
our
heads
in
the
shade
and
looked
up
into
the
trees
You
asleep
No
Bill
said
I
was
thinking
I
shut
my
eyes
It
felt
good
lying
on
the
ground
Say
Bill
said
what
about
this
Brett
business
What
about
it
Were
you
ever
in
love
with
her
Sure
For
how
long
Off
and
on
for
a
hell
of
a
long
time
Oh
hell
Bill
said
I
'm
sorry
fella
It
's
all
right
I
said
I
do
n't
give
a
damn
any
more
Really
Really
Only
I
'd
a
hell
of
a
lot
rather
not
talk
about
it
You
are
n't
sore
I
asked
you
Why
the
hell
should
I
be
I
'm
going
to
sleep
Bill
said
He
put
a
newspaper
over
his
face
Listen
Jake
he
said
are
you
really
a
Catholic
Technically
What
does
that
mean
I
do
n't
know
All
right
I
'll
go
to
sleep
now
he
said
Do
n't
keep
me
awake
by
talking
so
much
I
went
to
sleep
too
When
I
woke
up
Bill
was
packing
the
rucksack
It
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
the
shadow
from
the
trees
was
long
and
went
out
over
the
dam
I
was
stiff
from
sleeping
on
the
ground
What
did
you
do
Wake
up
Bill
asked
Why
did
n't
you
spend
the
night
I
stretched
and
rubbed
my
eyes
I
had
a
lovely
dream
Bill
said
I
do
n't
remember
what
it
was
about
but
it
was
a
lovely
dream
I
do
n't
think
I
dreamt
You
ought
to
dream
Bill
said
All
our
biggest
business
men
have
been
dreamers
Look
at
Ford
Look
at
President
Coolidge
Look
at
Rockefeller
Look
at
Jo
Davidson
I
disjointed
my
rod
and
Bill
's
and
packed
them
in
the
rod-case
I
put
the
reels
in
the
tackle-bag
Bill
had
packed
the
rucksack
and
we
put
one
of
the
trout-bags
in
I
carried
the
other
Well
said
Bill
have
we
got
everything
The
worms
Your
worms
Put
them
in
there
He
had
the
pack
on
his
back
and
I
put
the
worm-cans
in
one
of
the
outside
flap
pockets
You
got
everything
now
I
looked
around
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
elm-trees
Yes
We
started
up
the
road
into
the
woods
It
was
a
long
walk
home
to
Burguete
and
it
was
dark
when
we
came
down
across
the
fields
to
the
road
and
along
the
road
between
the
houses
of
the
town
their
windows
lighted
to
the
inn
We
stayed
five
days
at
Burguete
and
had
good
fishing
The
nights
were
cold
and
the
days
were
hot
and
there
was
always
a
breeze
even
in
the
heat
of
the
day
It
was
hot
enough
so
that
it
felt
good
to
wade
in
a
cold
stream
and
the
sun
dried
you
when
you
came
out
and
sat
on
the
bank
We
found
a
stream
with
a
pool
deep
enough
to
swim
in
In
the
evenings
we
played
three-handed
bridge
with
an
Englishman
named
Harris
who
had
walked
over
from
Saint
Jean
Pied
de
Port
and
was
stopping
at
the
inn
for
the
fishing
He
was
very
pleasant
and
went
with
us
twice
to
the
Irati
River
There
was
no
word
from
Robert
Cohn
nor
from
Brett
and
Mike
One
morning
I
went
down
to
breakfast
and
the
Englishman
Harris
was
already
at
the
table
He
was
reading
the
paper
through
spectacles
He
looked
up
and
smiled
Good
morning
he
said
Letter
for
you
I
stopped
at
the
post
and
they
gave
it
me
with
mine
The
letter
was
at
my
place
at
the
table
leaning
against
a
coffee-cup
Harris
was
reading
the
paper
again
I
opened
the
letter
It
had
been
forwarded
from
Pamplona
It
was
dated
San
Sebastian
Sunday
DEAR
JAKE
We
got
here
Friday
Brett
passed
out
on
the
train
so
brought
her
here
for
3
days
rest
with
old
friends
of
ours
We
go
to
Montoya
Hotel
Pamplona
Tuesday
arriving
at
I
do
n't
know
what
hour
Will
you
send
a
note
by
the
bus
to
tell
us
what
to
do
to
rejoin
you
all
on
Wednesday
All
our
love
and
sorry
to
be
late
but
Brett
was
really
done
in
and
will
be
quite
all
right
by
Tues
and
is
practically
so
now
I
know
her
so
well
and
try
to
look
after
her
but
it
's
not
so
easy
Love
to
all
the
chaps
MICHAEL
What
day
of
the
week
is
it
I
asked
Harris
Wednesday
I
think
Yes
quite
Wednesday
Wonderful
how
one
loses
track
of
the
days
up
here
in
the
mountains
Yes
We
've
been
here
nearly
a
week
I
hope
you
're
not
thinking
of
leaving
Yes
We
'll
go
in
on
the
afternoon
bus
I
'm
afraid
What
a
rotten
business
I
had
hoped
we
'd
all
have
another
go
at
the
Irati
together
We
have
to
go
into
Pamplona
We
're
meeting
people
there
What
rotten
luck
for
me
We
've
had
a
jolly
time
here
at
Burguete
Come
on
in
to
Pamplona
We
can
play
some
bridge
there
and
there
's
going
to
be
a
damned
fine
fiesta
I
'd
like
to
Awfully
nice
of
you
to
ask
me
I
'd
best
stop
on
here
though
I
've
not
much
more
time
to
fish
You
want
those
big
ones
in
the
Irati
I
say
I
do
you
know
They
're
enormous
trout
there
I
'd
like
to
try
them
once
more
Do
Stop
over
another
day
Be
a
good
chap
We
really
have
to
get
into
town
I
said
What
a
pity
After
breakfast
Bill
and
I
were
sitting
warming
in
the
sun
on
a
bench
out
in
front
of
the
inn
and
talking
it
over
I
saw
a
girl
coming
up
the
road
from
the
centre
of
the
town
She
stopped
in
front
of
us
and
took
a
telegram
out
of
the
leather
wallet
that
hung
against
her
skirt
Por
ustedes
I
looked
at
it
The
address
was
Barnes
Burguete
Yes
It
's
for
us
She
brought
out
a
book
for
me
to
sign
and
I
gave
her
a
couple
of
coppers
The
telegram
was
in
Spanish
Vengo
Jueves
Cohn
I
handed
it
to
Bill
What
does
the
word
Cohn
mean
he
asked
What
a
lousy
telegram
I
said
He
could
send
ten
words
for
the
same
price
'I
come
Thursday
That
gives
you
a
lot
of
dope
does
n't
it
It
gives
you
all
the
dope
that
's
of
interest
to
Cohn
We
're
going
in
anyway
I
said
There
's
no
use
trying
to
move
Brett
and
Mike
out
here
and
back
before
the
fiesta
Should
we
answer
it
We
might
as
well
said
Bill
There
's
no
need
for
us
to
be
snooty
We
walked
up
to
the
post-office
and
asked
for
a
telegraph
blank
What
will
we
say
Bill
asked
'Arriving
to-night
That
's
enough
We
paid
for
the
message
and
walked
back
to
the
inn
Harris
was
there
and
the
three
of
us
walked
up
to
Roncesvalles
We
went
through
the
monastery
It
's
a
remarkable
place
Harris
said
when
we
came
out
But
you
know
I
'm
not
much
on
those
sort
of
places
Me
either
Bill
said
It
's
a
remarkable
place
though
Harris
said
I
would
n't
not
have
seen
it
I
'd
been
intending
coming
up
each
day
It
is
n't
the
same
as
fishing
though
is
it
Bill
asked
He
liked
Harris
I
say
not
We
were
standing
in
front
of
the
old
chapel
of
the
monastery
Is
n't
that
a
pub
across
the
way
Harris
asked
Or
do
my
eyes
deceive
me
It
has
the
look
of
a
pub
Bill
said
It
looks
to
me
like
a
pub
I
said
I
say
said
Harris
let
's
utilize
it
He
had
taken
up
utilizing
from
Bill
We
had
a
bottle
of
wine
apiece
Harris
would
not
let
us
pay
He
talked
Spanish
quite
well
and
the
innkeeper
would
not
take
our
money
I
say
You
do
n't
know
what
it
's
meant
to
me
to
have
you
chaps
up
here
We
've
had
a
grand
time
Harris
Harris
was
a
little
tight
I
say
Really
you
do
n't
know
how
much
it
means
I
've
not
had
much
fun
since
the
war
We
'll
fish
together
again
some
time
Do
n't
you
forget
it
Harris
We
must
We
have
had
such
a
jolly
good
time
How
about
another
bottle
around
Jolly
good
idea
said
Harris
This
is
mine
said
Bill
Or
we
do
n't
drink
it
I
wish
you
'd
let
me
pay
for
it
It
does
give
me
pleasure
you
know
This
is
going
to
give
me
pleasure
Bill
said
The
innkeeper
brought
in
the
fourth
bottle
We
had
kept
the
same
glasses
Harris
lifted
his
glass
I
say
You
know
this
does
utilize
well
Bill
slapped
him
on
the
back
Good
old
Harris
I
say
You
know
my
name
is
n't
really
Harris
It
's
Wilson-Harris
All
one
name
With
a
hyphen
you
know
Good
