floor
where
Georgette
was
dancing
in
the
arms
of
the
tall
dark
one
called
Lett
Is
n't
she
I
said
Rather
said
Mrs
Braddocks
Cohn
came
up
Come
on
Jake
he
said
have
a
drink
We
walked
over
to
the
bar
What
's
the
matter
with
you
You
seem
all
worked
up
over
something
Nothing
This
whole
show
makes
me
sick
is
all
Brett
came
up
to
the
bar
Hello
you
chaps
Hello
Brett
I
said
Why
are
n't
you
tight
Never
going
to
get
tight
any
more
I
say
give
a
chap
a
brandy
and
soda
She
stood
holding
the
glass
and
I
saw
Robert
Cohn
looking
at
her
He
looked
a
great
deal
as
his
compatriot
must
have
looked
when
he
saw
the
promised
land
Cohn
of
course
was
much
younger
But
he
had
that
look
of
eager
deserving
expectation
Brett
was
damned
good-looking
She
wore
a
slipover
jersey
sweater
and
a
tweed
skirt
and
her
hair
was
brushed
back
like
a
boy
's
She
started
all
that
She
was
built
with
curves
like
the
hull
of
a
racing
yacht
and
you
missed
none
of
it
with
that
wool
jersey
It
's
a
fine
crowd
you
're
with
Brett
I
said
Are
n't
they
lovely
And
you
my
dear
Where
did
you
get
it
At
the
Napolitain
And
have
you
had
a
lovely
evening
Oh
priceless
I
said
Brett
laughed
It
's
wrong
of
you
Jake
It
's
an
insult
to
all
of
us
Look
at
Frances
there
and
Jo
This
for
Cohn
's
benefit
It
's
in
restraint
of
trade
Brett
said
She
laughed
again
You
're
wonderfully
sober
I
said
Yes
Are
n't
I
And
when
one
's
with
the
crowd
I
'm
with
one
can
drink
in
such
safety
too
The
music
started
and
Robert
Cohn
said
Will
you
dance
this
with
me
Lady
Brett
Brett
smiled
at
him
I
've
promised
to
dance
this
with
Jacob
she
laughed
You
've
a
hell
of
a
biblical
name
Jake
How
about
the
next
asked
Cohn
We
're
going
Brett
said
We
've
a
date
up
at
Montmartre
Dancing
I
looked
over
Brett
's
shoulder
and
saw
Cohn
standing
at
the
bar
still
watching
her
You
've
made
a
new
one
there
I
said
to
her
Do
n't
talk
about
it
Poor
chap
I
never
knew
it
till
just
now
Oh
well
I
said
I
suppose
you
like
to
add
them
up
Do
n't
talk
like
a
fool
You
do
Oh
well
What
if
I
do
Nothing
I
said
We
were
dancing
to
the
accordion
and
some
one
was
playing
the
banjo
It
was
hot
and
I
felt
happy
We
passed
close
to
Georgette
dancing
with
another
one
of
them
What
possessed
you
to
bring
her
I
do
n't
know
I
just
brought
her
You
're
getting
damned
romantic
No
bored
Now
No
not
now
Let
's
get
out
of
here
She
's
well
taken
care
of
Do
you
want
to
Would
I
ask
you
if
I
did
n't
want
to
We
left
the
floor
and
I
took
my
coat
off
a
hanger
on
the
wall
and
put
it
on
Brett
stood
by
the
bar
Cohn
was
talking
to
her
I
stopped
at
the
bar
and
asked
them
for
an
envelope
The
patronne
found
one
I
took
a
fifty-franc
note
from
my
pocket
put
it
in
the
envelope
sealed
it
and
handed
it
to
the
patronne
If
the
girl
I
came
with
asks
for
me
will
you
give
her
this
I
said
If
she
goes
out
with
one
of
those
gentlemen
will
you
save
this
for
me
C'est
entendu
Monsieur
the
patronne
said
You
go
now
So
early
Yes
I
said
We
started
out
the
door
Cohn
was
still
talking
to
Brett
She
said
good
night
and
took
my
arm
Good
night
Cohn
I
said
Outside
in
the
street
we
looked
for
a
taxi
You
're
going
to
lose
your
fifty
francs
Brett
said
Oh
yes
No
taxis
We
could
walk
up
to
the
Pantheon
and
get
one
Come
on
and
we
'll
get
a
drink
in
the
pub
next
door
and
send
for
one
You
would
n't
walk
across
the
street
Not
if
I
could
help
it
We
went
into
the
next
bar
and
I
sent
a
waiter
for
a
taxi
Well
I
said
we
're
out
away
from
them
We
stood
against
the
tall
zinc
bar
and
did
not
talk
and
looked
at
each
other
The
waiter
came
and
said
the
taxi
was
outside
Brett
pressed
my
hand
hard
I
gave
the
waiter
a
franc
and
we
went
out
Where
should
I
tell
him
I
asked
Oh
tell
him
to
drive
around
I
told
the
driver
to
go
to
the
Parc
Montsouris
and
got
in
and
slammed
the
door
Brett
was
leaning
back
in
the
corner
her
eyes
closed
I
got
in
and
sat
beside
her
The
cab
started
with
a
jerk
Oh
darling
I
've
been
so
miserable
Brett
said
The
taxi
went
up
the
hill
passed
the
lighted
square
then
on
into
the
dark
still
climbing
then
levelled
out
onto
a
dark
street
behind
St
Etienne
du
Mont
went
smoothly
down
the
asphalt
passed
the
trees
and
the
standing
bus
at
the
Place
de
la
Contrescarpe
then
turned
onto
the
cobbles
of
the
Rue
Mouffetard
There
were
lighted
bars
and
late
open
shops
on
each
side
of
the
street
We
were
sitting
apart
and
we
jolted
close
together
going
down
the
old
street
Brett
's
hat
was
off
Her
head
was
back
I
saw
her
face
in
the
lights
from
the
open
shops
then
it
was
dark
then
I
saw
her
face
clearly
as
we
came
out
on
the
Avenue
des
Gobelins
The
street
was
torn
up
and
men
were
working
on
the
car-tracks
by
the
light
of
acetylene
flares
Brett
's
face
was
white
and
the
long
line
of
her
neck
showed
in
the
bright
light
of
the
flares
The
street
was
dark
again
and
I
kissed
her
Our
lips
were
tight
together
and
then
she
turned
away
and
pressed
against
the
corner
of
the
seat
as
far
away
as
she
could
get
Her
head
was
down
Do
n't
touch
me
she
said
Please
do
n't
touch
me
What
's
the
matter
I
ca
n't
stand
it
Oh
Brett
You
must
n't
You
must
know
I
ca
n't
stand
it
that
's
all
Oh
darling
please
understand
Do
n't
you
love
me
Love
you
I
simply
turn
all
to
jelly
when
you
touch
me
Is
n't
there
anything
we
can
do
about
it
She
was
sitting
up
now
My
arm
was
around
her
and
she
was
leaning
back
against
me
and
we
were
quite
calm
She
was
looking
into
my
eyes
with
that
way
she
had
of
looking
that
made
you
wonder
whether
she
really
saw
out
of
her
own
eyes
They
would
look
on
and
on
after
every
one
else
's
eyes
in
the
world
would
have
stopped
looking
She
looked
as
though
there
were
nothing
on
earth
she
would
not
look
at
like
that
and
really
she
was
afraid
of
so
many
things
And
there
's
not
a
damn
thing
we
could
do
I
said
I
do
n't
know
she
said
I
do
n't
want
to
go
through
that
hell
again
We
'd
better
keep
away
from
each
other
But
darling
I
have
to
see
you
It
is
n't
all
that
you
know
No
but
it
always
gets
to
be
That
's
my
fault
Do
n't
we
pay
for
all
the
things
we
do
though
She
had
been
looking
into
my
eyes
all
the
time
Her
eyes
had
different
depths
sometimes
they
seemed
perfectly
flat
Now
you
could
see
all
the
way
into
them
When
I
think
of
the
hell
I
've
put
chaps
through
I
'm
paying
for
it
all
now
Do
n't
talk
like
a
fool
I
said
Besides
what
happened
to
me
is
supposed
to
be
funny
I
never
think
about
it
Oh
no
I
'll
lay
you
do
n't
Well
let
's
shut
up
about
it
I
laughed
about
it
too
myself
once
She
was
n't
looking
at
me
A
friend
of
my
brother
's
came
home
that
way
from
Mons
It
seemed
like
a
hell
of
a
joke
Chaps
never
know
anything
do
they
No
I
said
Nobody
ever
knows
anything
I
was
pretty
well
through
with
the
subject
At
one
time
or
another
I
had
probably
considered
it
from
most
of
its
various
angles
including
the
one
that
certain
injuries
or
imperfections
are
a
subject
of
merriment
while
remaining
quite
serious
for
the
person
possessing
them
It
's
funny
I
said
It
's
very
funny
And
it
's
a
lot
of
fun
too
to
be
in
love
Do
you
think
so
her
eyes
looked
flat
again
I
do
n't
mean
fun
that
way
In
a
way
it
's
an
enjoyable
feeling
No
she
said
I
think
it
's
hell
on
earth
It
's
good
to
see
each
other
No
I
do
n't
think
it
is
Do
n't
you
want
to
I
have
to
We
were
sitting
now
like
two
strangers
On
the
right
was
the
Parc
Montsouris
The
restaurant
where
they
have
the
pool
of
live
trout
and
where
you
can
sit
and
look
out
over
the
park
was
closed
and
dark
The
driver
leaned
his
head
around
Where
do
you
want
to
go
I
asked
Brett
turned
her
head
away
Oh
go
to
the
Select
Caf√©
Select
I
told
the
driver
Boulevard
Montparnasse
We
drove
straight
down
turning
around
the
Lion
de
Belfort
that
guards
the
passing
Montrouge
trams
Brett
looked
straight
ahead
On
the
Boulevard
Raspail
with
the
lights
of
Montparnasse
in
sight
Brett
said
Would
you
mind
very
much
if
I
asked
you
to
do
something
Do
n't
be
silly
Kiss
me
just
once
more
before
we
get
there
When
the
taxi
stopped
I
got
out
and
paid
Brett
came
out
putting
on
her
hat
She
gave
me
her
hand
as
she
stepped
down
Her
hand
was
shaky
I
say
do
I
look
too
much
of
a
mess
She
pulled
her
man
's
felt
hat
down
and
started
in
for
the
bar
Inside
against
the
bar
and
at
tables
were
most
of
the
crowd
who
a
been
at
the
dance
Hello
you
chaps
Brett
said
I
'm
going
to
have
a
drink
Oh
Brett
Brett
the
little
Greek
portrait-painter
who
called
himself
a
duke
and
whom
everybody
called
Zizi
pushed
up
to
her
I
got
something
fine
to
tell
you
Hello
Zizi
Brett
said
I
want
you
to
meet
a
friend
Zizi
said
A
fat
man
came
up
Count
Mippipopolous
meet
my
friend
Lady
Ashley
How
do
you
do
said
Brett
Well
does
your
Ladyship
have
a
good
time
here
in
Paris
asked
Count
Mippipopolous
who
wore
an
elk
's
tooth
on
his
watch-chain
Rather
said
Brett
Paris
is
a
fine
town
all
right
said
the
count
But
I
guess
you
have
pretty
big
doings
yourself
over
in
London
Oh
yes
said
Brett
Enormous
Braddocks
called
to
me
from
a
table
Barnes
he
said
have
a
drink
That
girl
of
yours
got
in
a
frightful
row
What
about
Something
the
patronne
's
daughter
said
A
corking
row
She
was
rather
splendid
you
know
Showed
her
yellow
card
and
demanded
the
patronne
's
daughter
's
too
I
say
it
was
a
row
What
finally
happened
Oh
some
one
took
her
home
Not
a
bad-looking
girl
Wonderful
command
of
the
idiom
Do
stay
and
have
a
drink
No
I
said
I
must
shove
off
Seen
Cohn
He
went
home
with
Frances
Mrs
Braddock
put
in
Poor
chap
he
looks
awfully
down
Braddocks
said
I
dare
say
he
is
said
Mrs
Braddocks
I
have
to
shove
off
I
said
Good
night
I
said
good
night
to
Brett
at
the
bar
The
count
was
buying
champagne
Will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
with
us
sir
he
asked
No
Thanks
awfully
I
have
to
go
Really
going
Brett
asked
Yes
I
said
I
've
got
a
rotten
headache
I
'll
see
you
to-morrow
Come
in
at
the
office
Hardly
Well
where
will
I
see
you
Anywhere
around
five
o'clock
Make
it
the
other
side
of
town
then
Good
I
'll
be
at
the
Crillon
at
five
Try
and
be
there
I
said
Do
n't
worry
Brett
said
I
've
never
let
you
down
have
I
Heard
from
Mike
Letter
to-day
Good
night
sir
said
the
count
I
went
out
onto
the
sidewalk
and
walked
down
toward
the
Boulevard
St
Michel
passed
the
tables
of
the
Rotonde
still
crowded
looked
across
the
street
at
the
Dome
its
tables
running
out
to
the
edge
of
the
pavement
Some
one
waved
at
me
from
a
table
I
did
not
see
who
it
was
and
went
on
I
wanted
to
get
home
The
Boulevard
Montparnasse
was
deserted
Lavigne
's
was
closed
tight
and
they
were
stacking
the
tables
outside
the
Closerie
des
Lilas
I
passed
Ney
's
statue
standing
among
the
new-leaved
chestnut-trees
in
the
arc-light
There
was
a
faded
purple
wreath
leaning
against
the
base
I
stopped
and
read
the
inscription
from
the
Bonapartist
Groups
some
date
I
forget
He
looked
very
fine
Marshal
Ney
in
his
top-boots
gesturing
with
his
sword
among
the
green
new
horse-chestnut
leaves
My
flat
was
just
across
the
street
a
little
way
down
the
Boulevard
St
Michel
There
was
a
light
in
the
concierge
's
room
and
I
knocked
on
the
door
and
she
gave
me
my
mail
I
wished
her
good
night
and
went
up-stairs
There
were
two
letters
and
some
papers
I
looked
at
them
under
the
gas-light
in
the
dining-room
The
letters
were
from
the
States
One
was
a
bank
statement
It
showed
a
balance
of
2432.60
I
got
out
my
check-book
and
deducted
four
checks
drawn
since
the
first
of
the
month
and
discovered
I
had
a
balance
of
1832.60
I
wrote
this
on
the
back
of
the
statement
The
other
letter
was
a
wedding
announcement
Mr
and
Mrs
Aloysius
Kirby
announce
the
marriage
of
their
daughter
Katherine
I
knew
neither
the
girl
nor
the
man
she
was
marrying
They
must
be
circularizing
the
town
It
was
a
funny
name
I
felt
sure
I
could
remember
anybody
with
a
name
like
Aloysius
It
was
a
good
Catholic
name
There
was
a
crest
on
the
announcement
Like
Zizi
the
Greek
duke
And
that
count
The
count
was
funny
Brett
had
a
title
too
Lady
Ashley
To
hell
with
Brett
To
hell
with
you
Lady
Ashley
I
lit
the
lamp
beside
the
bed
turned
off
the
gas
and
opened
the
wide
windows
The
bed
was
far
back
from
the
windows
and
I
sat
with
the
windows
open
and
undressed
by
the
bed
Outside
a
night
train
running
on
the
street-car
tracks
went
by
carrying
vegetables
to
the
markets
They
were
noisy
at
night
when
you
could
not
sleep
Undressing
I
looked
at
myself
in
the
mirror
of
the
big
armoire
beside
the
bed
That
was
a
typically
French
way
to
furnish
a
room
Practical
too
I
suppose
Of
all
the
ways
to
be
wounded
I
suppose
it
was
funny
I
put
on
my
pajamas
and
got
into
bed
I
had
the
two
bull-fight
papers
and
I
took
their
wrappers
off
One
was
orange
The
other
yellow
They
would
both
have
the
same
news
so
whichever
I
read
first
would
spoil
the
other
Le
Toril
was
the
better
paper
so
I
started
to
read
it
I
read
it
all
the
way
through
including
the
Petite
Correspondance
and
the
Cornigrams
I
blew
out
the
lamp
Perhaps
I
would
be
able
to
sleep
My
head
started
to
work
The
old
grievance
Well
it
was
a
rotten
way
to
be
wounded
and
flying
on
a
joke
front
like
the
Italian
In
the
Italian
hospital
we
were
going
to
form
a
society
It
had
a
funny
name
in
Italian
I
wonder
what
became
of
the
others
the
Italians
That
was
in
the
Ospedale
Maggiore
in
Milano
Padiglione
Ponte
The
next
building
was
the
Padiglione
Zonda
There
was
a
statue
of
Ponte
or
maybe
it
was
Zonda
That
was
where
the
liaison
colonel
came
to
visit
me
That
was
funny
That
was
about
the
first
funny
thing
I
was
all
bandaged
up
But
they
had
told
him
about
it
Then
he
made
that
wonderful
speech
You
a
foreigner
an
Englishman
any
foreigner
was
an
Englishman
have
given
more
than
your
life
What
a
speech
I
would
like
to
have
it
illuminated
to
hang
in
the
office
He
never
laughed
He
was
putting
himself
in
my
place
I
guess
Che
mala
fortuna
Che
mala
fortuna
I
never
used
to
realize
it
I
guess
I
try
and
play
it
along
and
just
not
make
trouble
for
people
Probably
I
never
would
have
had
any
trouble
if
I
had
n't
run
into
Brett
when
they
shipped
me
to
England
I
suppose
she
only
wanted
what
she
could
n't
have
Well
people
were
that
way
To
hell
with
people
The
Catholic
Church
had
an
awfully
good
way
of
handling
all
that
Good
advice
anyway
Not
to
think
about
it
Oh
it
was
swell
advice
Try
and
take
it
sometime
Try
and
take
it
I
lay
awake
thinking
and
my
mind
jumping
around
Then
I
could
n't
keep
away
from
it
and
I
started
to
think
about
Brett
and
all
the
rest
of
it
went
away
I
was
thinking
about
Brett
and
my
mind
stopped
jumping
around
and
started
to
go
in
sort
of
smooth
waves
Then
all
of
a
sudden
I
started
to
cry
Then
after
a
while
it
was
better
and
I
lay
in
bed
and
listened
to
the
heavy
trams
go
by
and
way
down
the
street
and
then
I
went
to
sleep
I
woke
up
There
was
a
row
going
on
outside
I
listened
and
I
thought
I
recognized
a
voice
I
put
on
a
dressing-gown
and
went
to
the
door
The
concierge
was
talking
down-stairs
She
was
very
angry
I
heard
my
name
and
called
down
the
stairs
Is
that
you
Monsieur
Barnes
the
concierge
called
Yes
It
's
me
There
's
a
species
of
woman
here
who
's
waked
the
whole
street
up
What
kind
of
a
dirty
business
at
this
time
of
night
She
says
she
must
see
you
I
've
told
her
you
're
asleep
Then
I
heard
Brett
's
voice
Half
asleep
I
had
been
sure
it
was
Georgette
I
do
n't
know
why
She
could
not
have
known
my
address
Will
you
send
her
up
please
Brett
came
up
the
stairs
I
saw
she
was
quite
drunk
Silly
thing
to
do
she
said
Make
an
awful
row
I
say
you
were
n't
asleep
were
you
What
did
you
think
I
was
doing
Do
n't
know
What
time
is
it
I
looked
at
the
clock
It
was
half-past
four
Had
no
idea
what
hour
it
was
Brett
said
I
say
can
a
chap
sit
down
Do
n't
be
cross
darling
Just
left
the
count
He
brought
me
here
What
's
he
like
I
was
getting
brandy
and
soda
and
glasses
Just
a
little
said
Brett
Do
n't
try
and
make
me
drunk
The
count
Oh
rather
He
's
quite
one
of
us
Is
he
a
count
Here
's
how
I
rather
think
so
you
know
Deserves
to
be
anyhow
Knows
hell
's
own
amount
about
people
Do
n't
know
where
he
got
it
all
Owns
a
chain
of
sweetshops
in
the
States
She
sipped
at
her
glass
Think
he
called
it
a
chain
Something
like
that
Linked
them
all
up
Told
me
a
little
about
it
Damned
interesting
He
's
one
of
us
though
Oh
quite
No
doubt
One
can
always
tell
She
took
another
drink
How
do
I
buck
on
about
all
this
You
do
n't
mind
do
you
He
's
putting
up
for
Zizi
you
know
Is
Zizi
really
a
duke
too
I
should
n't
wonder
Greek
you
know
Rotten
painter
I
rather
liked
the
count
Where
did
you
go
with
him
Oh
everywhere
He
just
brought
me
here
now
Offered
me
ten
thousand
dollars
to
go
to
Biarritz
with
him
How
much
is
that
in
pounds
Around
two
thousand
Lot
of
money
I
told
him
I
could
n't
do
it
He
was
awfully
nice
about
it
Told
him
I
knew
too
many
people
in
Biarritz
Brett
laughed
I
say
you
are
slow
on
the
up-take
she
said
I
had
only
sipped
my
brandy
and
soda
I
took
a
long
drink
That
's
better
Very
funny
Brett
said
Then
he
wanted
me
to
go
to
Cannes
with
him
Told
him
I
knew
too
many
people
in
Cannes
Monte
Carlo
Told
him
I
knew
too
many
people
in
Monte
Carlo
Told
him
I
knew
too
many
people
everywhere
Quite
true
too
So
I
asked
him
to
bring
me
here
She
looked
at
me
her
hand
on
the
table
her
glass
raised
Do
n't
look
like
that
she
said
Told
him
I
was
in
love
with
you
True
too
Do
n't
look
like
that
He
was
damn
nice
about
it
Wants
to
drive
us
out
to
dinner
to-morrow
night
Like
to
go
Why
not
I
'd
better
go
now
Why
Just
wanted
to
see
you
Damned
silly
idea
Want
to
get
dressed
and
come
down
He
's
got
the
car
just
up
the
street
The
count
Himself
And
a
chauffeur
in
livery
Going
to
drive
me
around
and
have
breakfast
in
the
Bois
Hampers
Got
it
all
at
Zelli
's
Dozen
bottles
of
Mumms
Tempt
you
I
have
to
work
in
the
morning
I
said
I
'm
too
far
behind
you
now
to
catch
up
and
be
any
fun
Do
n't
be
an
ass
Ca
n't
do
it
Right
Send
him
a
tender
message
Anything
Absolutely
Good
night
darling
Do
n't
be
sentimental
You
make
me
ill
We
kissed
good
night
and
Brett
shivered
I
'd
better
go
she
said
Good
night
darling
You
do
n't
have
to
go
Yes
We
kissed
again
on
the
stairs
and
as
I
called
for
the
cordon
the
concierge
muttered
something
behind
her
door
I
went
back
up-stairs
and
from
the
open
window
watched
Brett
walking
up
the
street
to
the
big
limousine
drawn
up
to
the
curb
under
the
arc-light
She
got
in
and
it
started
off
I
turned
around
On
the
table
was
an
empty
glass
and
a
glass
half-full
of
brandy
and
soda
I
took
them
both
out
to
the
kitchen
and
poured
the
half-full
glass
down
the
sink
I
turned
off
the
gas
in
the
dining-room
kicked
off
my
slippers
sitting
on
the
bed
and
got
into
bed
This
was
Brett
that
I
had
felt
like
crying
about
Then
I
thought
of
her
walking
up
the
street
and
stepping
into
the
car
as
I
had
last
seen
her
and
of
course
in
a
little
while
I
felt
like
hell
again
It
is
awfully
easy
to
be
hard-boiled
about
everything
in
the
daytime
but
at
night
it
is
another
thing
In
the
morning
I
walked
down
the
Boulevard
to
the
rue
Soufflot
for
coffee
and
brioche
It
was
a
fine
morning
The
horse-chestnut
trees
in
the
Luxembourg
gardens
were
in
bloom
There
was
the
pleasant
early-morning
feeling
of
a
hot
day
I
read
the
papers
with
the
coffee
and
then
smoked
a
cigarette
The
flower-women
were
coming
up
from
the
market
and
arranging
their
daily
stock
Students
went
by
going
up
to
the
law
school
or
down
to
the
Sorbonne
The
Boulevard
was
busy
with
trams
and
people
going
to
work
I
got
on
an
S
bus
and
rode
down
to
the
Madeleine
standing
on
the
back
platform
From
the
Madeleine
I
walked
along
the
Boulevard
des
Capucines
to
the
Op√©ra
and
up
to
my
office
I
passed
the
man
with
the
jumping
frogs
and
the
man
with
the
boxer
toys
I
stepped
aside
to
avoid
walking
into
the
thread
with
which
his
girl
assistant
manipulated
the
boxers
She
was
standing
looking
away
the
thread
in
her
folded
hands
The
man
was
urging
two
tourists
to
buy
Three
more
tourists
had
stopped
and
were
watching
I
walked
on
behind
a
man
who
was
pushing
a
roller
that
printed
the
name
CINZANO
on
the
sidewalk
in
damp
letters
All
along
people
were
going
to
work
It
felt
pleasant
to
be
going
to
work
I
walked
across
the
avenue
and
turned
in
to
my
office
Up-stairs
in
the
office
I
read
the
French
morning
papers
smoked
and
then
sat
at
the
typewriter
and
got
off
a
good
morning
's
work
At
eleven
o'clock
I
went
over
to
the
Quai
d'Orsay
in
a
taxi
and
went
in
and
sat
with
about
a
dozen
correspondents
while
the
foreign-office
mouthpiece
a
young
Nouvelle
Revue
Fran√ßaise
diplomat
in
horn-rimmed
spectacles
talked
and
answered
questions
for
half
an
hour
The
President
of
the
Council
was
in
Lyons
making
a
speech
or
rather
he
was
on
his
way
back
Several
people
asked
questions
to
hear
themselves
talk
and
there
were
a
couple
of
questions
asked
by
news
service
men
who
wanted
to
know
the
answers
There
was
no
news
I
shared
a
taxi
back
from
the
Quai
d'Orsay
with
Woolsey
and
Krum
What
do
you
do
nights
Jake
asked
Krum
I
never
see
you
around
Oh
I
'm
over
in
the
Quarter
I
'm
coming
over
some
night
The
Dingo
That
's
the
great
place
is
n't
it
Yes
That
or
this
new
dive
The
Select
I
've
meant
to
get
over
said
Krum
You
know
how
it
is
though
with
a
wife
and
kids
Playing
any
tennis
Woolsey
asked
Well
no
said
Krum
I
ca
n't
say
I
've
played
any
this
year
I
've
tried
to
get
away
but
Sundays
it
's
always
rained
and
the
courts
are
so
damned
crowded
The
Englishmen
all
have
Saturday
off
Woolsey
said
Lucky
beggars
said
Krum
Well
I
'll
tell
you
Some
day
I
'm
not
going
to
be
working
for
an
agency
Then
I
'll
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
out
in
the
country
That
's
the
thing
to
do
Live
out
in
the
country
and
have
a
little
car
I
've
been
thinking
some
about
getting
a
car
next
year
I
banged
on
the
glass
The
chauffeur
stopped
Here
's
my
street
I
said
Come
in
and
have
a
drink
Thanks
old
man
Krum
said
Woolsey
shook
his
head
I
've
got
to
file
that
line
he
got
off
this
morning
I
put
a
two-franc
piece
in
Krum
's
hand
You
're
crazy
Jake
he
said
This
is
on
me
It
's
all
on
the
office
anyway
Nope
I
want
to
get
it
I
waved
good-by
Krum
put
his
head
out
See
you
at
the
lunch
on
Wednesday
You
bet
I
went
to
the
office
in
the
elevator
Robert
Cohn
was
waiting
for
me
Hello
Jake
he
said
Going
out
to
lunch
Yes
Let
me
see
if
there
is
anything
new
Where
will
we
eat
Anywhere
I
was
looking
over
my
desk
Where
do
you
want
to
eat
How
about
Wetzel
's
They
've
got
good
hors
d'oeuvres
In
the
restaurant
we
ordered
hors
d'oeuvres
and
beer
The
sommelier
brought
the
beer
tall
beaded
on
the
outside
of
the
steins
and
cold
There
were
a
dozen
different
dishes
of
hors
d'oeuvres
Have
any
fun
last
night
I
asked
No
I
do
n't
think
so
How
's
the
writing
going
Rotten
I
ca
n't
get
this
second
book
going
That
happens
to
everybody
Oh
I
'm
sure
of
that
It
gets
me
worried
though
Thought
any
more
about
going
to
South
America
I
mean
that
Well
why
do
n't
you
start
off
Frances
Well
I
said
take
her
with
you
She
would
n't
like
it
That
is
n't
the
sort
of
thing
she
likes
She
likes
a
lot
of
people
around
Tell
her
to
go
to
hell
I
ca
n't
I
've
got
certain
obligations
to
her
He
shoved
the
sliced
cucumbers
away
and
took
a
pickled
herring
What
do
you
know
about
Lady
Brett
Ashley
Jake
Her
name
's
Lady
Ashley
Brett
's
her
own
name
She
's
a
nice
girl
I
said
She
's
getting
a
divorce
and
she
's
going
to
marry
Mike
Campbell
He
's
over
in
Scotland
now
Why
She
's
a
remarkably
attractive
woman
Is
n't
she
There
's
a
certain
quality
about
her
a
certain
fineness
She
seems
to
be
absolutely
fine
and
straight
She
's
very
nice
I
do
n't
know
how
to
describe
the
quality
Cohn
said
I
suppose
it
's
breeding
You
sound
as
though
you
liked
her
pretty
well
I
do
I
should
n't
wonder
if
I
were
in
love
with
her
She
's
a
drunk
I
said
She
's
in
love
with
Mike
Campbell
and
she
's
going
to
marry
him
He
's
going
to
be
rich
as
hell
some
day
I
do
n't
believe
she
'll
ever
marry
him
Why
not
I
do
n't
know
I
just
do
n't
believe
it
Have
you
known
her
a
long
time
Yes
I
said
She
was
a
V
A
D
in
a
hospital
I
was
in
during
the
war
She
must
have
been
just
a
kid
then
She
's
thirty-four
now
When
did
she
marry
Ashley
During
the
war
Her
own
true
love
had
just
kicked
off
with
the
dysentery
You
talk
sort
of
bitter
Sorry
I
did
n't
mean
to
I
was
just
trying
to
give
you
the
facts
I
do
n't
believe
she
would
marry
anybody
she
did
n't
love
Well
I
said
She
's
done
it
twice
I
do
n't
believe
it
Well
I
said
do
n't
ask
me
a
lot
of
fool
questions
if
you
do
n't
like
the
answers
I
did
n't
ask
you
that
You
asked
me
what
I
knew
about
Brett
Ashley
I
did
n't
ask
you
to
insult
her
Oh
go
to
hell
He
stood
up
from
the
table
his
face
white
and
stood
there
white
and
angry
behind
the
little
plates
of
hors
d'oeuvres
Sit
down
I
said
Do
n't
be
