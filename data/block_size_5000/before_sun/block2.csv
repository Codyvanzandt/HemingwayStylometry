gentleman
looked
back
and
shouted
something
The
wife
stopped
lagging
behind
and
walked
up
Everyone
they
met
walking
through
the
main
street
of
the
town
Peduzzi
greeted
elaborately
Buon
d
Arturo
Tipping
his
hat
The
bank
clerk
stared
at
him
from
the
door
of
the
Fascist
caf
Groups
of
three
and
four
people
standing
in
front
of
the
shops
stared
at
the
three
The
workmen
in
their
stone-powdered
jackets
working
on
the
foundations
of
the
new
hotel
looked
up
as
they
passed
Nobody
spoke
or
gave
any
sign
to
them
except
the
town
beggar
lean
and
old
with
a
spittle-thickened
beard
who
lifted
his
hat
as
they
passed
Peduzzi
stopped
in
front
of
a
store
with
the
window
full
of
bottles
and
brought
his
empty
grappa
bottle
from
an
inside
pocket
of
his
old
military
coat
A
little
to
drink
some
marsala
for
the
Signora
something
something
to
drink
He
gestured
with
the
bottle
It
was
a
wonderful
day
Marsala
you
like
marsala
Signorina
A
little
marsala
The
wife
stood
sullenly
You
'll
have
to
play
up
to
this
she
said
I
ca
n't
understand
a
word
he
says
He
's
drunk
is
n't
he
The
young
gentleman
appeared
not
to
hear
Peduzzi
He
was
thinking
what
in
hell
makes
him
say
marsala
That
's
what
Max
Beerbohm
drinks
Geld
Peduzzi
said
finally
taking
hold
of
the
young
gentleman
's
sleeve
Lire
He
smiled
reluctant
to
press
the
subject
but
needing
to
bring
the
young
gentleman
into
action
The
young
gentleman
took
out
his
pocket
book
and
gave
him
a
ten
lire
note
Peduzzi
went
up
the
steps
to
the
door
of
the
Specialty
of
Domestic
and
Foreign
Wines
shop
It
was
locked
It
is
closed
until
two
someone
passing
in
the
street
said
scornfully
Peduzzi
came
down
the
steps
He
felt
hurt
Never
mind
he
said
we
can
get
it
at
the
Concordia
They
walked
down
the
road
to
the
Concordia
three
abreast
On
the
porch
of
the
Concordia
where
the
rusty
bobsleds
were
stacked
the
young
gentleman
said
Was
wollen
Sie
Peduzzi
handed
him
the
ten
lira
note
folded
over
and
over
Nothing
he
said
Anything
He
was
embarrassed
Marsala
maybe
I
do
n't
know
Marsala
The
door
of
the
Concordia
shut
on
the
young
gentleman
and
the
wife
Three
marsalas
said
the
y
g
to
the
girl
behind
the
pastry
counter
Two
you
mean
she
asked
No
he
said
one
for
a
vecchio
Oh
she
said
a
vecchio
and
laughed
getting
down
the
bottle
She
poured
out
the
three
muddy
looking
drinks
into
three
glasses
The
wife
was
sitting
at
a
table
under
the
line
of
newspapers
on
sticks
The
y
g
put
one
of
the
marsalas
in
front
of
her
You
might
as
well
drink
it
he
said
maybe
it
'll
make
you
feel
better
She
sat
and
looked
at
the
glass
The
y
g
went
outside
the
door
with
a
glass
for
Peduzzi
but
could
not
see
him
I
do
n't
know
where
he
is
he
said
coming
back
into
the
pastry
room
carrying
the
glass
He
wanted
a
quart
of
it
said
the
wife
How
much
is
a
quarter
litre
the
y
g
asked
the
girl
Of
the
bianco
One
lira
No
of
the
marsala
Put
these
two
in
too
he
said
giving
her
his
own
glass
and
the
one
poured
for
Peduzzi
She
filled
the
quarter
litre
wine
measure
with
a
funnel
A
bottle
to
carry
it
said
the
y
g
She
went
to
hunt
for
a
bottle
It
all
amused
her
I
'm
sorry
you
feel
so
rotten
Tiny
he
said
I
'm
sorry
I
talked
the
way
I
did
at
lunch
We
were
both
getting
at
the
same
thing
from
different
angles
It
does
n't
make
any
difference
she
said
None
of
it
makes
any
difference
Are
you
too
cold
he
asked
I
wish
you
'd
worn
another
sweater
I
've
got
on
three
sweaters
The
girl
came
in
with
a
very
slim
brown
bottle
and
poured
the
marsala
into
it
The
y
g
paid
five
lire
more
They
went
out
the
door
The
girl
was
amused
Peduzzi
was
walking
up
and
down
at
the
other
end
out
of
the
wind
and
holding
the
rods
Come
on
he
said
I
will
carry
the
rods
What
difference
does
it
make
if
anybody
sees
them
No
one
will
trouble
us
No
one
will
make
any
trouble
for
me
in
Cortina
I
know
them
at
the
municipio
I
have
been
a
soldier
Everybody
in
this
town
likes
me
I
sell
frogs
What
if
it
is
forbidden
to
fish
Not
a
thing
Nothing
No
trouble
Big
trout
I
tell
you
Lots
of
them
They
were
walking
down
the
hill
toward
the
river
The
town
was
in
back
of
them
The
sun
had
gone
under
and
it
was
sprinkling
rain
There
said
Peduzzi
pointing
to
a
girl
in
the
doorway
of
a
house
they
passed
My
daughter
His
doctor
the
wife
said
has
he
got
to
show
us
his
doctor
He
said
his
daughter
said
the
y
g
The
girl
went
into
the
house
as
Peduzzi
pointed
They
walked
down
the
hill
across
the
fields
and
then
turned
to
follow
the
river
bank
Peduzzi
talked
rapidly
with
much
winking
and
knowingness
As
they
walked
three
abreast
the
wife
caught
his
breath
across
the
wind
Once
he
nudged
her
in
the
ribs
Part
of
the
time
he
talked
in
D'Ampezzo
dialect
and
and
sometimes
in
Tyroler
German
dialect
He
could
not
make
out
which
the
young
gentleman
and
his
wife
understood
the
best
so
he
was
being
bilingual
But
as
the
young
gentleman
said
Ja
Ja
Peduzzi
decided
to
talk
altogether
in
Tyroler
The
young
gentleman
and
the
wife
understood
nothing
Everybody
in
the
town
saw
us
going
through
with
these
rods
We
're
probably
being
followed
by
the
game
police
now
I
wish
we
were
n't
in
on
this
damn
thing
This
damned
old
fool
is
so
drunk
too
Of
course
you
have
n't
got
the
guts
to
just
go
back
said
the
wife
Of
course
you
have
to
go
on
Why
do
n't
you
go
back
Go
on
back
Tiny
I
'm
going
to
stay
with
you
If
you
go
to
jail
we
might
as
well
both
go
They
turned
sharp
down
the
bank
and
Peduzzi
stood
his
coat
blowing
in
the
wind
gesturing
at
the
river
It
was
brown
and
muddy
Off
on
the
right
there
was
a
dump
heap
Say
it
to
me
in
Italian
said
the
young
gentleman
Un
mezz'ora
Piu
d
un
mezz'ora
He
says
it
's
at
least
a
half
hour
more
Go
on
back
Tiny
You
're
cold
in
this
wind
anyway
It
's
a
rotten
day
and
we
are
n't
going
to
have
any
fun
anyway
All
right
she
said
and
climbed
up
the
grassy
bank
Peduzzi
was
down
at
the
river
and
did
not
notice
her
till
she
was
almost
out
of
sight
over
the
crest
Frau
he
shouted
Frau
Fraulein
You
're
not
going
She
went
on
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
She
's
gone
said
Peduzzi
It
shocked
him
He
took
off
the
rubber
bands
that
held
the
rod
segments
together
and
commenced
to
joint
up
one
of
the
rods
But
you
said
it
was
half
an
hour
further
Oh
yes
It
is
good
half
an
hour
down
It
is
good
here
too
Really
Of
course
It
is
good
here
and
good
there
too
The
y.g
sat
down
on
the
bank
and
jointed
up
a
rod
put
on
the
reel
and
threaded
the
line
through
the
guides
He
felt
uncomfortable
and
afraid
that
any
minute
a
gamekeeper
or
a
posse
of
citizens
would
come
over
the
bank
from
the
town
He
could
see
the
houses
of
the
town
and
the
campanile
over
the
edge
of
the
hill
He
opened
his
leader
box
Peduzzi
leaned
over
and
dug
his
flat
hard
thumb
and
forefinger
in
and
tangled
the
moistened
leaders
Have
you
some
lead
No
You
must
have
some
lead
Peduzzi
was
excited
You
must
have
piombo
Piombo
A
little
piombo
Just
here
Just
above
the
hook
or
your
bait
will
float
on
the
water
You
must
have
it
Just
a
little
piombo
Have
you
got
some
No
He
looked
through
his
pockets
desperately
Sifting
through
the
cloth
dirt
in
the
linings
of
his
inside
military
pockets
I
have
n't
any
We
must
have
piombo
We
ca
n't
fish
then
said
the
y
g
and
unjointed
the
rod
reeling
the
line
back
through
the
guides
We
'll
get
some
piombo
and
fish
tomorrow
But
listen
caro
you
must
have
piombo
The
line
will
lie
flat
on
the
water
Peduzzi
's
day
was
going
to
pieces
before
his
eyes
You
must
have
piombo
A
little
is
enough
Your
stuff
is
all
clean
and
new
but
you
have
no
lead
I
would
have
brought
some
You
said
you
had
everything
The
y
g
looked
at
the
stream
discolored
by
the
melting
snow
I
know
he
said
we
'll
get
some
piombo
and
fish
tomorrow
At
what
hour
in
the
morning
Tell
me
that
At
seven
The
sun
came
out
It
was
warm
and
pleasant
The
young
gentleman
felt
relieved
He
was
no
longer
breaking
the
law
Sitting
on
the
bank
he
took
the
bottle
of
marsala
out
of
his
pocket
and
passed
it
to
Peduzzi
Peduzzi
passed
it
back
The
y
g
took
a
drink
of
it
and
passed
it
to
Peduzzi
again
Peduzzi
passed
it
back
again
Drink
he
said
drink
It
's
your
marsala
After
another
short
drink
the
y
g
handed
the
bottle
over
Peduzzi
had
been
watching
it
closely
He
took
the
bottle
very
hurriedly
and
tipped
it
up
The
gray
hairs
in
the
folds
of
his
neck
oscillated
as
he
drank
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
end
of
the
narrow
brown
bottle
He
drank
it
all
The
sun
shone
while
he
drank
It
was
wonderful
This
was
a
great
day
after
all
A
wonderful
day
Senta
caro
In
the
morning
at
seven
He
had
called
the
young
gentleman
caro
several
times
and
nothing
had
happened
It
was
good
marsala
His
eyes
glistened
Days
like
this
stretched
out
ahead
It
would
begin
at
seven
in
the
morning
They
started
to
walk
up
the
hill
toward
the
town
The
young
gentleman
went
on
ahead
He
was
quite
a
way
up
the
hill
Peduzzi
called
to
him
Listen
caro
can
you
let
me
take
five
lira
for
a
favor
For
today
asked
the
young
gentleman
frowning
No
not
today
Give
it
to
me
today
for
tomorrow
I
will
provide
everything
for
tomorrow
Pane
salami
formaggio
good
stuff
for
all
of
us
You
and
I
and
the
signora
Bait
for
fishing
minnows
not
worms
only
Perhaps
I
can
get
some
marsala
All
for
five
lira
Five
lira
for
a
favor
The
young
gentleman
looked
through
his
pocketbook
and
took
out
a
two-lira
note
and
two
ones
Thank
you
caro
Thank
you
said
Peduzzi
in
the
tone
of
one
member
of
the
Carleton
Club
accepting
the
Morning
Post
from
another
This
was
living
He
was
through
with
the
hotel
garden
breaking
up
frozen
manure
with
a
dung
fork
Life
was
opening
out
Until
seven
o'clock
then
caro
he
said
slapping
the
y
g
on
the
back
Promptly
at
seven
I
may
not
be
going
said
the
young
gentleman
putting
his
purse
back
in
his
pocket
What
said
Peduzzi
I
will
have
minnows
Signor
Salami
everything
You
and
I
and
the
Signora
The
three
of
us
I
may
not
be
going
said
the
y
g
very
probably
not
I
will
leave
word
with
the
padrone
at
the
hotel
office
Jim
Gilmore
came
to
Hortons
Bay
from
Canada
He
bought
the
blacksmith
shop
from
old
man
Horton
Jim
was
short
and
dark
with
big
mustaches
and
big
hands
He
was
a
good
horseshoer
and
did
not
look
much
like
a
blacksmith
even
with
his
leather
apron
on
He
lived
upstairs
above
the
blacksmith
shop
and
took
his
meals
at
A
J
Smith
's
Liz
Coates
worked
for
Smith
's
Mrs
Smith
who
was
a
very
large
clean
woman
said
Liz
Coates
was
the
neatest
girl
she
'd
ever
seen
Liz
had
good
legs
and
always
wore
clean
gingham
aprons
and
Jim
noticed
that
her
hair
was
always
neat
behind
He
liked
her
face
because
it
was
so
jolly
but
he
never
thought
about
her
Liz
liked
Jim
very
much
She
liked
the
way
he
walked
over
from
the
shop
and
often
went
to
the
kitchen
door
to
watch
for
him
to
start
down
the
road
She
liked
it
about
his
mustache
She
liked
it
about
how
white
his
teeth
were
when
he
smiled
She
liked
it
very
much
that
he
did
n't
look
like
a
blacksmith
She
liked
it
how
much
A
J
Smith
and
Mrs
Smith
liked
Jim
One
day
she
found
that
she
liked
it
the
way
the
hair
was
black
on
his
arms
and
how
white
they
were
above
the
tanned
line
when
he
washed
up
in
the
washbasin
outside
the
house
Liking
that
made
her
feel
funny
Hortons
Bay
the
town
was
only
five
houses
on
the
main
road
between
Boyne
City
and
Charlevoix
There
was
the
general
store
and
post
office
with
a
high
false
front
and
maybe
a
wagon
hitched
out
in
front
Smith
's
house
Stroud
's
house
Fox
's
house
Horton
's
house
and
Van
Hoosen
's
house
The
houses
were
in
a
big
grove
of
elm
trees
and
the
road
was
very
sandy
There
was
farming
country
and
timber
each
way
up
the
road
Up
the
road
a
ways
was
the
Methodist
church
and
down
the
road
the
other
direction
was
the
township
school
The
blacksmith
shop
was
painted
red
and
faced
the
school
A
steep
sandy
road
ran
down
the
hill
to
the
bay
through
the
timber
From
Smith
's
back
door
you
could
look
out
across
the
woods
that
ran
down
to
the
lake
and
across
the
bay
It
was
very
beautiful
in
the
spring
and
summer
the
sky
blue
and
bright
and
usually
whitecaps
on
the
lake
beyond
the
point
from
the
breeze
blowing
in
from
Charlevoix
and
Lake
Michigan
From
Smith
's
back
door
Liz
could
see
ore
barges
way
out
in
the
lake
going
toward
Boyne
City
When
she
looked
at
them
they
did
n't
seem
to
be
moving
at
all
but
if
she
went
in
and
dried
some
more
dishes
and
then
came
out
again
they
would
be
out
of
sight
beyond
the
point
All
the
time
now
Liz
was
thinking
about
Jim
Gilmore
He
did
n't
seem
to
notice
her
very
much
He
talked
about
the
shop
to
A.J
Smith
and
about
the
Republican
Party
and
about
James
G
Blaine
In
the
evenings
he
read
The
Toledo
Blade
and
the
Grand
Rapids
paper
by
the
lamp
in
the
front
room
or
went
out
spearing
fish
in
the
bay
with
a
jacklight
with
A.J
Smith
In
the
fall
he
and
Smith
and
Charley
Wyman
took
a
wagon
and
tent
grubs
axes
their
rifles
and
two
dogs
and
went
on
a
trip
to
the
pine
plains
beyond
Vanderbilt
deer
hunting
Liz
and
Mrs
Smith
were
cooking
for
four
days
for
them
before
they
started
Liz
wanted
to
make
something
special
for
Jim
to
take
but
she
did
n't
finally
because
she
was
afraid
to
ask
Mrs
Smith
for
the
eggs
and
flour
and
afraid
if
she
bought
them
Mrs
Smith
would
catch
her
cooking
It
would
have
been
all
right
with
Mrs
Smith
but
Liz
was
afraid
All
the
time
Jim
was
gone
on
the
deer
hunting
trip
Liz
thought
about
him
It
was
awful
while
he
was
gone
She
could
n't
sleep
well
from
thinking
about
him
but
she
discovered
it
was
fun
to
think
about
him
too
If
she
let
herself
go
it
was
better
The
night
before
they
were
to
come
back
she
did
n't
sleep
at
all
because
it
was
all
mixed
up
in
a
dream
about
not
sleeping
and
really
not
sleeping
When
she
saw
the
wagon
coming
down
the
she
felt
weak
and
sick
sort
of
inside
She
could
n't
wait
till
she
saw
Jim
and
it
seemed
as
though
everything
would
be
all
right
when
he
came
The
wagon
stopped
outside
under
the
big
elm
and
Mrs
Smith
and
Liz
went
out
All
the
men
had
beards
and
there
were
three
deer
in
the
back
of
the
wagon
their
thin
legs
sticking
stiff
over
the
edge
of
the
wagon
box
Mrs
Smith
kissed
Alonzo
and
he
hugged
her
Jim
said
Hello
Liz
and
grinned
Liz
had
n't
known
just
what
would
happen
when
Jim
got
back
but
she
was
sure
it
would
be
something
Nothing
had
happened
The
men
were
just
home
that
was
all
Jim
pulled
the
burlap
sacks
off
the
deer
and
Liz
looked
at
them
One
was
a
big
buck
It
was
stiff
and
hard
to
lift
out
of
the
wagon
Did
you
shoot
it
Jim
Liz
asked
Yeah
Ai
n't
it
a
beauty
Jim
got
it
onto
his
back
to
carry
it
to
the
smokehouse
That
night
Charley
Wyman
stayed
to
supper
at
Smith
's
It
was
too
late
to
get
back
to
Charlevoix
The
men
washed
up
and
waited
in
the
front
room
for
supper
Ai
n't
there
something
left
in
that
crock
Jimmy
A.J
Smith
asked
and
Jim
went
out
to
the
wagon
in
the
barn
and
fetched
in
the
jug
of
whiskey
the
men
had
taken
hunting
with
them
It
was
a
four
gallon
jug
and
there
was
quite
a
little
slopped
back
and
forth
in
the
bottom
Jim
took
a
long
pull
on
his
way
back
to
the
house
It
was
hard
to
lift
such
a
big
jug
up
to
drink
out
of
it
Some
of
the
whiskey
ran
down
on
his
shirt
front
The
two
men
smiled
when
Jim
came
in
with
the
jug
A.J
Smith
sent
for
glasses
and
Liz
brought
them
A.J
poured
out
three
big
shots
Well
here
's
looking
at
you
A.J
said
Charley
Wyman
That
damn
big
buck
Jimmy
said
A.J
Here
's
all
the
ones
we
missed
A.J
said
Jim
and
downed
his
liquor
Tastes
good
to
a
man
Nothing
like
it
this
time
of
year
for
what
ails
you
How
about
another
boys
Here
's
how
A.J
Down
the
creek
boys
Here
's
to
next
year
Jim
began
to
feel
great
He
loved
the
taste
and
the
feel
of
whiskey
He
was
glad
to
be
back
to
a
comfortable
bed
and
warm
food
and
the
shop
He
had
another
drink
The
men
came
in
to
supper
feeling
hilarious
but
acting
very
respectable
Liz
sat
at
the
table
after
she
put
on
the
food
and
ate
with
the
family
It
was
a
good
dinner
The
men
ate
seriously
After
supper
they
went
into
the
front
room
again
and
Liz
cleaned
up
with
Mrs
Smith
Then
Mrs
Smith
went
upstairs
and
pretty
soon
Smith
came
out
and
went
upstairs
too
Jim
and
Charley
were
still
in
the
front
room
Liz
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
next
to
the
stove
pretending
to
read
a
book
and
thinking
about
Jim
She
did
n't
want
to
go
to
bed
yet
because
she
knew
Jim
would
be
coming
out
and
she
wanted
to
see
him
as
he
went
out
so
she
could
take
the
way
he
looked
up
to
bed
with
her
She
was
thinking
about
him
hard
and
then
Jim
came
out
His
eyes
were
shining
and
his
hair
was
a
little
rumpled
Liz
looked
down
at
her
book
Jim
came
over
back
of
her
chair
and
stood
there
and
she
could
feel
him
breathing
and
then
he
put
his
arms
around
her
Her
breasts
felt
plump
and
firm
and
the
nipples
were
erect
under
his
hands
Liz
was
terribly
frightened
no
one
had
ever
touched
her
but
she
thought
He
's
come
to
me
finally
He
's
really
come
She
held
herself
stiff
because
she
was
so
frightened
and
did
not
know
anything
else
to
do
and
then
Jim
held
her
tight
against
the
chair
and
kissed
her
It
was
such
a
sharp
aching
hurting
feeling
that
she
thought
she
could
n't
stand
it
She
felt
Jim
right
through
the
back
of
the
chair
and
she
could
n't
stand
it
and
then
something
clicked
inside
of
her
and
the
feeling
was
warmer
and
softer
Jim
held
her
tight
hard
against
the
chair
and
she
wanted
it
now
and
Jim
whispered
Come
on
for
a
walk
Liz
took
her
coat
off
the
peg
on
the
kitchen
wall
and
they
went
out
the
door
Jim
had
his
arm
around
her
and
every
little
way
they
stopped
and
pressed
against
each
other
and
Jim
kissed
her
There
was
no
moon
and
they
walked
ankle-deep
in
the
sandy
road
through
the
trees
down
to
the
dock
and
the
warehouse
on
the
bay
The
water
was
lapping
in
the
piles
and
the
point
was
dark
across
the
bay
It
was
cold
but
Liz
was
hot
all
over
from
being
with
Jim
They
sat
down
in
the
shelter
of
the
warehouse
and
Jim
pulled
Liz
close
to
him
She
was
frightened
One
of
Jim
's
hands
went
inside
her
dress
and
stroked
over
her
breast
and
the
other
hand
was
in
her
lap
She
was
very
frightened
and
did
n't
know
how
he
was
going
to
go
about
things
but
she
snuggled
close
to
him
Then
the
hand
that
felt
so
big
in
her
lap
went
away
and
was
on
her
leg
and
started
to
move
up
it
Do
n't
Jim
Liz
said
Jim
slid
the
hand
further
up
You
mus
n't
Jim
You
mus
n't
Neither
Jim
nor
Jim
's
big
hand
paid
any
attention
to
her
The
boards
were
hard
Jim
had
her
dress
up
and
was
trying
to
do
something
to
her
She
was
frightened
but
she
wanted
it
She
had
to
have
it
but
it
frightened
her
You
mus
n't
do
it
Jim
You
mus
n't
I
got
to
I
'm
going
to
You
know
we
got
to
No
we
have
n't
Jim
We
ai
n't
got
to
Oh
it
is
n't
right
Oh
it
's
so
big
and
it
hurts
so
You
ca
n't
Oh
Jim
Jim
Oh
The
hemlock
planks
of
the
dock
were
hard
and
splintery
and
cold
and
Jim
was
heavy
on
her
and
he
had
hurt
her
Liz
pushed
him
she
was
so
uncomfortable
and
cramped
Jim
was
asleep
He
would
n't
move
She
worked
out
from
under
him
and
sat
up
and
straightened
her
skirt
and
coat
and
tried
to
do
something
with
her
hair
Jim
was
sleeping
with
his
mouth
a
little
open
Liz
leaned
over
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
He
was
still
asleep
She
lifted
his
head
a
little
and
shook
it
He
rolled
his
head
over
and
swallowed
Liz
started
to
cry
She
walked
over
to
the
edge
of
the
dock
and
looked
down
to
the
water
There
was
a
mist
coming
up
from
the
bay
She
was
cold
and
miserable
and
everything
felt
gone
She
walked
back
to
where
Jim
was
lying
and
shook
him
once
more
to
make
sure
She
was
crying
Jim
she
said
Jim
Please
Jim
Jim
stirred
and
curled
a
little
tighter
Liz
took
off
her
coat
and
leaned
over
and
covered
him
with
it
She
tucked
it
around
him
neatly
and
carefully
Then
she
walked
across
the
dock
and
up
the
steep
sandy
road
to
go
to
bed
A
cold
mist
was
coming
up
through
the
woods
from
the
bay
Yogi
Johnson
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
of
a
big
pump-factory
in
Michigan
Spring
would
soon
be
here
Could
it
be
that
what
this
writing
fellow
Hutchinson
had
said
If
winter
comes
can
spring
be
far
behind
would
be
true
again
this
year
Yogi
Johnson
wondered
Near
Yogi
at
the
next
window
but
one
stood
Scripps
O
Neil
a
tall
lean
man
with
a
tall
lean
face
Both
stood
and
looked
out
at
the
empty
yard
of
the
pump-factory
Snow
covered
the
crated
pumps
that
would
soon
be
shipped
away
Once
the
spring
should
come
and
the
snow
melt
workmen
from
the
factory
would
break
out
the
pumps
from
piles
where
they
were
snowed
in
and
haul
them
down
to
the
G
R
I
station
where
they
would
be
loaded
on
flat-cars
and
shipped
away
Yogi
Johnson
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
snowed-in
pumps
and
his
breath
made
little
fairy
tracings
on
the
cold
windowpane
Yogi
Johnson
thought
of
Paris
Perhaps
it
was
the
little
fairy
tracings
that
reminded
him
of
the
gay
city
where
he
had
once
spent
two
weeks
Two
weeks
that
were
to
have
been
the
happiest
weeks
of
his
life
That
was
all
behind
him
now
That
and
everything
else
Scripps
O
Neil
had
two
wives
As
he
looked
out
of
the
window
standing
tall
and
lean
and
resilient
with
his
own
tenuous
hardness
he
thought
of
both
of
them
One
lived
in
Mancelona
and
the
other
lived
in
Petoskey
He
had
not
seen
the
wife
who
lived
in
Mancelona
since
last
spring
He
looked
out
at
the
snow-covered
pump-yards
and
thought
what
spring
would
mean
With
his
wife
in
Mancelona
Scripps
often
got
drunk
When
he
was
drunk
he
and
his
wife
were
happy
They
would
go
down
together
to
the
railway
station
and
walk
out
along
the
tracks
and
then
sit
together
and
drink
and
watch
the
trains
go
by
They
would
sit
under
a
pine-tree
on
a
little
hill
that
overlooked
the
railway
and
drink
Sometimes
they
drank
all
night
Sometimes
they
drank
for
a
week
at
a
time
It
did
them
good
It
made
Scripps
strong
Scripps
had
a
daughter
whom
he
playfully
called
Lousy
O
Neil
Her
real
name
was
Lucy
O
Neil
One
night
after
Scripps
and
his
old
woman
had
been
out
drinking
on
the
railroad
line
for
three
or
four
days
he
lost
his
wife
He
didn
t
know
where
she
was
When
he
came
to
himself
everything
was
dark
He
walked
along
the
railroad
track
toward
town
The
ties
were
stiff
and
hard
under
his
feet
He
tried
walking
on
the
rails
He
couldn
t
do
it
He
had
the
dope
on
that
all
right
He
went
back
to
walking
along
the
ties
It
was
a
long
way
into
town
Finally
he
came
to
where
he
could
see
the
lights
of
the
switch-yard
He
cut
away
from
the
tracks
and
passed
the
Mancelona
High
School
It
was
a
yellow-brick
building
There
was
nothing
rococo
about
it
like
the
buildings
he
had
seen
in
Paris
No
he
had
never
been
in
Paris
That
was
not
he
That
was
his
friend
Yogi
Johnson
Yogi
Johnson
looked
out
of
the
window
Soon
it
would
be
time
to
shut
the
pump-factory
for
the
night
He
opened
the
window
carefully
just
a
crack
Just
a
crack
but
that
was
enough
Outside
in
the
yard
the
snow
had
begun
to
melt
A
warm
breeze
was
blowing
A
chinook
wind
the
pump
fellows
called
it
The
warm
chinook
wind
came
in
through
the
window
into
the
pump-factory
All
the
workmen
laid
down
their
tools
Many
of
them
were
Indians
The
foreman
was
a
short
iron-jawed
man
He
had
once
made
a
trip
as
far
as
Duluth
Duluth
was
far
across
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake
in
the
hills
of
Minnesota
A
wonderful
thing
had
happened
to
him
there
The
foreman
put
his
finger
in
his
mouth
to
moisten
it
and
held
it
up
in
the
air
He
felt
the
warm
breeze
on
his
finger
He
shook
his
head
ruefully
and
smiled
at
the
men
a
little
grimly
perhaps
Well
it
s
a
regular
chinook
boys
he
said
Silently
for
the
most
part
the
workmen
hung
up
their
tools
The
half-completed
pumps
were
put
away
in
their
racks
The
workmen
filed
some
of
them
talking
others
silent
a
few
muttering
to
the
washroom
to
wash
up
Outside
through
the
window
came
the
sound
of
an
Indian
war-whoop
Scripps
O
Neil
stood
outside
the
Mancelona
High
School
looking
up
at
the
lighted
windows
It
was
dark
and
the
snow
was
falling
It
had
been
falling
ever
since
Scripps
could
remember
A
passer-by
stopped
and
stared
at
Scripps
After
all
what
was
this
man
to
him
He
went
on
Scripps
stood
in
the
snow
and
stared
up
at
the
lighted
windows
of
the
High
School
Inside
there
people
were
learning
things
Far
into
the
night
they
worked
the
boys
vying
with
the
girls
in
their
search
for
knowledge
this
urge
for
the
learning
of
things
that
was
sweeping
America
His
girl
little
Lousy
a
girl
that
had
cost
him
a
cool
seventy-five
dollars
in
doctors
bills
was
in
there
learning
Scripps
was
proud
It
was
too
late
for
him
to
learn
but
there
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
Lousy
was
learning
She
had
the
stuff
in
her
that
girl
Scripps
went
on
up
to
his
house
It
was
not
a
big
house
but
it
wasn
t
size
that
mattered
to
Scripps
s
old
woman
Scripps
she
often
said
when
they
were
drinking
together
I
don
t
want
a
palace
All
I
want
is
a
place
to
keep
the
wind
out
Scripps
had
taken
her
at
her
word
Now
as
he
walked
in
the
late
evening
through
the
snow
and
saw
the
lights
of
his
own
home
he
felt
glad
that
he
had
taken
her
at
her
word
It
was
better
this
way
than
if
he
were
coming
home
to
a
palace
He
Scripps
was
not
the
sort
of
chap
that
wanted
a
palace
He
opened
the
door
of
his
house
and
went
in
Something
kept
going
through
his
head
He
tried
to
get
it
out
but
it
was
no
good
What
was
it
that
poet
chap
his
friend
Harry
Parker
had
met
once
in
Detroit
had
written
Harry
used
to
recite
it
Through
pleasures
and
palaces
though
I
may
roam
When
you
