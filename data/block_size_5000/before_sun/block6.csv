The

Yogi
in
the
starlight
saw
that
he
had
lost
one
of
his
artificial
arms
Me

the
little
Indian
sobbed
He
shook
his
one
arm
at
the
window
of
the
club
from
which
a
thin
slit
of
light
came
Club

Never

Yogi
said
to
the
little
Indian
I

The
little
Indian
went
on
crying
He
sat
down
in
the
snowy
road
No

about
nothing

said
From
above

out

window
of

came
the
haunting

of
a

Author
s
Note
to
the
Reader
In
case
it
may
have
any
historical
value
I
am
glad
to
state
that
I
wrote
the
foregoing
chapter
in
two
hours
directly
on
the
typewriter
and
then
went
out
to
lunch
with
John
Dos
Passos
whom
I
consider
a
very
forceful
writer
and
an
exceedingly
pleasant
fellow
besides
This
is
what
is
known
in
the
provinces
as
log-rolling
We
lunched
on
rollmops
Sole
Meuni
re
Civet
de
Li
vre
la
Chez
Cocotte
marmelade
de
pommes
and
washed
it
all
down
as
we
used
to
say
eh
reader
with
a
bottle
of
Montrachet
1919
with
the
sole
and
a
bottle
of
Hospice
de
Beaune
1919
apiece
with
the
jugged
hare
Mr
Dos
Passos
I
believe
shared
a
bottle
of
Chambertin
with
me
over
the
marmelade
de
pommes
Eng
apple
sauce
We
drank
two
vieux
marcs
and
after
deciding
not
to
go
to
the
Caf
du
D
me
and
talk
about
Art
we
both
went
to
our
respective
homes
and
I
wrote
the
following
chapter
I
would
like
the
reader
to
particularly
remark
the
way
the
complicated
threads
of
the
lives
of
the
various
characters
in
the
book
are
gathered
together
and
then
held
there
in
that
memorable
scene
in
the
beanery
It
was
when
I
read
this
chapter
aloud
to
him
that
Mr
Dos
Passos
exclaimed
Hemingway
you
have
wrought
a
masterpiece
P
S
From
the
Author
to
the
Reader
It
is
at
this
point
reader
that
I
am
going
to
try
and
get
that
sweep
and
movement
into
the
book
that
shows
that
the
book
is
really
a
great
book
I
know
you
hope
just
as
much
as
I
do
reader
that
I
will
get
this
sweep
and
movement
because
think
what
it
will
mean
to
both
of
us
Mr
H
G
Wells
who
has
been
visiting
at
our
home
we
re
getting
along
in
the
literary
game
eh
reader
asked
us
the
other
day
if
perhaps
our
reader
that
s
you
reader
just
think
of
it
H
G
Wells
talking
about
you
right
in
our
home
Anyway
H
G
Wells
asked
us
if
perhaps
our
reader
would
not
think
too
much
of
this
story
was
autobiographical
Please
reader
just
get
that
idea
out
of
your
head
We
have
lived
in
Petoskey
Mich
it
is
true
and
naturally
many
of
the
characters
are
drawn
from
life
as
we
lived
it
then
But
they
are
other
people
not
the
author
The
author
only
comes
into
the
story
in
these
little
notes
It
is
true
that
before
starting
this
story
we
spent
twelve
years
studying
the
various
Indian
dialects
of
the
North
and
there
is
still
preserved
in
the
museum
at
Cross
Village
our
translation
of
the
New
Testament
into
Ojibway
But
you
would
have
done
the
same
thing
in
our
place
reader
and
I
think
if
you
think
it
over
you
will
agree
with
us
on
this
Now
to
get
back
to
the
story
It
is
meant
in
the
best
spirit
of
friendship
when
I
say
that
you
have
no
idea
reader
what
a
hard
chapter
this
is
going
to
be
to
write
As
a
matter
of
fact
and
I
try
to
be
frank
about
these
things
we
will
not
even
try
and
write
it
until
tomorrow
Part
Four
The
Passing
of
a
Great
Race
and
the
Making
and
Marring
of
Americans
But
perhaps
it
may
be
objected
to
me
that
I
have
against
my
own
rules
introduced
vices
and
of
a
very
black
kind
into
this
work
To
which
I
shall
answer
first
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
pursue
a
series
of
human
actions
and
keep
clear
from
them
Secondly
that
the
vices
to
be
found
here
are
rather
the
accidental
consequences
of
some
human
frailty
or
foible
than
causes
habitually
existing
in
the
mind
Thirdly
that
they
are
never
set
forth
as
the
objects
of
ridicule
but
detestation
Fourthly
that
they
are
never
the
principal
figure
at
that
time
on
the
scene
and
lastly
they
never
produce
the
intended
evil
HENRY
FIELDING
Yogi
Johnson
walking
down
the
silent
street
with
his
arm
around
the
little
Indian
s
shoulder
The
big
Indian
walking
along
beside
them
The
cold
night
The
shuttered
houses
of
the
town
The
little
Indian
who
has
lost
his
artificial
arm
The
big
Indian
who
was
also
in
the
war
Yogi
Johnson
who
was
in
the
war
too
The
three
of
them
walking
walking
walking
Where
were
they
going
Where
could
they
go
What
was
there
left
Suddenly
under
a
street
light
that
swung
on
its
drooping
wire
above
a
street
corner
casting
its
light
down
on
the
snow
the
big
Indian
stopped
Walking
no
get
us
nowhere
he
grunted
Walking
no
good
Let
white
chief
speak
Where
we
go
white
chief
Yogi
Johnson
did
not
know
Obviously
walking
was
not
the
solution
of
their
problem
Walking
was
all
right
in
its
way
Coxey
s
Army
A
horde
of
men
seeking
work
pressing
on
toward
Washington
Marching
men
Yogi
thought
Marching
on
and
on
and
where
were
they
getting
Nowhere
Yogi
knew
it
only
too
well
Nowhere
No
damn
where
at
all
White
chief
speak
up
the
big
Indian
said
I
don
t
know
Yogi
said
I
don
t
know
at
all
Was
this
what
they
had
fought
the
war
for
Was
this
what
it
was
all
about
It
looked
like
it
Yogi
standing
under
the
street
light
Yogi
thinking
and
wondering
The
two
Indians
in
their
mackinaw
coats
One
of
the
Indians
with
an
empty
sleeve
All
of
them
wondering
White
chief
no
speak
the
big
Indian
asked
No
What
could
Yogi
say
What
was
there
to
say
Red
brother
speak
asked
the
Indian
Speak
out
Yogi
said
He
looked
down
at
the
snow
One
man
s
as
good
as
another
now
White
chief
ever
go
to
Brown
s
Beanery
asked
the
big
Indian
looking
into
Yogi
s
face
under
the
arc
light
No
Yogi
felt
all
in
Was
this
the
end
A
beanery
Well
a
beanery
as
well
as
any
other
place
But
a
beanery
Well
why
not
These
Indians
knew
the
town
They
were
ex-service
men
They
both
had
splendid
war
records
He
knew
that
himself
But
a
beanery
White
chief
come
with
red
brothers
The
tall
Indian
put
his
arm
under
Yogi
s
arm
The
little
Indian
fell
into
step
Forward
to
the
beanery
Yogi
spoke
quietly
He
was
a
white
man
but
he
knew
when
he
had
enough
After
all
the
white
race
might
not
always
be
supreme
This
Moslem
revolt
Unrest
in
the
East
Trouble
in
the
West
Things
looked
black
in
the
South
Now
this
condition
of
things
in
the
North
Where
was
it
taking
him
Where
did
it
all
lead
Would
it
help
him
to
want
a
woman
Would
spring
ever
come
Was
it
worth
while
after
all
He
wondered
The
three
of
them
striding
along
the
frozen
streets
of
Petoskey
Going
somewhere
now
En
route
Huysmans
wrote
that
It
would
be
interesting
to
read
French
He
must
try
it
sometime
There
was
a
street
in
Paris
named
after
Huysmans
Right
around
the
corner
from
where
Gertrude
Stein
lived
Ah
there
was
a
woman
Where
were
her
experiments
in
words
leading
her
What
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
All
that
in
Paris
Ah
Paris
How
far
it
was
to
Paris
now
Paris
in
the
morning
Paris
in
the
evening
Paris
at
night
Paris
in
the
morning
again
Paris
at
noon
perhaps
Why
not
Yogi
Johnson
striding
on
His
mind
never
still
All
three
of
them
striding
on
together
The
arms
of
those
that
had
arms
linked
through
each
other
s
arms
Red
men
and
white
men
walking
together
Something
had
brought
them
together
Was
it
the
war
Was
it
fate
Was
it
accident
Or
was
it
just
chance
These
questions
struggled
with
each
other
in
Yogi
Johnson
s
brain
His
brain
was
tired
He
had
been
thinking
too
much
lately
On
still
they
strode
Then
abruptly
they
stopped
The
little
Indian
looked
up
at
the
sign
It
shone
in
the
night
outside
the
frosted
windows
of
the
beanery

Take

The

uncertainly
outside
the
door
The

Indian
turned
to
Yogi
White

Yes
I

Yogi
answered
He

After
all
perhaps
it
was
true
It
was
a
chance
he
was
taking
He
had
taken
a
chance
in
Paris
once
Steve
Brodie
had
taken
a
chance
Or
so
they
said
Chances
were
taken
all
over
the

In

Chinamen

In

In

In

the
tall
Indian
grunted
quietly
He
had
voiced
Yogi
s
unspoken
doubt
They
were
a
canny
folk
these
red
men
Not
even
in
the
rug
game
Red
brother
think
not
the
Indian
said
His
tones
carried
conviction
to
Yogi
Who
were
these
Indians
There
was
something
back
of
all
this
They
went
into
the
beanery
Author
s
Note
to
Reader
It
was
at
this
point
in
the
story
reader
that
Mr
F
Scott
Fitzgerald
came
to
our
home
one
afternoon
and
after
remaining
for
quite
a
while
suddenly
sat
down
in
the
fireplace
and
would
not
or
was
it
could
not
reader
get
up
and
let
the
fire
burn
something
else
so
as
to
keep
the
room
warm
I
know
reader
that
these
things
sometimes
do
not
show
in
a
story
but
just
the
same
they
are
happening
and
think
what
they
mean
to
chaps
like
you
and
me
in
the
literary
game
If
you
should
think
this
part
of
the
story
is
not
as
good
as
it
might
have
been
remember
reader
that
day
in
and
day
out
all
over
the
world
things
like
this
are
happening
Need
I
add
reader
that
I
have
the
utmost
respect
for
Mr
Fitzgerald
and
let
anybody
else
attack
him
and
I
would
be
the
first
to
spring
to
his
defense
And
that
includes
you
too
reader
though
I
hate
to
speak
out
bluntly
like
this
and
take
the
risk
of
breaking
up
a
friendship
of
the
sort
that
ours
has
gotten
to
be
P
S
To
the
Reader
As
I
read
that
chapter
over
reader
it
doesn
t
seem
so
bad
You
may
like
it
I
hope
you
will
And
if
you
do
like
it
reader
and
the
rest
of
the
book
as
well
will
you
tell
your
friends
about
it
and
try
and
get
them
to
buy
the
book
just
as
you
have
done
I
only
get
twenty
cents
on
each
book
that
is
sold
and
while
twenty
cents
is
not
much
nowadays
still
it
will
mount
up
to
a
lot
if
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
copies
of
the
book
are
sold
They
will
be
too
if
every
one
likes
the
book
as
much
as
you
and
I
do
reader
And
listen
reader
I
meant
it
when
I
said
I
would
be
glad
to
read
anything
you
wrote
That
wasn
t
just
talk
Bring
it
along
and
we
will
go
over
it
together
If
you
like
I
ll
re-write
bits
of
it
for
you
I
don
t
mean
that
in
any
critical
sort
of
way
either
If
there
is
anything
you
do
not
like
in
this
book
just
write
to
Mr
Scribner
s
Sons
at
the
home
office
They
ll
change
it
for
you
Or
if
you
would
rather
I
will
change
it
myself
You
know
what
I
think
of
you
reader
And
you
re
not
angry
or
upset
about
what
I
said
about
Scott
Fitzgerald
either
are
you
I
hope
not
Now
I
am
going
to
write
the
next
chapter
Mr
Fitzgerald
is
gone
and
Mr
Dos
Passos
had
gone
to
England
and
I
think
I
can
promise
you
that
it
will
be
a
bully
chapter
At
least
it
will
be
just
as
good
as
I
can
write
it
We
both
know
how
good
that
can
be
if
we
read
the
blurbs
eh
reader
Inside
the
beanery
They
are
all
inside
the
beanery
Some
do
not
see
the
others
Each
are
intent
on
themselves
Red
men
are
intent
on
red
men
White
men
are
intent
on
white
men
or
on
white
women
There
are
no
red
women
Are
there
no
squaws
any
more
What
has
become
of
the
squaws
Have
we
lost
our
squaws
in
America
Silently
through
the
door
which
she
had
opened
a
squaw
came
into
the
room
She
was
clad
only
in
a
pair
of
worn
moccasins
On
her
back
was
a
papoose
Beside
her
walked
a
husky
dog
Don
t
look
the
drummer
shouted
to
the
women
at
the
counter
Here
Get
her
out
of
here
the
owner
of
the
beanery
shouted
The
squaw
was
forcibly
ejected
by
the
Negro
cook
They
heard
her
thrashing
around
in
the
snow
outside
Her
husky
dog
was
barking
My
God
What
that
might
have
led
to
Scripps
O
Neil
mopped
his
forehead
with
a
napkin
The
Indians
had
watched
with
impassive
faces
Yogi
Johnson
had
been
unable
to
move
The
waitresses
had
covered
their
faces
with
napkins
or
whatever
was
handy
Mrs
Scripps
had
covered
her
eyes
with
The
American
Mercury
Scripps
O
Neil
was
feeling
faint
and
shaken
Something
had
stirred
inside
him
some
vague
primordial
feeling
as
the
squaw
had
come
into
the
room
Wonder
where
that
squaw
came
from
the
drummer
asked
Her
my
squaw
the
little
Indian
said
Good
God
man
Can
t
you
clothe
her
Scripps
O
Neil
said
in
a
dumb
voice
There
was
a
note
of
terror
in
his
words
Her
no
like
clothes
the
little
Indian
explained
Her
woods
Indian
Yogi
Johnson
was
not
listening
Something
had
broken
inside
of
him
Something
had
snapped
as
the
squaw
came
into
the
room
He
had
a
new
feeling
A
feeling
he
thought
had
been
lost
for
ever
Lost
for
always
Lost
Gone
permanently
He
knew
now
it
was
a
mistake
He
was
all
right
now
By
the
merest
chance
he
had
found
it
out
What
might
he
not
have
thought
if
that
squaw
had
never
come
into
the
beanery
What
black
thoughts
he
had
been
thinking
He
had
been
on
the
verge
of
suicide
Self-destruction
Killing
himself
Here
in
this
beanery
What
a
mistake
that
would
have
been
He
knew
now
What
a
botch
he
might
have
made
of
life
Killing
himself
Let
spring
come
now
Let
it
come
It
couldn
t
come
fast
enough
Let
spring
come
He
was
ready
for
it
Listen
he
said
to
the
two
Indians
I
want
to
tell
you
about
something
that
happened
to
me
in
Paris
The
two
Indians
leaned
forward
White
chief
got
the
floor
the
tall
Indian
remarked
What
I
thought
was
a
very
beautiful
thing
happened
to
me
in
Paris
Yogi
began
You
Indians
know
Paris
Good
Well
it
turned
out
to
be
the
ugliest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
The
Indians
grunted
They
knew
their
Paris
It
was
the
first
day
of
my
leave
I
was
walking
along
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
A
car
passed
me
and
a
beautiful
woman
leaned
out
She
called
to
me
and
I
came
She
took
me
to
a
house
a
mansion
rather
in
a
distant
part
of
Paris
and
there
a
very
beautiful
thing
happened
to
me
Afterward
someone
took
me
out
a
different
door
than
I
had
come
in
by
The
beautiful
woman
had
told
me
that
she
would
never
that
she
could
never
see
me
again
I
tried
to
get
the
number
of
the
mansion
but
it
was
one
of
a
block
of
mansions
all
looking
the
same
From
then
on
all
through
my
leave
I
tried
to
see
that
beautiful
lady
Once
I
thought
I
saw
her
in
the
theatre
It
wasn
t
her
Another
time
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
what
I
thought
was
her
in
a
passing
taxi
and
leaped
into
another
taxi
and
followed
I
lost
the
taxi
I
was
desperate
Finally
on
the
next
to
the
last
night
of
my
leave
I
was
so
desperate
and
dull
that
I
went
with
one
of
those
guides
that
guarantee
to
show
you
all
of
Paris
We
started
out
and
visited
various
places
Is
this
all
you
ve
got
I
asked
the
guide
There
is
a
real
place
but
it
s
very
expensive
the
guide
said
We
compromised
on
a
price
finally
and
the
guide
took
me
It
was
in
an
old
mansion
You
looked
through
a
slit
in
the
wall
All
around
the
wall
were
people
looking
through
slits
There
looking
through
slits
could
be
seen
the
uniforms
of
men
of
all
the
Allied
countries
and
many
handsome
South
Americans
in
evening
dress
I
looked
through
a
slit
myself
For
a
while
nothing
happened
Then
a
beautiful
woman
came
into
the
room
with
a
young
British
officer
She
took
off
her
long
fur
coat
and
her
hat
and
threw
them
into
a
chair
The
officer
was
taking
off
his
Sam
Browne
belt
I
recognized
her
It
was
the
lady
whom
I
had
been
with
when
the
beautiful
thing
happened
to
me
Yogi
Johnson
looked
at
his
empty
plate
of
beans
Since
then
he
said
I
have
never
wanted
a
woman
How
I
have
suffered
I
can
not
tell
But
I
ve
suffered
boys
I
ve
suffered
I
blamed
it
on
the
war
I
blamed
it
on
France
I
blamed
it
on
the
decay
of
morality
in
general
I
blamed
it
on
the
younger
generation
I
blamed
it
here
I
blamed
it
there
Now
I
am
cured
Here
s
five
dollars
for
you
boys
His
eyes
were
shining
Get
some
more
to
eat
Take
a
trip
somewhere
This
is
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
He
stood
up
from
his
stool
before
the
counter
shook
the
one
Indian
impulsively
by
the
hand
rested
his
hand
for
a
minute
on
the
other
Indian
s
shoulder
opened
the
door
of
the
beanery
and
strode
out
into
the
night
The
two
Indians
looked
at
one
another
White
chief
heap
nice
fella
observed
the
big
Indian
Think
him
was
in
the
war
asked
the
little
Indian
Me
wonder
the
big
Indian
said
White
chief
said
he
buy
me
new
artificial
arm
the
little
Indian
grumbled
Maybe
you
get
more
than
that
the
big
Indian
said
Me
wonder
the
little
Indian
said
They
went
on
eating
At
the
other
end
of
the
counter
of
the
beanery
a
marriage
was
coming
to
an
end
Scripps
O
Neil
and
his
wife
sat
side
by
side
Mrs
Scripps
knew
now
She
couldn
t
hold
him
She
had
tried
and
failed
She
had
lost
She
knew
it
was
a
losing
game
There
was
no
holding
him
now
Mandy
was
talking
again
Talking
Talking
Always
talking
That
interminable
stream
of
literary
gossip
that
was
bringing
her
Diana
s
marriage
to
an
end
She
couldn
t
hold
him
He
was
going
Going
Going
away
from
her
Diana
sitting
there
in
misery
Scripps
listening
to
Mandy
talking
Mandy
talking
Talking
Talking
The
drummer
an
old
friend
now
the
drummer
sitting
reading
his
Detroit
News
She
couldn
t
hold
him
She
couldn
t
hold
him
She
couldn
t
hold
him
The
little
Indian
got
up
from
his
stool
at
the
beanery
counter
and
went
over
to
the
window
The
glass
on
the
window
was
covered
with
thick
rimy
frost
The
little
Indian
breathed
on
the
frozen
windowpane
rubbed
the
spot
bare
with
the
empty
sleeve
of
his
mackinaw
coat
and
looked
out
into
the
night
Suddenly
he
turned
from
the
window
and
rushed
out
into
the
night
The
tall
Indian
watched
him
go
leisurely
finished
his
meal
took
a
toothpick
placed
it
between
his
teeth
and
then
he
too
followed
his
friend
out
into
the
night
They
were
alone
in
the
beanery
now
Scripps
and
Mandy
and
Diana
Only
the
drummer
was
with
them
He
was
an
old
friend
now
But
his
nerves
were
on
edge
tonight
He
folded
his
paper
abruptly
and
started
for
the
door
See
you
all
later
he
said
He
went
out
into
the
night
It
seemed
the
only
thing
to
do
He
did
it
Only
three
of
them
in
the
beanery
now
Scripps
and
Mandy
and
Diana
Only
those
three
Mandy
was
talking
Leaning
on
the
counter
and
talking
Scripps
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
Mandy
Diana
made
no
pretense
of
listening
now
She
knew
it
was
over
It
was
all
over
now
But
she
would
make
one
more
attempt
One
more
last
gallant
try
Perhaps
she
still
could
hold
him
Perhaps
it
had
all
been
just
a
dream
She
steadied
her
voice
and
then
she
spoke
Scripps
dear
she
said
Her
voice
shook
a
little
She
steadied
it
What
s
on
your
mind
Scripps
asked
abruptly
Ah
there
it
was
That
horrid
clipped
speech
again
Scripps
dear
wouldn
t
you
like
to
come
home
Diana
s
voice
quavered
There
s
a
new
Mercury
She
had
changed
from
the
London
Mercury
to
The
American
Mercury
just
to
please
Scripps
It
just
came
I
wish
you
felt
like
coming
home
normale
s
a
splendid
thing
in
this
Mercury
Do
come
home
Scripps
I
ve
never
asked
anything
of
you
before
Come
home
Scripps
Oh
won
t
you
come
home
Scripps
looked
up
Diana
s
heart
beat
faster
Perhaps
he
was
coming
Perhaps
she
was
holding
him
Holding
him
Holding
him
Do
come
Scripps
dear
Diana
said
softly
There
s
a
wonderful
editorial
in
it
by
Mencken
about
chiropractors
Scripps
looked
away
Won
t
you
come
Scripps
Diana
pleaded
No
Scripps
said
I
don
t
give
a
damn
about
Mencken
any
more
Diana
dropped
her
head
Oh
Scripps
she
said
Oh
Scripps
This
was
the
end
She
had
her
answer
now
She
had
lost
him
Lost
him
Lost
him
It
was
over
Finished
Done
for
She
sat
crying
silently
Mandy
was
talking
again
Suddenly
Diana
straightened
up
She
had
one
last
request
to
make
One
thing
she
would
ask
him
Only
one
He
might
refuse
her
He
might
not
grant
it
But
she
would
ask
him
Scripps
she
said
What
s
the
trouble
Scripps
turned
in
irritation
Perhaps
after
all
he
was
sorry
for
her
He
wondered
Can
I
take
the
bird
Scripps
Diana
s
voice
broke
Sure
said
Scripps
Why
not
Diana
picked
up
the
bird-cage
The
bird
was
asleep
Perched
on
one
leg
as
on
that
night
when
they
had
first
met
What
was
it
he
was
like
Ah
yes
Like
an
old
osprey
An
old
old
osprey
from
her
own
Lake
Country
She
held
the
cage
to
her
tightly
Thank
you
Scripps
she
said
Thank
you
for
this
bird
Her
voice
broke
And
now
I
must
be
going
Quietly
silently
gathering
her
shawl
around
her
clutching
the
cage
with
the
sleeping
bird
and
the
copy
of
The
Mercury
to
her
breast
with
only
a
backward
glance
a
last
glance
at
him
who
had
been
her
Scripps
she
opened
the
door
of
the
beanery
and
went
out
into
the
night
Scripps
did
not
even
see
her
go
He
was
intent
on
what
Mandy
was
saying
Mandy
was
talking
again
That
bird
she
just
took
out
Mandy
was
saying
Oh
did
she
take
a
bird
out
Scripps
asked
Go
on
with
the
story
You
used
to
wonder
about
what
sort
of
bird
that
was
Mandy
went
on
That
s
right
Scripps
agreed
Well
that
reminds
me
of
a
story
about
Gosse
and
the
Marquis
of
Buque
Mandy
went
on
Tell
it
Mandy
Tell
it
Scripps
urged
It
seems
a
great
friend
of
mine
Ford
you
ve
heard
me
speak
of
him
before
was
in
the
marquis
s
castle
during
the
war
His
regiment
was
billeted
there
and
the
marquis
one
of
the
richest
if
not
the
richest
man
in
England
was
serving
in
Ford
s
regiment
as
a
private
Ford
was
sitting
in
the
library
one
evening
The
library
was
a
most
extraordinary
place
The
walls
were
made
of
bricks
of
gold
set
into
tiles
or
something
I
forget
exactly
how
it
was
Go
on
Scripps
urged
It
doesn
t
matter
Anyhow
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
of
the
library
was
a
stuffed
flamingo
in
a
glass
case
They
understand
interior
decorating
these
English
Scripps
said
Your
wife
was
English
wasn
t
she
asked
Mandy
From
the
Lake
Country
Scripps
answered
Go
on
with
the
story
Well
anyway
Mandy
went
on
Ford
was
sitting
there
in
the
library
one
evening
after
mess
when
the
butler
came
in
and
said
The
Marquis
of
Buque
s
compliments
and
might
he
show
the
library
to
a
group
of
friends
with
whom
he
has
been
dining
They
used
to
let
him
dine
out
and
sometimes
they
let
him
sleep
in
the
castle
Ford
said
Quite
and
in
came
the
marquis
in
his
private
s
uniform
followed
by
Sir
Edmund
Gosse
and
Professor
Whatsisname
I
forget
it
for
the
moment
from
Oxford
Gosse
stopped
in
front
of
the
stuffed
flamingo
in
the
glass
case
and
said
What
have
we
here
Buque
It
s
a
flamingo
Sir
Edmund
the
marquis
answered
That
s
not
my
idea
of
a
flamingo
Gosse
remarked
No
Gosse
That
s
God
s
idea
of
a
flamingo
Professor
Whatsisname
said
I
wish
I
could
remember
his
name
Don
t
bother
Scripps
said
His
eyes
were
bright
He
leaned
forward
Something
was
pounding
inside
of
him
Something
he
could
not
control
I
love
you
Mandy
he
said
I
love
you
You
are
my
woman
The
thing
was
pounding
away
inside
of
him
It
would
not
stop
That
s
all
right
Mandy
answered
I
ve
known
you
were
my
man
for
a
long
time
Would
you
like
to
hear
another
story
Speaking
of
woman
Go
on
Scripps
said
You
must
never
stop
Mandy
You
are
my
woman
now
Sure
Mandy
agreed
This
story
is
about
when
Knut
Hamsun
was
a
streetcar
conductor
in
Chicago
Go
on
Scripps
said
You
are
my
woman
now
Mandy
He
repeated
the
phrase
to
himself
My
woman
My
woman
You
are
my
woman
She
is
my
woman
It
is
my
woman
My
woman
But
somehow
he
was
not
satisfied
Somewhere
somehow
there
must
be
something
else
Something
else
My
woman
The
words
were
a
little
hollow
now
Into
his
mind
though
he
tried
to
thrust
it
out
there
came
again
the
monstrous
picture
of
the
squaw
as
she
strode
silently
into
the
room
That
squaw
She
did
not
wear
clothes
because
she
did
not
like
them
Hardy
braving
the
winter
nights
What
might
not
the
spring
bring
Mandy
was
talking
Mandy
talking
on
in
the
beanery
Mandy
telling
her
stories
It
grows
late
in
the
beanery
Mandy
talks
on
She
is
his
woman
now
He
is
her
man
But
is
he
her
man
In
Scripps
s
brain
that
vision
of
the
squaw
The
squaw
that
strode
unannounced
into
the
beanery
The
squaw
who
had
been
thrown
out
into
the
snow
Mandy
talking
on
Telling
literary
reminiscences
Authentic
incidents
They
had
the
ring
of
truth
But
were
they
enough
Scripps
wondered
She
was
his
woman
But
for
how
long
Scripps
wondered
Mandy
talking
on
in
the
beanery
Scripps
listening
But
his
mind
straying
away
Straying
away
Straying
away
Where
was
it
straying
Out
into
the
night
Out
into
the
night
Night
in
Petoskey
Long
past
midnight
Inside
the
beanery
a
light
burning
The
town
asleep
under
the
Northern
moon
To
the
North
the
tracks
of
the
G
R
I
Railroad
running
far
into
the
North
Cold
tracks
stretching
North
toward
Mackinaw
City
and
St
Ignace
Cold
tracks
to
be
walking
on
at
this
time
of
night
North
of
the
frozen
little
Northern
town
a
couple
walking
side
by
side
on
the
tracks
It
is
Yogi
Johnson
walking
with
the
squaw
As
they
walk
Yogi
Johnson
silently
strips
off
his
garments
One
by
one
he
strips
off
his
garments
and
casts
them
beside
the
track
In
the
end
he
is
clad
only
in
a
worn
pair
of
pump-maker
shoes
Yogi
Johnson
naked
in
the
moonlight
walking
North
beside
the
squaw
The
squaw
striding
along
beside
him
She
carries
the
papoose
on
her
back
in
his
bark
cradle
Yogi
attempts
to
take
the
papoose
from
her
He
would
carry
the
papoose
The
husky
dog
whines
and
licks
at
Yogi
Johnson
s
ankles
No
the
squaw
would
carry
the
papoose
herself
On
they
stride
Into
the
North
Into
the
Northern
night
Behind
them
come
two
figures
Sharply
etched
in
the
moonlight
It
is
the
two
Indians
The
two
woods
Indians
They
stoop
and
gather
up
the
garments
Yogi
Johnson
has
cast
away
Occasionally
they
grunt
to
one
another
Striding
softly
along
in
the
moonlight
Their
keen
eyes
not
missing
a
single
cast-off
garment
When
the
last
garment
has
been
cast
off
they
look
and
see
far
ahead
of
them
the
two
figures
in
the
moonlight
The
two
Indians
straighten
up
They
examine
the
garments
White
chief
snappy
dresser
the
tall
Indian
remarks
holding
up
an
initialled
shirt
White
chief
going
get
pretty
cold
the
small
Indian
remarks
He
hands
a
vest
to
the
tall
Indian
The
tall
Indian
rolls
all
the
clothing
all
the
cast-off
garments
into
a
bundle
and
they
start
back
along
the
tracks
to
the
town
Better
keep
clothes
for
white
chief
or
sellem
Salvation
Army
asks
the
short
Indian
Better
sellem
Salvation
Army
the
tall
Indian
grunts
White
chief
maybe
never
come
back
White
chief
come
back
all
right
grunted
the
little
Indian
Better
sellem
Salvation
Army
anyway
grunts
the
tall
Indian
White
chief
need
new
clothes
anyhow
when
spring
comes
As
they
walked
down
the
tracks
toward
town
the
air
seemed
to
soften
The
Indians
walk
uneasily
now
Through
the
tamaracks
and
cedars
beside
the
railway
tracks
a
warm
wind
is
blowing
The
snow-drifts
are
melting
now
beside
the
tracks
Something
stirs
inside
the
two
Indians
Some
urge
Some
strange
pagan
disturbance
The
warm
wind
is
blowing
The
tall
Indian
stops
moistens
his
finger
and
holds
it
up
in
the
air
The
little
Indian
watches
Chinook
he
asks
Heap
chinook
the
tall
Indian
says
They
hurry
on
toward
town
The
moon
is
blurred
now
by
clouds
carried
by
the
warm
chinook
wind
that
is
blowing
Want
to
get
in
town
before
rush
the
tall
Indian
grunts
Red
brothers
want
be
well
up
in
line
the
little
Indian
grunts
anxiously
Nobody
work
in
factory
now
the
tall
Indian
grunted
Better
hurry
The
warm
wind
blows
Inside
the
Indians
strange
longings
were
stirring
They
knew
what
they
wanted
Spring
at
last
wascoming
to
the
frozen
little
Northern
town
The
two
Indians
hurried
along
the
track
