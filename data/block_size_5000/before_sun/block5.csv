for
himself
We
will
now
leave
the
couple
on
their
way
to
the
beanery
and
go
back
and
take
up
Yogi
Johnson
We
want
the
reader
to
like
Yogi
Johnson
The
story
will
move
a
little
faster
from
now
on
in
case
any
of
the
readers
are
tiring
We
will
also
try
and
work
in
a
number
of
good
anecdotes
Would
it
be
any
violation
of
confidence
if
we
told
the
reader
that
we
get
the
best
of
these
anecdotes
from
Mr
Ford
Madox
Ford
We
owe
him
our
thanks
and
we
hope
the
reader
does
too
At
any
rate
we
will
now
go
on
with
Yogi
Johnson
Yogi
Johnson
the
reader
may
remember
is
the
chap
who
was
in
the
war
As
the
story
opens
he
is
just
coming
out
of
the
pump-factory
See
page
three
It
is
very
hard
to
write
this
way
beginning
things
backward
and
the
author
hopes
the
reader
will
realize
this
and
not
grudge
this
little
word
of
explanation
I
know
I
would
be
very
glad
to
read
anything
the
reader
ever
wrote
and
I
hope
the
reader
will
make
the
same
sort
of
allowances
If
any
of
the
readers
would
care
to
send
me
anything
they
ever
wrote
for
criticism
or
advice
I
am
always
at
the
Caf
du
D
me
any
afternoon
talking
about
Art
with
Harold
Stearns
and
Sinclair
Lewis
and
the
reader
can
bring
his
stuff
along
with
him
or
he
can
send
it
to
me
care
of
my
bank
if
I
have
a
bank
Now
if
the
reader
is
ready
and
understand
I
don
t
want
to
rush
the
reader
any
we
will
go
back
to
Yogi
Johnson
But
please
remember
that
while
we
have
gone
back
to
Yogi
Johnson
Scripps
O
Neil
and
his
wife
are
on
their
way
to
the
beanery
What
will
happen
to
them
there
I
don
t
know
I
only
wish
the
reader
could
help
me
Part
Three
Men
in
War
and
the
Death
of
Society
It
may
be
likewise
noted
that
affectation
does
not
imply
an
absolute
negation
of
those
qualities
which
are
affected
and
therefore
though
when
it
proceeds
from
hypocrisy
it
be
nearly
allied
to
deceit
yet
when
it
comes
from
vanity
only
it
partakes
of
the
nature
of
ostentation
for
instance
the
affectation
of
liberality
in
a
vain
man
differs
visibly
from
the
same
affectation
in
the
avaricious
for
though
the
vain
man
is
not
what
he
would
appear
or
hath
not
the
virtue
he
affects
to
the
degree
he
would
be
thought
to
have
it
yet
it
sits
less
awkwardly
on
him
than
on
the
avaricious
man
who
is
the
very
reverse
of
what
he
would
seem
to
be
HENRY
FIELDING
Yogi
Johnson
walked
out
of
the
workmen
s
entrance
of
the
pump-factory
and
down
the
street
Spring
was
in
the
air
The
snow
was
melting
and
the
gutters
were
running
with
snow-water
Yogi
Johnson
walked
down
the
middle
of
the
street
keeping
on
the
as
yet
unmelted
ice
He
turned
to
the
left
and
crossed
the
bridge
over
Bear
River
The
ice
had
already
melted
in
the
river
and
he
watched
the
swirling
brown
current
Below
beside
the
stream
buds
on
the
willow
brush
were
coming
out
green
It
s
a
real
chinook
wind
Yogi
thought
The
foreman
did
right
to
let
the
men
go
It
wouldn
t
be
safe
keeping
them
in
a
day
like
this
Anything
might
happen
The
owner
of
the
factory
knew
a
thing
or
two
When
the
chinook
blew
the
thing
to
do
was
to
get
the
men
out
of
the
factory
Then
if
any
of
them
were
injured
it
was
not
on
him
He
didn
t
get
caught
under
the
Employer
s
Liability
Act
They
knew
a
thing
or
two
these
big
pump-manufacturers
They
were
smart
all
right
Yogi
was
worried
There
was
something
on
his
mind
It
was
spring
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
now
and
he
did
not
want
a
woman
He
had
worried
about
it
a
lot
lately
There
was
no
question
about
it
He
did
not
want
a
woman
He
couldn
t
explain
it
to
himself
He
had
gone
to
the
Public
Library
and
asked
for
a
book
the
night
before
He
looked
at
the
librarian
He
did
not
want
her
Somehow
she
meant
nothing
to
him
At
the
restaurant
where
he
had
a
meal
ticket
he
looked
hard
at
the
waitress
who
brought
him
his
meals
He
did
not
want
her
either
He
passed
a
group
of
girls
on
their
way
home
from
high
school
He
looked
carefully
at
all
of
them
He
did
not
want
a
single
one
Decidedly
something
was
wrong
Was
he
going
to
pieces
Was
this
the
end
Well
Yogi
thought
women
are
gone
perhaps
though
I
hope
not
but
I
still
have
my
love
of
horses
He
was
walking
up
the
steep
hill
that
leads
up
from
the
Bear
River
out
onto
the
Charlevoix
road
The
road
was
not
really
so
steep
but
it
felt
steep
to
Yogi
his
legs
heavy
with
the
spring
In
front
of
him
was
a
grain
and
feed
store
A
team
of
beautiful
horses
were
hitched
in
front
of
the
feed
store
Yogi
went
up
to
them
He
wanted
to
touch
them
To
reassure
himself
that
there
was
something
left
The
nigh
horse
looked
at
him
as
he
came
near
Yogi
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
for
a
lump
of
sugar
He
had
no
sugar
The
horse
put
its
ears
back
and
showed
its
teeth
The
other
horse
jerked
its
head
away
Was
this
all
that
his
love
of
horses
had
brought
him
After
all
perhaps
there
was
something
wrong
with
these
horses
Perhaps
they
had
glanders
or
spavin
Perhaps
something
had
been
caught
in
the
tender
frog
of
their
hoof
Perhaps
they
were
lovers
Yogi
walked
on
up
the
hill
and
turned
to
the
left
onto
the
Charlevoix
road
He
passed
the
last
houses
of
the
outskirts
of
Petoskey
and
came
out
onto
the
open
country
road
On
his
right
was
a
field
that
stretched
to
Little
Traverse
Bay
The
blue
of
the
bay
opening
out
into
the
big
Lake
Michigan
Across
the
bay
the
pine
hills
behind
Harbor
Springs
Beyond
where
you
could
not
see
it
Cross
Village
where
the
Indians
lived
Even
further
beyond
the
Straits
of
Mackinac
with
St
Ignace
where
a
strange
and
beautiful
thing
had
once
happened
to
Oscar
Gardner
who
worked
beside
Yogi
in
the
pump-factory
Further
beyond
the
Soo
both
Canadian
and
American
There
the
wilder
spirits
of
Petoskey
sometimes
went
to
drink
beer
They
were
happy
then
Way
way
beyond
and
in
the
other
direction
at
the
foot
of
the
lake
was
Chicago
where
Scripps
O
Neil
had
started
for
on
that
eventful
night
when
his
first
marriage
had
become
a
marriage
no
longer
Near
there
Gary
Indiana
where
were
the
great
steel
mills
Near
there
Hammond
Indiana
Near
there
Michigan
City
Indiana
Further
beyond
there
would
be
Indianapolis
Indiana
where
Booth
Tarkington
lived
He
had
the
wrong
dope
that
fellow
Further
down
there
would
be
Cincinnati
Ohio
Beyond
that
Vicksburg
Mississippi
Beyond
that
Waco
Texas
Ah
there
was
grand
sweep
to
this
America
of
ours
Yogi
walked
across
the
road
and
sat
down
on
a
pile
of
logs
where
he
could
look
out
over
the
lake
After
all
the
war
was
over
and
he
was
still
alive
There
was
a
chap
in
that
fellow
Anderson
s
book
that
the
librarian
had
given
him
at
the
library
last
night
Why
hadn
t
he
wanted
the
librarian
anyway
Could
it
be
because
he
thought
she
might
have
false
teeth
Could
it
be
something
else
Would
a
little
child
ever
tell
her
He
didn
t
know
What
was
the
librarian
to
him
anyway
This
chap
in
the
book
by
Anderson
He
had
been
a
soldier
too
He
had
been
at
the
front
two
years
Anderson
said
What
was
his
name
Fred
Something
This
Fred
had
thoughts
dancing
in
his
brain
horror
One
night
in
the
time
of
the
fighting
he
went
out
on
parade
no
it
was
patrol
in
No
Man
s
Land
and
saw
another
man
stumbling
along
in
the
darkness
and
shot
him
The
man
pitched
forward
dead
It
had
been
the
only
time
Fred
consciously
killed
a
man
You
don
t
kill
men
in
war
much
the
book
said
The
hell
you
don
t
Yogi
thought
if
you
re
two
years
in
the
infantry
at
the
front
They
just
die
Indeed
they
do
Yogi
thought
Anderson
said
the
act
was
rather
hysterical
on
Fred
s
part
He
and
the
men
with
him
might
have
made
the
fellow
surrender
They
had
all
got
the
jimjams
After
it
happened
they
all
ran
away
together
Where
the
hell
did
they
run
to
Yogi
wondered
Paris
Afterward
killing
this
man
haunted
Fred
It
s
got
to
be
sweet
and
true
That
was
the
way
the
soldiers
thought
Anderson
said
The
hell
it
was
This
Fred
was
supposed
to
have
been
two
years
in
an
infantry
regiment
at
the
front
A
couple
of
Indians
were
passing
along
the
road
grunting
to
themselves
and
to
each
other
Yogi
called
to
them
The
Indians
came
over
Big
white
chief
got
chew
of
tobacco
asked
the
first
Indian
White
chief
carry
liquor
the
second
Indian
asked
Yogi
handed
them
a
package
of
Peerless
and
his
pocket
flask
White
chief
heap
big
medicine
the
Indians
grunted
Listen
Yogi
Johnson
said
I
am
about
to
address
to
you
a
few
remarks
about
the
war
A
subject
on
which
I
feel
very
deeply
The
Indians
sat
down
on
the
logs
One
of
the
Indians
pointed
at
the
sky
Up
there
gitchy
Manitou
the
Mighty
he
said
The
other
Indian
winked
at
Yogi
White
chief
no
believe
every
goddam
thing
he
hear
he
grunted
Listen
Yogi
Johnson
said
And
he
told
them
about
the
war
War
hadn
t
been
that
way
to
Yogi
he
told
the
Indians
War
had
been
to
him
like
football
American
football
What
they
play
at
the
colleges
Carlisle
Indian
School
Both
the
Indians
nodded
They
had
been
to
Carlisle
Yogi
had
played
centre
at
football
and
war
had
been
much
the
same
thing
intensely
unpleasant
When
you
played
football
and
had
the
ball
you
were
down
with
your
legs
spread
out
and
the
ball
held
out
in
front
of
you
on
the
ground
you
had
to
listen
for
the
signal
decode
it
and
make
the
proper
pass
You
had
to
think
about
it
all
the
time
While
your
hands
were
on
the
ball
the
opposing
centre
stood
in
front
of
you
and
when
you
passed
the
ball
he
brought
his
hand
up
smash
into
your
face
and
grabbed
you
with
the
other
hand
under
the
chin
or
under
your
armpit
and
tried
to
pull
you
forward
or
shove
you
back
to
make
a
hole
he
could
go
through
and
break
up
the
play
You
were
supposed
to
charge
forward
so
hard
you
banged
him
out
of
the
play
with
your
body
and
put
you
both
on
the
ground
He
had
all
the
advantage
It
was
not
what
you
would
call
fun
When
you
had
the
ball
he
had
all
the
advantage
The
only
good
thing
was
that
when
he
had
the
ball
you
could
rough-house
him
In
this
way
things
evened
up
and
sometimes
even
a
certain
tolerance
was
achieved
Football
like
the
war
was
unpleasant
stimulating
and
exciting
after
you
had
attained
a
certain
hardness
and
the
chief
difficulty
had
been
that
of
remembering
the
signals
Yogi
was
thinking
about
the
war
not
the
army
He
meant
combat
The
army
was
something
different
You
could
take
it
and
ride
with
it
or
you
could
buck
the
tiger
and
let
it
smash
you
The
army
was
a
silly
business
but
the
war
was
different
Yogi
was
not
haunted
by
men
he
had
killed
He
knew
he
had
killed
five
men
Probably
he
had
killed
more
He
didn
t
believe
men
you
killed
haunted
you
Not
if
you
had
been
two
years
at
the
front
Most
of
the
men
he
had
known
had
been
excited
as
hell
when
they
had
first
killed
The
trouble
was
to
keep
them
from
killing
too
much
It
was
hard
to
get
prisoners
back
to
the
people
that
wanted
them
for
identification
You
sent
a
man
back
with
two
prisoners
maybe
you
sent
two
men
back
with
four
prisoners
What
happened
The
men
came
back
and
said
the
prisoners
were
knocked
out
by
the
barrage
They
would
give
the
prisoner
a
poke
in
the
seat
of
the
pants
with
a
bayonet
and
when
the
prisoner
jumped
they
would
say
You
would
run
you
son
of
a
bitch
and
let
their
gun
off
in
the
back
of
his
head
They
wanted
to
be
sure
they
had
killed
Also
they
didn
t
want
to
go
back
through
any
damn
barrage
No
sir
They
learned
those
kind
of
manners
from
the
Australians
After
all
what
were
those
Jerries
A
bunch
of
goddam
Huns
Huns
sounded
like
a
funny
word
now
All
this
sweetness
and
truth
Not
if
you
were
in
there
two
years
In
the
end
they
would
have
softened
Got
sorry
for
excesses
and
begun
to
store
up
good
deeds
against
getting
killed
themselves
But
that
was
the
fourth
phase
of
soldiering
the
gentling
down
In
a
good
soldier
in
the
war
it
went
like
this
First
you
were
brave
because
you
didn
t
think
anything
could
hit
you
because
you
yourself
were
something
special
and
you
knew
that
you
could
never
die
Then
you
found
out
different
You
were
really
scared
then
but
if
you
were
a
good
soldier
you
functioned
the
same
as
before
Then
after
you
were
wounded
and
not
killed
with
new
men
coming
on
and
going
through
your
old
processes
you
hardened
and
became
a
good
hard-boiled
soldier
Then
came
the
second
crack
which
is
much
worse
than
the
first
and
then
you
began
doing
good
deeds
and
being
the
boy
Sir
Philip
Sidney
and
storing
up
treasures
in
heaven
At
the
same
time
of
course
functioning
always
the
same
as
before
As
if
it
were
a
football
game
Nobody
had
any
damn
business
to
write
about
it
though
that
didn
t
at
least
know
about
it
from
hearsay
Literature
has
too
strong
an
effect
on
people
s
minds
Like
this
American
writer
Willa
Cather
who
wrote
a
book
about
the
war
where
all
the
last
part
of
it
was
taken
from
the
action
in
the
Birth
of
a
Nation
and
ex-servicemen
wrote
to
her
from
all
over
America
to
tell
her
how
much
they
liked
it
One
of
the
Indians
was
asleep
He
had
been
chewing
tobacco
and
his
mouth
was
pursed
up
in
sleep
He
was
leaning
on
the
other
Indian
s
shoulder
The
Indian
who
was
awake
pointed
at
the
other
Indian
who
was
asleep
and
shook
his
head
Well
how
did
you
like
the
speech
Yogi
asked
the
Indian
who
was
awake
White
chief
have
heap
much
sound
ideas
the
Indian
said
White
chief
educated
like
hell
Thank
you
Yogi
said
He
felt
touched
Here
among
the
simple
aborigines
the
only
real
Americans
he
had
found
that
true
communion
The
Indian
looked
at
him
holding
the
sleeping
Indian
carefully
that
his
head
might
not
fall
back
upon
the
snow-covered
logs
Was
white
chief
in
the
war
the
Indian
asked
I
landed
in
France
in
May
1917
Yogi
began
I
thought
maybe
white
chief
was
in
the
war
from
the
way
he
talked
the
Indian
said
Him
he
raised
the
head
of
his
sleeping
companion
up
so
the
last
rays
of
the
sunset
shone
on
the
sleeping
Indian
s
face
he
got
V.C
Me
I
got
D.S.O
and
M.C
with
bar
I
was
major
in
the
Fourth
C.M.R
s
I
m
glad
to
meet
you
Yogi
said
He
felt
strangely
humiliated
It
was
growing
dark
There
was
a
single
line
of
sunset
where
the
sky
and
the
water
met
way
out
on
Lake
Michigan
Yogi
watched
the
narrow
line
of
the
sunset
grow
darker
red
thin
to
a
mere
slit
and
then
fade
The
sun
was
down
behind
the
lake
Yogi
stood
up
from
the
pile
of
logs
The
Indian
stood
up
too
He
awakened
his
companion
and
the
Indian
who
had
been
sleeping
stood
up
and
looked
at
Yogi
Johnson
We
go
to
Petoskey
to
join
Salvation
Army
the
larger
and
more
wakeful
Indian
said
White
chief
come
too
said
the
smaller
Indian
who
had
been
asleep
I
ll
walk
in
with
you
Yogi
replied
Who
were
these
Indians
What
did
they
mean
to
him
With
the
sun
down
the
slushy
road
was
stiffening
It
was
freezing
again
After
all
maybe
spring
was
not
coming
Maybe
it
did
not
make
a
difference
that
he
did
not
want
a
woman
Now
that
the
spring
was
perhaps
not
coming
there
was
a
question
about
that
He
would
walk
into
town
with
the
Indians
and
look
for
a
beautiful
woman
and
try
and
want
her
He
turned
down
the
now
frozen
road
The
two
Indians
walked
by
his
side
They
were
all
bound
in
the
same
direction
Through
the
night
down
the
frozen
road
the
three
walked
into
Petoskey
They
had
been
silent
walking
along
the
frozen
road
Their
shoes
broke
the
new-formed
crusts
of
ice
Sometimes
Yogi
Johnson
stepped
through
a
thin
film
of
ice
into
a
pool
of
water
The
Indians
avoided
the
pools
of
water
They
came
down
the
hill
past
the
feed
store
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
Bear
River
their
boots
ringing
hollowly
on
the
frozen
planks
of
the
bridge
and
climbed
the
hill
that
led
past
Dr
Rumsey
s
house
and
the
Home
Tea-Room
up
to
the
pool-room
In
front
of
the
pool-room
the
two
Indians
stopped
White
chief
shoot
pool
the
big
Indian
asked
No
Yogi
Johnson
said
My
right
arm
was
crippled
in
the
war
White
chief
have
hard
luck
the
small
Indian
said
Shoot
one
game
Kelly
pool
He
got
both
arms
and
both
legs
shot
off
at
Ypres
the
big
Indian
said
in
an
aside
to
Yogi
Him
very
sensitive
All
right
Yogi
Johnson
said
I
ll
shoot
one
game
They
went
into
the
hot
smoke-filled
warmth
of
the
pool-room
They
obtained
a
table
and
took
down
cues
from
the
wall
As
the
little
Indian
reached
up
to
take
down
his
cue
Yogi
noticed
that
he
had
two
artificial
arms
They
were
brown
leather
and
were
both
buckled
on
at
the
elbow
On
the
smooth
green
cloth
under
the
bright
electric
lights
they
played
pool
At
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
half
Yogi
Johnson
found
that
he
owed
the
little
Indian
four
dollars
and
thirty
cents
You
shoot
a
pretty
nice
stick
he
remarked
to
the
small
Indian
Me
not
shoot
so
good
since
the
war
the
small
Indian
replied
White
chief
like
to
drink
a
little
asked
the
larger
Indian
Where
do
you
get
it
asked
Yogi
I
have
to
go
to
Cheboygan
for
mine
White
chief
come
with
red
brothers
the
big
Indian
said
They
left
the
pool-table
placed
their
cues
in
the
rack
on
the
wall
paid
at
the
counter
and
went
out
into
the
night
Along
the
dark
streets
men
were
sneaking
home
The
frost
had
come
and
frozen
everything
stiff
and
cold
The
chinook
had
not
been
a
real
chinook
after
all
Spring
had
not
yet
come
and
the
men
who
had
commenced
their
orgies
were
halted
by
the
chill
in
the
air
that
told
them
the
chinook
wind
had
been
a
fake
That
foreman
Yogi
thought
he
ll
catch
hell
to-morrow
Perhaps
it
had
all
been
engineered
by
the
pump-manufacturers
to
get
the
foreman
out
of
his
job
Such
things
were
done
Through
the
dark
of
the
night
men
were
sneaking
home
in
little
groups
The
two
Indians
walked
on
either
side
of
Yogi
They
turned
down
a
side
street
and
all
three
halted
before
a
building
that
looked
something
like
a
stable
It
was
a
stable
The
two
Indians
opened
the
door
and
Yogi
followed
them
inside
A
ladder
led
upstairs
to
the
floor
above
It
was
dark
inside
the
stable
but
one
of
the
Indians
lit
a
match
to
show
Yogi
the
ladder
The
little
Indian
climbed
up
first
the
metal
hinges
of
his
artificial
limbs
squeaking
as
he
climbed
Yogi
followed
him
and
the
other
Indian
climbed
last
lighting
Yogi
s
way
with
matches
The
little
Indian
knocked
on
the
roof
where
the
ladder
stopped
against
the
wall
There
was
an
answering
knock
The
little
Indian
knocked
in
answer
three
sharp
knocks
on
the
roof
above
his
head
A
trap-door
in
the
roof
was
raised
and
they
climbed
up
through
into
the
lighted
room
In
one
corner
of
the
room
there
was
a
bar
with
a
brass
rail
and
tall
spittoons
Behind
the
bar
was
a
mirror
Easy-chairs
were
all
around
the
room
There
was
a
pool-table
Magazines
on
sticks
hung
in
a
line
on
the
wall
There
was
a
framed
autographed
portrait
of
Henry
Wadsworth
Longfellow
on
the
wall
draped
in
the
American
flag
Several
Indians
were
sitting
in
the
easy-chairs
reading
A
little
group
stood
at
the
bar
Nice
little
club
eh
An
Indian
came
up
and
shook
hands
with
Yogi
I
see
you
almost
every
day
at
the
pump-factory
He
was
a
man
who
worked
at
one
of
the
machines
near
Yogi
in
the
factory
Another
Indian
came
up
and
shook
hands
with
Yogi
He
also
worked
in
the
pump-factory
Rotten
luck
about
the
chinook
he
said
Yes
Yogi
said
Just
a
false
alarm
Come
and
have
a
drink
the
first
Indian
said
I
m
with
a
party
Yogi
answered
Who
were
these
Indians
anyway
Bring
them
along
too
the
first
Indian
said
Always
room
for
one
more
Yogi
looked
around
him
The
two
Indians
who
had
brought
him
were
gone
Where
were
they
Then
he
saw
them
They
were
over
at
the
pool-table
The
tall
refined
Indian
to
whom
Yogi
was
talking
followed
his
glance
He
nodded
his
head
in
understanding
They
re
woods
Indians
he
explained
apologetically
We
re
most
of
us
town
Indians
here
Yes
of
course
Yogi
agreed
The
little
chap
has
a
very
good
war
record
the
tall
refined
Indian
remarked
The
other
chap
was
a
major
too
I
believe
Yogi
was
guided
over
to
the
bar
by
the
tall
refined
Indian
Behind
the
bar
was
the
bartender
He
was
a
Negro
How
would
some
Dog
s
Head
ale
go
asked
the
Indian
Fine
Yogi
said
Two
Dog
s
Heads
Bruce
the
Indian
remarked
to
the
bartender
The
bartender
broke
into
a
chuckle
What
are
you
laughing
at
Bruce
the
Indian
asked
The
Negro
broke
into
a
shrill
haunting
laugh
I
knowed
it
Massa
Red
Dog
he
said
I
knowed
you
d
ordah
dat
Dog
s
Head
all
the
time
He
s
a
merry
fellow
the
Indian
remarked
to
Yogi
I
must
introduce
myself
Red
Dog
s
the
name
Johnson
s
the
name
Yogi
said
Yogi
Johnson
Oh
we
are
all
quite
familiar
with
your
name
Mr
Johnson
Red
Dog
smiled
I
would
like
you
to
meet
my
friends
Mr
Sitting
Bull
Mr
Poisoned
Buffalo
and
Chief
Running
Skunk-Backwards
Sitting
Bull
s
a
name
I
know
Yogi
remarked
shaking
hands
Oh
I
m
not
one
of
those
Sitting
Bulls
Mr
Sitting
Bull
said
Chief
Running
Skunk-Backwards
s
great-grandfather
once
sold
the
entire
Island
of
Manhattan
for
a
few
strings
of
wampum
Red
Dog
explained
How
very
interesting
Yogi
said
That
was
a
costly
bit
of
wampum
for
our
family
Chief
Running
Skunk-Backwards
smiled
ruefully
Chief
Running
Skunk-Backwards
has
some
of
that
wampum
Would
you
like
to
see
it
Red
Dog
asked
Indeed
I
would
It
s
really
no
different
from
any
other
wampum
Skunk-Backwards
explained
deprecatingly
He
pulled
a
chain
of
wampum
out
of
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
Yogi
Johnson
Yogi
looked
at
it
curiously
What
a
part
that
string
of
wampum
had
played
in
this
America
of
ours
Would
you
like
to
have
one
or
two
wampums
for
a
keep-sake
Skunk-Backwards
asked
I
wouldn
t
like
to
take
your
wampum
Yogi
demurred
They
have
no
intrinsic
value
really
Skunk-Backwards
explained
detaching
one
or
two
wampums
from
the
string
Their
value
is
really
a
sentimental
one
to
Skunk-Backwards
s
family
Red
Dog
said
It
s
damned
decent
of
you
Mr
Skunk-Backwards
Yogi
said
It
s
nothing
Skunk-Backwards
said
You
d
do
the
same
for
me
in
a
moment
It
s
decent
of
you
Behind
the
bar
Bruce
the
Negro
bartender
had
been
leaning
forward
and
watching
the
wampums
pass
from
hand
to
hand
His
dark
face
shone
Sharply
without
explanation
he
broke
into
high-pitched
uncontrolled
laughter
The
dark
laughter
of
the
Negro
Red
Dog
looked
at
him
sharply
I
say
Bruce
he
spoke
sharply
your
mirth
is
a
little
ill-timed
Bruce
stopped
laughing
and
wiped
his
face
on
a
towel
He
rolled
his
eyes
apologetically
Ah
can
t
help
it
Massa
Red
Dog
When
I
seen
Mistah
Skunk-Backhouse
passin
dem
wampums
around
I
jess
couldn
t
stand
it

longa
Whad

New
Yawk

for
Wampums
Take

Bruce
is
an
eccentric
Red
Dog
explained
but
he
s
a
corking
bartender
and
a
good-hearted
chap
Youah
right
theah
Massa
Red
Dog
the
bartender
leaned
forward
I
se
got
a
heart
of
puah
gold
He
is
an
eccentric
though
Red
Dog
apologized
The
house
committee
are
always
after
me
to
get
another
bartender
but
I
like
the
chap
oddly
enough
I
m
all
right
boss
Bruce
said
It
s
just
that
when
I
see
something
funny
I
just
have
to
laff
You
know
I
don
mean
no
harm
boss
Right
enough
Bruce
Red
Dog
agreed
You
are
an
honest
chap
Yogi
Johnson
looked
about
the
room
The
other
Indians
had
gone
away
from
the
bar
and
Skunk-Backwards
was
showing
the
wampum
to
a
little
group
of
Indians
in
dinner
dress
who
had
just
come
in
At
the
pool-table
the
two
woods
Indians
were
still
playing
They
had
removed
their
coats
and
the
light
above
the
pool-table
glinted
on
the
metal
joints
in
the
little
woods
Indian
s
artificial
arms
He
had
just
run
the
table
for
the
eleventh
consecutive
time
That
little
chap
would
have
made
a
pool-player
if
he
hadn
t
had
a
bit
of
hard
luck
in
the
war
Red
Dog
remarked
Would
you
like
to
have
a
look
about
the
club
He
took
the
check
from
Bruce
signed
it
and
Yogi
followed
him
into
the
next
room
Our
committee
room
Red
Dog
said
On
the
walls
were
framed
autographed
photographs
of
Chief
Bender
Francis
Park-man
D
H
Lawrence
Chief
Meyers
Stewart
Edward
White
Mary
Austin
Jim
Thorpe
General
Custer
Glenn
Warner
Mabel
Dodge
and
a
full-length
oil
painting
of
Henry
Wadsworth
Longfellow
Beyond
the
committee
room
was
a
locker
room
with
a
small
plunge
bath
or
swimming-pool
It
s
really
ridiculously
small
for
a
club
Red
Dog
said
But
it
makes
a
comfortable
little
hole
to
pop
into
when
the
evenings
are
dull
He
smiled
We
call
it
the
wigwam
you
know
That
s
a
little
conceit
of
my
own
It
s
a
damned
nice
club
Yogi
said
enthusiastically
Put
you
up
if
you
like
Red
Dog
offered
What
s
your
tribe
What
do
you
mean
Your
tribe
What
are
you
Sac
and
Fox
Jibway
Cree
I
imagine
Oh
said
Yogi
My
parents
came
from
Sweden
Red
Dog
looked
at
him
closely
His
eyes
narrowed
You
re
not
having
me
on
No
They
either
came
from
Sweden
or
Norway
Yogi
said
I
d
have
sworn
you
looked
a
bit
on
the
white
side
Red
Dog
said
Damned
good
thing
this
came
out
in
time
There
d
have
been
no
end
of
scandal
He
put
his
hand
to
his
head
and
pursed
his
lips
Here
you
he
turned
suddenly
and
gripped
Yogi
by
the
vest
Yogi
felt
the
barrel
of
an
automatic
pushed
hard
against
his
stomach
You
ll
go
quietly
through
the
club-room
get
your
coat
and
hat
and
leave
as
though
nothing
had
happened
Say
polite
good-by
to
anyone
who
happens
to
speak
to
you
And
never
come
back
Get
that
you
Swede
Yes
said
Yogi
Put
up
your
gun
I
m
not
afraid
of
your
gun
Do
as
I
say
Red
Dog
ordered
As
for
those
two
pool-players
that
brought
you
here
I
ll
soon
have
them
out
of
this
Yogi
went
into
the
bright
room
looked
at
the
bar
where
Bruce
the
bartender
was
regarding
him
got
his
hat
and
coat
said
good-night
to
Skunk-Backwards
who
asked
him
why
he
was
leaving
so
early
and
the
outside
trap-door
was
swung
up
by
Bruce
As
Yogi
started
down
the
ladder
the
Negro
burst
out
laughing
I
knowed
it
he
laughed
I
knowed
it
all
de
time
No
Swede
gwine
to
fool
ole
Bruce
Yogi
looked
back
and
saw
the
laughing
black
face
of
the
Negro
framed
in
the
oblong
square
of
light
that
came
through
the
raised
trap-door
Once
on
the
stable
floor
Yogi
looked
around
him
He
was
alone
The
straw
of
the
old
stable
was
stiff
and
frozen
under
his
feet
Where
had
he
been
Had
he
been
in
an
Indian
club
What
was
it
all
about
Was
this
the
end
Above
him
a
slit
of
light
came
in
the
roof
Then
it
was
blocked
by
two
black
figures
there
was
the
sound
of
a
kick
a
blow
a
series
of
thuds
some
dull
some
sharp
and
two
human
forms
came
crashing
down
the
ladder
From
above
floated
the
dark
haunting
sound
of
black
Negro
laughter
The
two
woods
Indians
picked
themselves
up
from
the
straw
and
limped
toward
the
door
One
of
them
the
little
one
was
crying
Yogi
followed
them
out
into
the
cold
night
It
was
cold
The
night
was
clear
The
stars
were
out
Club
no
damn
good
the
big
Indian
said
