something
something
something
there
s
no
place
like
home
He
could
not
remember
the
words
Not
all
of
them
He
had
written
a
simple
tune
to
it
and
taught
Lucy
to
sing
it
That
was
when
they
first
were
married
Scripps
might
have
been
a
composer
one
of
these
chaps
that
write
the
stuff
the
Chicago
Symphony
Orchestra
plays
if
he
had
had
a
chance
to
go
on
He
would
get
Lucy
to
sing
that
song
tonight
He
would
never
drink
again
Drinking
robbed
him
of
his
ear
for
music
Times
when
he
was
drunk
the
sound
of
the
whistles
of
the
trains
at
night
pulling
up
the
Boyne
Falls
grade
seemed
more
lovely
than
anything
this
chap
Stravinsky
had
ever
written
Drinking
had
done
that
It
was
wrong
He
would
get
away
to
Paris
Like
this
chap
Albert
Spalding
that
played
the
violin
Scripps
opened
the
door
He
went
in
Lucy
he
called
it
is
I
Scripps
He
would
never
drink
again
No
more
nights
out
on
the
railroad
Perhaps
Lucy
needed
a
new
fur
coat
Perhaps
after
all
she
had
wanted
a
palace
instead
of
this
place
You
never
knew
how
you
were
treating
a
woman
Perhaps
after
all
this
place
was
not
keeping
out
the
wind
Fantastic
He
lit
a
match
Lucy
he
called
and
there
was
a
note
of
dumb
terror
in
his
mouth
His
friend
Walt
Simmons
had
heard
just
such
a
cry
from
a
stallion
that
had
once
been
run
over
by
a
passing
autobus
in
the
Place
Vend
me
in
Paris
In
Paris
there
were
no
geldings
All
the
horses
were
stallions
They
did
not
breed
mares
Not
since
the
war
The
war
changed
all
that
Lucy
he
called
and
again
Lucy
There
was
no
answer
The
house
was
empty
Through
the
snow-filled
air
as
he
stood
there
alone
in
his
tall
leanness
in
his
own
deserted
house
there
came
to
Scripps
s
ears
the
distant
sound
of
an
Indian
war-whoop
Scripps
left
Mancelona
He
was
through
with
that
place
What
had
a
town
like
that
to
give
him
There
was
nothing
to
it
You
worked
all
your
life
and
then
a
thing
like
that
happened
The
savings
of
years
wiped
out
Everything
gone
He
started
to
Chicago
to
get
a
job
Chicago
was
the
place
Look
at
its
geographical
situation
right
at
the
end
of
Lake
Michigan
Chicago
would
do
big
things
Any
fool
could
see
that
He
would
buy
land
in
what
is
now
the
Loop
the
big
shopping
and
manufacturing
district
He
would
buy
the
land
at
a
low
price
and
then
hang
onto
it
Let
them
try
and
get
it
away
from
him
He
knew
a
thing
or
two
now
Alone
bareheaded
the
snow
blowing
in
his
hair
he
walked
down
the
G
R
I
railway
tracks
It
was
the
coldest
night
he
had
ever
known
He
picked
up
a
dead
bird
that
had
frozen
and
fallen
onto
the
railroad
tracks
and
put
it
inside
his
shirt
to
warm
it
The
bird
nestled
close
to
his
warm
body
and
pecked
at
his
chest
gratefully
Poor
little
chap
Scripps
said
You
feel
the
cold
too
Tears
came
into
his
eyes
Drat
that
wind
Scripps
said
and
once
again
faced
into
the
blowing
snow
The
wind
was
blowing
straight
down
from
Lake
Superior
The
telegraph
wires
above
Scripps
s
head
sang
in
the
wind
Through
the
dark
Scripps
saw
a
great
yellow
eye
coming
toward
him
The
giant
locomotive
came
nearer
through
the
snow-storm
Scripps
stepped
to
one
side
of
the
track
to
let
it
go
by
What
is
it
that
old
writing
fellow
Shakespeare
says
Might
makes
right
Scripps
thought
of
that
quotation
as
the
train
went
past
him
in
the
snowing
darkness
First
the
engine
passed
He
saw
the
fireman
bending
to
fling
great
shovelfuls
of
coal
into
the
open
furnace
door
The
engineer
wore
goggles
His
face
was
lit
up
by
the
light
from
the
open
door
of
the
engine
He
was
the
engineer
It
was
he
who
had
his
hand
on
the
throttle
Scripps
thought
of
the
Chicago
anarchists
who
when
they
were
hanged
said
Though
you
throttle
us
today
still
you
can
not
something
something
our
souls
There
was
a
monument
where
they
were
buried
in
Waldheim
Cemetery
right
beside
the
Forest
Park
Amusement
Park
in
Chicago
His
father
used
to
take
Scripps
out
there
on
Sundays
The
monument
was
all
black
and
there
was
a
black
angel
That
was
when
Scripps
had
been
a
little
boy
He
used
often
to
ask
his
father
Father
why
if
we
come
to
look
at
the
anarchists
on
Sunday
why
can
t
we
ride
on
the
shoot
the
chutes
He
had
never
been
satisfied
with
his
father
s
answer
He
had
been
a
little
boy
in
knee
pants
then
His
father
had
been
a
great
composer
His
mother
was
an
Italian
woman
from
the
north
of
Italy
They
are
strange
people
these
north
Italians
Scripps
stood
beside
the
track
and
the
long
black
segments
of
the
train
clicked
by
him
in
the
snow
All
the
cars
were
Pullmans
The
blinds
were
down
Light
came
in
thin
slits
from
the
bottom
of
the
dark
windows
as
the
cars
went
by
The
train
did
not
roar
by
as
it
might
have
if
it
had
been
going
in
the
other
direction
because
it
was
climbing
the
Boyne
Falls
grade
It
went
slower
than
if
it
had
been
going
down
Still
it
went
too
fast
for
Scripps
to
hitch
on
He
thought
how
he
had
been
an
expert
at
hitching
on
grocery
wagons
when
he
was
a
young
boy
in
knee
pants
The
long
black
train
of
Pullman
cars
passed
Scripps
as
he
stood
beside
the
tracks
Who
were
in
those
cars
Were
they
Americans
piling
up
money
while
they
slept
Were
they
mothers
Were
they
fathers
Were
there
lovers
among
them
Or
were
they
Europeans
members
of
a
worn-out
civilization
world-weary
from
the
war
Scripps
wondered
The
last
car
passed
him
and
the
train
went
on
up
the
track
Scripps
watched
the
red
light
at
its
stern
disappearing
into
the
blackness
through
which
the
snowflakes
now
came
softly
The
bird
fluttered
inside
his
shirt
Scripps
started
along
the
ties
He
wanted
to
get
to
Chicago
that
night
if
possible
to
start
work
in
the
morning
The
bird
fluttered
again
It
was
not
so
feeble
now
Scripps
put
his
hand
on
it
to
still
its
little
bird
flutterings
The
bird
was
calmed
Scripps
strode
on
up
the
track
After
all
he
did
not
need
to
go
as
far
as
Chicago
There
were
other
places
What
if
that
critic
fellow
Henry
Mencken
had
called
Chicago
the
Literary
Capital
of
America
There
was
Grand
Rapids
Once
in
Grand
Rapids
he
could
start
in
in
the
furniture
business
Fortunes
had
been
made
that
way
Grand
Rapids
furniture
was
famous
wherever
young
couples
walked
in
the
evening
to
talk
of
home-making
He
remembered
a
sign
he
had
seen
in
Chicago
as
a
little
boy
His
mother
had
pointed
it
out
to
him
as
together
they
walked
barefoot
through
what
now
is
probably
the
Loop
begging
from
door
to
door
His
mother
loved
the
bright
flashing
of
the
electric
lights
in
the
sign
They
are
like
San
Miniato
in
my
native
Florence
she
told
Scripps
Look
at
them
my
son
she
said
for
some
day
your
music
will
be
played
there
by
the
Firenze
Symphony
Orchestra
Scripps
had
often
watched
the
sign
for
hours
while
his
mother
slept
wrapped
in
an
old
shawl
on
what
is
now
probably
the
Blackstone
Hotel
The
sign
had
made
a
great
impression
on
him
LET
HARTMAN
FEATHER
YOUR
NEST
it
had
said
It
flashed
in
many
different
colors
First
a
pure
dazzling
white
That
was
what
Scripps
loved
best
Then
it
flashed
a
lovely
green
Then
it
flashed
red
One
night
as
he
lay
crouched
against
his
mother
s
body
warmth
and
watched
the
sign
flash
a
policeman
came
up
You
ll
have
to
move
along
he
said
Ah
yes
there
was
big
money
to
be
made
in
the
furniture
business
if
you
knew
how
to
go
about
it
He
Scripps
knew
all
the
wrinkles
of
that
game
In
his
own
mind
it
was
settled
He
would
stop
at
Grand
Rapids
The
little
bird
fluttered
happily
now
Ah
what
a
beautiful
gilded
cage
I
ll
build
for
you
my
pretty
one
Scripps
said
exultantly
The
little
bird
pecked
him
confidently
Scripps
strode
on
in
the
storm
The
snow
was
beginning
to
drift
across
the
track
Borne
on
the
wind
there
came
to
Scripps
s
ears
the
sound
of
a
far-off
Indian
war-whoop
Where
was
Scripps
now
Walking
in
the
night
in
the
storm
he
had
become
confused
He
had
started
for
Chicago
after
that
dreadful
night
when
he
had
found
that
his
home
was
a
home
no
longer
Why
had
Lucy
left
What
had
become
of
Lousy
He
Scripps
did
not
know
Not
that
he
cared
That
was
all
behind
him
There
was
none
of
that
now
He
was
standing
knee-deep
in
snow
in
front
of
a
railway
station
On
the
railway
station
was
written
in
big
letters
PETOSKEY
There
were
a
pile
of
deer
shipped
down
by
hunters
from
the
Upper
Peninsula
of
Michigan
lying
piled
the
one
on
the
other
dead
and
stiff
and
drifted
half
over
with
snow
on
the
station
platform
Scripps
read
the
sign
again
Could
this
be
Petoskey
A
man
was
inside
the
station
tapping
something
back
of
a
wicketed
window
He
looked
out
at
Scripps
Could
he
be
a
telegrapher
Something
told
Scripps
that
he
was
He
stepped
out
of
the
snow-drift
and
approached
the
window
Behind
the
window
the
man
worked
busily
away
at
his
telegrapher
s
key
Are
you
a
telegrapher
asked
Scripps
Yes
sir
said
the
man
I
m
a
telegrapher
How
wonderful
The
telegrapher
eyed
him
suspiciously
After
all
what
was
this
man
to
him
Is
it
hard
to
be
a
telegrapher
Scripps
asked
He
wanted
to
ask
the
man
outright
if
this
was
Petoskey
He
did
not
know
this
great
northern
section
of
America
though
and
he
wished
to
be
polite
The
telegrapher
looked
at
him
curiously
Say
he
asked
are
you
a
fairy
No
Scripps
said
I
don
t
know
what
being
a
fairy
means
Well
said
the
telegrapher
what
do
you
carry
a
bird
around
for
Bird
asked
Scripps
What
bird
That
bird
that
s
sticking
out
of
your
shirt
Scripps
was
at
a
loss
What
sort
of
chap
was
this
telegrapher
What
sort
of
men
went
in
for
telegraphy
Were
they
like
composers
Were
they
like
artists
Were
they
like
writers
Were
they
like
the
advertising
men
who
write
the
ads
in
our
national
weeklies
Or
were
they
like
Europeans
drawn
and
wasted
by
the
war
their
best
years
behind
them
Could
he
tell
this
telegrapher
the
whole
story
Would
he
understand
I
started
home
he
began
I
passed
the
Mancelona
High
School
I
knew
a
girl
in
Mancelona
the
telegrapher
said
Maybe
you
knew
her
Ethel
Enright
It
was
no
good
going
on
He
would
cut
the
story
short
He
would
give
the
bare
essentials
Besides
it
was
beastly
cold
It
was
cold
standing
there
on
the
wind-swept
station
platform
Something
told
him
it
was
useless
to
go
on
He
looked
over
at
the
deer
lying
there
in
a
pile
stiff
and
cold
Perhaps
they
too
had
been
lovers
Some
were
bucks
and
some
were
does
The
bucks
had
horns
That
was
how
you
could
tell
With
cats
it
is
more
difficult
In
France
they
geld
the
cats
and
do
not
geld
the
horses
France
was
a
long
way
off
My
wife
left
me
Scripps
said
abruptly
I
don
t
wonder
if
you
go
around
with
a
damn
bird
sticking
out
of
your
shirt
the
telegrapher
said
What
town
is
this
Scripps
asked
The
single
moment
of
spiritual
communion
they
had
had
had
been
dissipated
They
had
never
really
had
it
But
they
might
have
It
was
no
use
now
It
was
no
use
trying
to
capture
what
had
gone
What
had
fled
Petoskey
the
telegrapher
replied
Thank
you
Scripps
said
He
turned
and
walked
into
the
silent
deserted
Northern
town
Luckily
he
had
four
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
his
pocket
He
had
sold
a
story
to
George
Horace
Lorimer
just
before
he
had
started
out
with
his
old
woman
on
that
drinking
trip
Why
had
he
gone
at
all
What
was
it
all
about
anyway
Coming
toward
him
down
the
street
came
two
Indians
They
looked
at
him
but
their
faces
did
not
change
Their
faces
remained
the
same
They
went
into
McCarthy
s
barber
shop
Scripps
O
Neil
stood
irresolutely
before
the
barber
shop
Inside
there
men
were
being
shaved
Other
men
no
different
were
having
their
hair
cut
Other
men
sat
against
the
wall
in
tall
chairs
and
smoked
awaiting
their
turn
in
the
barber
chairs
admiring
the
paintings
hung
on
the
wall
or
admiring
their
own
reflections
in
the
long
mirror
Should
he
Scripps
go
in
there
After
all
he
had
four
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
his
pocket
He
could
go
where
he
wanted
He
looked
once
again
irresolutely
It
was
an
inviting
prospect
the
society
of
men
the
warm
room
the
white
jackets
of
the
barbers
skillfully
snipping
away
with
their
scissors
or
drawing
their
blades
diagonally
through
the
lather
that
covered
the
face
of
some
man
who
was
getting
a
shave
They
could
use
their
tools
these
barbers
Somehow
it
wasn
t
what
he
wanted
He
wanted
something
different
He
wanted
to
eat
Besides
there
was
his
bird
to
look
after
Scripps
O
Neil
turned
his
back
on
the
barber
shop
and
strode
away
up
the
street
of
the
silently
frozen
Northern
town
On
his
right
as
he
walked
the
weeping
birches
their
branches
bare
of
leaves
hung
down
to
the
ground
heavy
with
snow
To
his
ears
came
the
sound
of
sleigh
bells
Perhaps
it
was
Christmas
In
the
South
little
children
would
be
shooting
off
firecrackers
and
crying
Christmas
Gift
Christmas
Gift
to
one
another
His
father
came
from
the
South
He
had
been
a
soldier
in
the
rebel
army
Way
back
in
Civil
War
days
Sherman
had
burned
their
house
down
on
his
March
to
the
Sea
War
is
hell
Sherman
had
said
But
you
see
how
it
is
Mrs
O
Neil
I
ve
got
to
do
it
He
had
touched
a
match
to
the
white-pillared
old
house
If
General
O
Neil
were
here
you
dastard
his
mother
had
said
speaking
in
her
broken
English
you
d
never
have
touched
a
match
to
that
house
Smoke
curled
up
from
the
old
house
The
fire
was
mounting
The
white
pillars
were
obscured
in
the
rising
smoke-wreaths
Scripps
had
held
close
to
his
mother
s
linsey-woolsey
dress
General
Sherman
climbed
back
onto
his
horse
and
made
a
low
bow
Mrs
O
Neil
he
said
and
Scripps
s
mother
always
said
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
even
if
he
was
a
damned
Yank
The
man
had
a
heart
sir
even
if
he
did
not
follow
its
dictates
Mrs
O
Neil
if
the
general
were
here
we
could
have
it
out
as
man
to
man
As
it
is
ma
am
war
being
what
it
is
I
must
burn
your
house
He
motioned
to
one
of
his
soldiers
who
ran
forward
and
threw
a
bucket
of
kerosene
on
the
flames
The
flames
rose
and
a
great
column
of
smoke
went
up
in
the
still
evening
air
At
least
General
Sherman
Scripps
s
mother
said
triumphantly
that
column
of
smoke
will
warn
the
other
loyal
daughters
of
the
Confederacy
that
you
are
coming
Sherman
bowed
That
is
the
risk
we
must
take
ma
am
He
clapped
spurs
to
his
horse
and
rode
away
his
long
white
hair
floating
on
the
wind
Neither
Scripps
nor
his
mother
ever
saw
him
again
Odd
that
he
should
think
of
that
incident
now
He
looked
up
Facing
him
was
a
sign
BROWN
S
BEANERY
THE
BEST
BY
TEST
He
would
go
in
and
eat
This
was
what
he
wanted
He
would
go
in
and
eat

BY

Ah
these
big
beanery
owners
were
wise
fellows
They
knew
how
to
get
the
customers
No

The
Saturday
Evening
Post
for
them
THE
BEST
BY
TEST
That
was
the
stuff
He
went
in
Inside
the
door
of
the
beanery
Scripps
O
Neil
looked
around
him
There
was
a
long
counter
There
was
a
clock
There
was
a
door
led
into
the
kitchen
There
were
a
couple
of
tables
There
were
a
pile
of
doughnuts
under
a
glass
cover
There
were
signs
put
about
on
the
wall
advertising
things
one
might
eat
Was
this
after
all
Brown
s
Beanery
I
wonder
Scripps
asked
an
elderly
waitress
who
came
in
through
the
swinging
door
from
the
kitchen
if
you
could
tell
me
if
this
is
Brown
s
Beanery
Yes
sir
answered
the
waitress
The
best
by
test
Thank
you
Scripps
said
He
sat
down
at
the
counter
I
would
like
to
have
some
beans
for
myself
and
some
for
my
bird
here
He
opened
his
shirt
and
placed
the
bird
on
the
counter
The
bird
ruffled
his
feathers
and
shook
himself
He
pecked
inquiringly
at
the
catsup
bottle
The
elderly
waitress
put
out
a
hand
and
stroked
him
Isn
t
he
a
manly
little
fellow
she
remarked
By
the
way
she
asked
a
little
shamefacedly
what
was
it
you
ordered
sir
Beans
Scripps
said
for
my
bird
and
myself
The
waitress
shoved
up
a
little
wicket
that
led
into
the
kitchen
Scripps
had
a
glimpse
of
a
warm
steam-filled
room
with
big
pots
and
kettles
and
many
shining
cans
on
the
wall
A
pig
and
the
noisy
ones
the
waitress
called
in
a
matter-of-fact
voice
into
the
open
wicket
One
for
a
bird
On
the
fire
a
voice
answered
from
the
kitchen
How
old
is
your
bird
the
elderly
waitress
asked
I
don
t
know
Scripps
said
I
never
saw
him
before
last
night
I
was
walking
on
the
railroad
track
from
Mancelona
My
wife
left
me
Poor
little
chap
the
waitress
said
She
poured
a
little
catsup
on
her
finger
and
the
bird
pecked
at
it
gratefully
My
wife
left
me
Scripps
said
We
d
been
out
drinking
on
the
railroad
track
We
used
to
go
out
evenings
and
watch
the
trains
pass
I
write
stories
I
had
a
story
in
The
Post
and
two
in
The
Dial
Mencken
s
trying
to
get
ahold
of
me
I
m
too
wise
for
that
sort
of
thing
No
politzei
for
mine
They
give
me
the
katzenjammers
What
was
he
saying
He
was
talking
wildly
This
would
never
do
He
must
pull
himself
together
Scofield
Thayer
was
my
best
man
he
said
I
m
a
Harvard
man
All
I
want
is
for
them
to
give
me
and
my
bird
a
square
deal
No
more
weltpolitik
Take
Dr
Coolidge
away
His
mind
was
wandering
He
knew
what
it
was
He
was
faint
with
hunger
This
Northern
air
was
too
sharp
too
keen
for
him
I
say
he
said
Could
you
let
me
have
just
a
few
of
those
beans
I
don
t
like
to
rush
things
I
know
when
to
let
well
enough
alone
The
wicket
came
up
and
a
large
plate
of
beans
and
a
small
plate
of
beans
both
steaming
appeared
Here
they
are
the
waitress
said
Scripps
fell
to
on
the
large
plate
of
beans
There
was
a
little
pork
too
The
bird
was
eating
happily
raising
its
head
after
each
swallow
to
let
the
beans
go
down
He
does
that
to
thank
God
for
those
beans
the
elderly
waitress
explained
They
re
mighty
fine
beans
too
Scripps
agreed
Under
the
influence
of
the
beans
his
head
was
clearing
What
was
this
rot
he
had
been
talking
about
that
man
Henry
Mencken
Was
Mencken
really
after
him
It
wasn
t
a
pretty
prospect
to
face
He
had
four
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
his
pocket
When
that
was
gone
he
could
always
put
an
end
to
things
If
they
pressed
him
too
far
they
would
get
a
big
surprise
He
wasn
t
the
man
to
be
taken
alive
Just
let
them
try
it
After
eating
his
beans
the
bird
had
fallen
asleep
He
was
sleeping
on
one
leg
the
other
leg
tucked
up
into
his
feathers
When
he
gets
tired
of
sleeping
on
that
leg
he
will
change
legs
and
rest
the
waitress
remarked
We
had
an
old
osprey
at
home
that
was
like
that
Where
was
your
home
Scripps
asked
In
England
In
the
Lake
District
The
waitress
smiled
a
bit
wistfully
Wordsworth
s
country
you
know
Ah
these
English
They
travelled
all
over
the
face
of
the
globe
They
were
not
content
to
remain
in
their
little
island
Strange
Nordics
obsessed
with
their
dream
of
empire
I
was
not
always
a
waitress
the
elderly
waitress
remarked
I
m
sure
you
weren
t
Not
half
the
waitress
went
on
It
s
rather
a
strange
story
Perhaps
it
would
bore
you
Not
at
all
Scripps
said
You
wouldn
t
mind
if
I
used
the
story
sometime
Not
if
you
find
it
interesting
the
waitress
smiled
You
wouldn
t
use
my
name
of
course
Not
if
you
d
rather
not
Scripps
said
By
the
way
could
I
have
another
order
of
beans
Best
by
test
the
waitress
smiled
Her
face
was
lined
and
gray
She
looks
a
little
like
that
actress
that
died
in
Pittsburgh
What
was
her
name
Lenore
Ulric
In
Peter
Pan
That
was
it
They
say
she
always
went
about
veiled
Scripps
thought
There
was
an
interesting
woman
Was
it
Lenore
Ulric
Perhaps
not
No
matter
You
really
want
some
more
beans
asked
the
waitress
Yes
Scripps
answered
simply
Once
again
on
the
loud
ones
the
waitress
called
into
the
wicket
Lay
off
the
bird
On
the
fire
came
the
response
Please
go
on
with
your
story
Scripps
said
kindly
It
was
the
year
of
the
Paris
Exposition
she
began
I
was
a
young
girl
at
the
time
a
jeune
fille
and
I
came
over
from
England
with
my
mother
We
were
going
to
be
present
at
the
opening
of
the
exposition
On
our
way
from
the
Gare
du
Nord
to
the
hotel
in
the
Place
Vend
me
where
we
lodged
we
stopped
at
a
coiffeur
s
shop
and
made
some
trifling
purchase
My
mother
as
I
recall
purchased
an
additional
bottle
of
smelling
salts
as
you
call
them
here
in
America
She
smiled
Yes
go
on
Smelling
salts
Scripps
said
We
registered
as
is
customary
in
the
hotel
and
were
given
the
adjoining
rooms
we
had
reserved
My
mother
felt
a
bit
done
in
by
the
trip
and
we
dined
in
our
rooms
I
was
full
of
excitement
about
seeing
the
exposition
on
the
morrow
But
I
was
tired
after
the
journey
we
had
had
a
rather
nasty
crossing
and
slept
soundly
In
the
morning
I
awoke
and
called
for
my
mother
There
was
no
answer
and
I
went
into
the
room
to
waken
Mummy
Instead
of
Mummy
there
was
a
French
general
in
the
bed
Mon
Dieu
Scripps
said
I
was
terribly
frightened
the
waitress
went
on
and
rang
the
bell
for
the
management
The
concierge
came
up
and
I
demanded
to
know
where
my
mother
was
But
mademoiselle
the
concierge
explained
we
know
nothing
about
your
mother
You
came
here
with
General
So-and-so
I
can
not
remember
the
general
s
name
Call
him
General
Joffre
Scripps
suggested
It
was
a
name
very
like
that
the
waitress
said
I
was
fearfully
frightened
and
sent
for
the
police
and
demanded
to
see
the
guest-register
You
ll
find
there
that
I
am
registered
with
my
mother
I
said
The
police
came
and
the
concierge
brought
up
the
register
See
madame
he
said
You
are
registered
with
the
general
with
whom
you
came
to
our
hotel
last
night
I
was
desperate
Finally
I
remembered
where
the
coiffeur
s
shop
was
The
police
sent
for
the
coiffeur
An
agent
of
police
brought
him
in
I
stopped
at
your
shop
with
my
mother
I
said
to
the
coiffeur
and
my
mother
bought
a
bottle
of
aromatic
salts
I
remember
mademoiselle
perfectly
the
coiffeur
said
But
you
were
not
with
your
mother
You
were
with
an
elderly
French
general
He
purchased
I
believe
a
pair
of
mustache
tongs
My
books
at
any
rate
will
show
the
purchase
I
was
in
despair
In
the
meantime
the
police
had
brought
in
the
cab
driver
who
had
brought
us
from
the
gare
to
the
hotel
He
swore
that
I
had
never
been
with
my
mother
Tell
me
does
this
story
bore
you
Go
on
said
Scripps
If
you
had
ever
been
as
hard
up
for
plots
as
I
have
been
Well
the
waitress
said
That
s
all
there
is
to
the
tale
I
never
saw
my
mother
again
I
communicated
with
the
embassy
but
they
could
do
nothing
It
was
finally
established
by
them
that
I
had
crossed
the
channel
with
my
mother
but
they
could
do
nothing
beyond
that
Tears
came
into
the
elderly
waitress
s
eyes
I
never
saw
Mummy
again
Never
again
Not
even
once
What
about
the
general
He
finally
loaned
me
one
hundred
francs
not
a
great
sum
even
in
those
days
and
I
came
to
America
and
became
a
waitress
That
s
all
there
is
to
the
story
There
s
more
than
that
Scripps
said
I
d
stake
my
life
there
s
more
than
that
Sometimes
you
know
I
feel
there
is
the
waitress
said
I
feel
there
must
be
more
than
that
Somewhere
somehow
there
must
be
an
explanation
I
don
t
know
what
brought
the
subject
into
my
mind
this
morning
It
was
a
good
thing
to
get
it
off
your
mind
Scripps
said
Yes
the
waitress
smiled
the
lines
in
her
face
not
quite
so
deep
now
I
feel
better
now
Tell
me
Scripps
asked
the
waitress
Is
there
any
work
in
this
town
for
me
and
my
bird
Honest
work
asked
the
waitress
I
only
know
of
honest
work
Yes
honest
work
Scripps
said
They
do
say
they
re
hiring
hands
at
the
new
pump-factory
the
waitress
said
Why
shouldn
t
he
work
with
his
hands
Rodin
had
done
it
C
zanne
had
been
a
butcher
Renoir
a
carpenter
Picasso
had
worked
in
a
cigarette-factory
in
his
boyhood
Gilbert
Stuart
who
painted
those
famous
portraits
of
Washington
that
are
reproduced
all
over
this
America
of
ours
and
hang
in
every
schoolroom
Gilbert
Stuart
had
been
a
blacksmith
Then
there
was
Emerson
Emerson
had
been
a
hod-carrier
James
Russell
Lowell
had
been
he
had
heard
a
telegraph
operator
in
his
youth
Like
that
chap
down
at
the
station
Perhaps
even
now
that
telegrapher
at
the
station
was
working
on
his
Thanatopsis
or
his
To
a
Waterfowl
Why
shouldn
t
he
Scripps
O
Neil
work
in
a
pump-factory
You
ll
come
back
again
the
waitress
asked
If
I
may
Scripps
said
And
bring
your
bird
Yes
Scripps
said
The
little
chap
s
rather
tired
now
After
all
it
was
a
hard
night
for
him
I
should
say
it
was
agreed
the
waitress
Scripps
went
out
again
into
the
town
He
felt
clearheaded
and
ready
to
face
life
A
pump-factory
would
be
interesting
Pumps
were
big
things
now
Fortunes
were
made
and
lost
in
pumps
every
day
in
New
York
in
Wall
Street
He
knew
of
a
chap
who
d
cleaned
up
a
cool
half-million
on
pumps
in
less
than
half
an
hour
They
knew
what
they
were
about
these
big
Wall
Street
operators
Outside
on
the
street
he
looked
up
at
the
sign
BEST
BY
TEST
he
read
They
had
the
dope
all
right
he
said
Was
it
true
though
that
there
had
been
a
Negro
cook
Just
once
just
for
one
moment
when
the
wicket
went
up
he
thought
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
black
Perhaps
the
chap
was
only
sooty
from
the
stove
Part
Two
The
Struggle
for
Life
And
here
I
solemnly
protest
I
have
no
intention
to
vilify
or
asperse
any
one
for
though
everything
is
copied
from
the
book
of
nature
and
scarce
a
character
or
action
produced
which
I
have
not
taken
from
my
own
observations
or
experience
yet
I
have
used
the
utmost
care
to
obscure
the
persons
by
such
different
circumstances
degrees
and
colors
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
guess
at
them
with
any
degree
of
certainty
and
if
it
ever
happens
otherwise
it
is
only
where
the
failure
characterized
is
so
minute
that
it
is
a
foible
only
which
the
party
himself
may
laugh
at
as
well
as
any
other
HENRY
FIELDING
Scripps
O
Neil
was
looking
for
employment
It
would
be
good
to
work
with
his
hands
He
walked
down
the
street
away
from
the
beanery
and
past
McCarthy
s
barber
shop
He
did
not
go
into
the
barber
shop
It
looked
as
inviting
as
ever
but
it
was
employment
Scripps
wanted
He
turned
sharply
around
the
corner
of
the
barber
shop
and
onto
the
Main
Street
of
Petoskey
It
was
a
handsome
broad
street
lined
on
either
side
with
brick
and
pressed-stone
buildings
Scripps
walked
along
it
toward
the
part
of
town
where
the
pump-factory
stood
At
the
door
of
the
pump-factory
he
was
embarrassed
Could
this
really
be
the
pump-factory
True
a
stream
of
pumps
were
being
carried
out
and
set
up
in
the
snow
and
workmen
were
throwing
pails
of
water
over
them
to
encase
them
in
a
coating
of
ice
that
would
protect
them
from
the
winter
winds
as
well
as
any
paint
would
But
were
they
really
pumps
It
might
all
be
a
trick
These
pump
men
were
clever
fellows
I
say
Scripps
beckoned
to
one
of
the
workmen
who
was
sloshing
water
over
a
new
raw-looking
pump
that
had
just
been
carried
out
and
stood
protestingly
in
the
snow
Are
they
