's
got
a
bet
on
it
you
precious
innocent
you
noodle
Blinkard
'Well
come
in
simpleton
retorted
the
Blinkard
'Then
give
us
a
kiss
at
least
lovey
stammered
the
Gabbler
opening
wide
his
arms
'Get
out
you
great
softy
responded
the
Blinkard
contemptuously
giving
him
a
poke
with
his
elbow
and
both
stooping
entered
the
low
doorway
The
conversation
I
had
overheard
roused
my
curiosity
exceedingly
More
than
once
rumours
had
reached
me
of
Yashka
the
Turk
as
the
best
singer
in
the
vicinity
and
here
was
an
opportunity
all
at
once
of
hearing
him
in
competition
with
another
master
of
the
art
I
quickened
my
steps
and
went
into
the
house
Few
of
my
readers
have
probably
had
an
opportunity
of
getting
a
good
view
of
any
village
taverns
but
we
sportsmen
go
everywhere
They
are
constructed
on
an
exceedingly
simple
plan
They
usually
consist
of
a
dark
outer-shed
and
an
inner
room
with
a
chimney
divided
in
two
by
a
partition
behind
which
none
of
the
customers
have
a
right
to
go
In
this
partition
there
is
a
wide
opening
cut
above
a
broad
oak
table
At
this
table
or
bar
the
spirits
are
served
Sealed
up
bottles
of
various
sizes
stand
on
the
shelves
right
opposite
the
opening
In
the
front
part
of
the
room
devoted
to
customers
there
are
benches
two
or
three
empty
barrels
and
a
corner
table
Village
taverns
are
for
the
most
part
rather
dark
and
you
hardly
ever
see
on
their
wainscotted
walls
any
of
the
glaring
cheap
prints
which
few
huts
are
without
When
I
went
into
the
Welcome
Resort
a
fairly
large
party
were
already
assembled
there
In
his
usual
place
behind
the
bar
almost
filling
up
the
entire
opening
in
the
partition
stood
Nikolai
Ivanitch
in
a
striped
print
shirt
with
a
lazy
smile
on
his
full
face
he
poured
out
with
his
plump
white
hand
two
glasses
of
spirits
for
the
Blinkard
and
the
Gabbler
as
they
came
in
behind
him
in
a
corner
near
the
window
could
be
seen
his
sharp-eyed
wife
In
the
middle
of
the
room
was
standing
Yashka
the
Turk
a
thin
graceful
fellow
of
three-and-twenty
dressed
in
a
long
skirted
coat
of
blue
nankin
He
looked
a
smart
factory
hand
and
could
not
to
judge
by
his
appearance
boast
of
very
good
health
His
hollow
cheeks
his
large
restless
grey
eyes
his
straight
nose
with
its
delicate
mobile
nostrils
his
pale
brown
curls
brushed
back
over
the
sloping
white
brow
his
full
but
beautiful
expressive
lips
and
his
whole
face
betrayed
a
passionate
and
sensitive
nature
He
was
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
he
blinked
his
breathing
was
hurried
his
hands
shook
as
though
in
fever
and
he
was
really
in
a
fever
that
sudden
fever
of
excitement
which
is
so
well-known
to
all
who
have
to
speak
and
sing
before
an
audience
Near
him
stood
a
man
of
about
forty
with
broad
shoulders
and
broad
jaws
with
a
low
forehead
narrow
Tartar
eyes
a
short
flat
nose
a
square
chin
and
shining
black
hair
coarse
as
bristles
The
expression
of
his
face
a
swarthy
face
with
a
sort
of
leaden
hue
in
it
and
especially
of
his
pale
lips
might
almost
have
been
called
savage
if
it
had
not
been
so
still
and
dreamy
He
hardly
stirred
a
muscle
he
only
looked
slowly
about
him
like
a
bull
under
the
yoke
He
was
dressed
in
a
sort
of
surtout
not
over
new
with
smooth
brass
buttons
an
old
black
silk
handkerchief
was
twisted
round
his
immense
neck
He
was
called
the
Wild
Master
Right
opposite
him
on
a
bench
under
the
holy
pictures
was
sitting
Yashka
's
rival
the
booth-keeper
from
Zhizdry
he
was
a
short
stoutly-built
man
about
thirty
pock-marked
and
curly-headed
with
a
blunt
turn-up
nose
lively
brown
eyes
and
a
scanty
beard
He
looked
keenly
about
him
and
sitting
with
his
hands
under
him
he
kept
carelessly
swinging
his
legs
and
tapping
with
his
feet
which
were
encased
in
stylish
top-boots
with
a
coloured
edging
He
wore
a
new
thin
coat
of
grey
cloth
with
a
plush
collar
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
crimson
shirt
below
buttoned
close
across
the
chest
In
the
opposite
corner
to
the
right
of
the
door
a
peasant
sat
at
the
table
in
a
narrow
shabby
smock-frock
with
a
huge
rent
on
the
shoulder
The
sunlight
fell
in
a
narrow
yellowish
streak
through
the
dusty
panes
of
the
two
small
windows
but
it
seemed
as
if
it
struggled
in
vain
with
the
habitual
darkness
of
the
room
all
the
objects
in
it
were
dimly
as
it
were
patchily
lighted
up
On
the
other
hand
it
was
almost
cool
in
the
room
and
the
sense
of
stifling
heat
dropped
off
me
like
a
weary
load
directly
I
crossed
the
threshold
My
entrance
I
could
see
was
at
first
somewhat
disconcerting
to
Nikolai
Ivanitch
's
customers
but
observing
that
he
greeted
me
as
a
friend
they
were
reassured
and
took
no
more
notice
of
me
I
asked
for
some
beer
and
sat
down
in
the
corner
near
the
peasant
in
the
ragged
smock
'Well
well
piped
the
Gabbler
suddenly
draining
a
glass
of
spirits
at
one
gulp
and
accompanying
his
exclamation
with
the
strange
gesticulations
without
which
he
seemed
unable
to
utter
a
single
word
'what
are
we
waiting
for
If
we
're
going
to
begin
then
begin
Hey
Yasha
'Begin
begin
chimed
in
Nikolai
Ivanitch
approvingly
'Let
's
begin
by
all
means
observed
the
booth-keeper
coolly
with
a
self-confident
smile
'I
'm
ready
'And
I
'm
ready
Yakov
pronounced
in
a
voice
thrilled
with
excitement
'Well
begin
lads
whined
the
Blinkard
But
in
spite
of
the
unanimously
expressed
desire
neither
began
the
booth-keeper
did
not
even
get
up
from
the
bench
they
all
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
something
'Begin
said
the
Wild
Master
sharply
and
sullenly
Yashka
started
The
booth-keeper
pulled
down
his
girdle
and
cleared
his
throat
'But
who
's
to
begin
he
inquired
in
a
slightly
changed
voice
of
the
Wild
Master
who
still
stood
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
room
his
stalwart
legs
wide
apart
and
his
powerful
arms
thrust
up
to
the
elbow
into
his
breeches
pockets
'You
you
booth-keeper
stammered
the
Gabbler
'you
to
be
sure
brother
The
Wild
Master
looked
at
him
from
under
his
brows
The
Gabbler
gave
a
faint
squeak
in
confusion
looked
away
at
the
ceiling
twitched
his
shoulder
and
said
no
more
'Cast
lots
the
Wild
Master
pronounced
emphatically
'and
the
pot
on
the
table
Nikolai
Ivanitch
bent
down
and
with
a
gasp
picked
up
the
pot
of
beer
from
the
floor
and
set
it
on
the
table
The
Wild
Master
glanced
at
Yakov
and
said
'Come
Yakov
fumbled
in
his
pockets
took
out
a
halfpenny
and
marked
it
with
his
teeth
The
booth-keeper
pulled
from
under
the
skirts
of
his
long
coat
a
new
leather
purse
deliberately
untied
the
string
and
shaking
out
a
quantity
of
small
change
into
his
hand
picked
out
a
new
halfpenny
The
Gabbler
held
out
his
dirty
cap
with
its
broken
peak
hanging
loose
Yakov
dropped
his
halfpenny
in
and
the
booth-keeper
his
'You
must
pick
out
one
said
the
Wild
Master
turning
to
the
Blinkard
The
Blinkard
smiled
complacently
took
the
cap
in
both
hands
and
began
shaking
it
For
an
instant
a
profound
silence
reigned
the
halfpennies
clinked
faintly
jingling
against
each
other
I
looked
round
attentively
every
face
wore
an
expression
of
intense
expectation
the
Wild
Master
himself
showed
signs
of
uneasiness
my
neighbour
even
the
peasant
in
the
tattered
smock
craned
his
neck
inquisitively
The
Blinkard
put
his
hand
into
the
cap
and
took
out
the
booth-keeper
's
halfpenny
every
one
drew
a
long
breath
Yakov
flushed
and
the
booth-keeper
passed
his
hand
over
his
hair
'There
I
said
you
'd
begin
cried
the
Gabbler
'did
n't
I
say
so
'There
there
do
n't
cluck
remarked
the
Wild
Master
contemptuously
'Begin
he
went
on
with
a
nod
to
the
booth-keeper
'What
song
am
I
to
sing
asked
the
booth-keeper
beginning
to
be
nervous
'What
you
choose
answered
the
Blinkard
'sing
what
you
think
best
'What
you
choose
to
be
sure
Nikolai
Ivanitch
chimed
in
slowly
smoothing
his
hand
on
his
breast
'you
're
quite
at
liberty
about
that
Sing
what
you
like
only
sing
well
and
we
'll
give
a
fair
decision
afterwards
'A
fair
decision
of
course
put
in
the
Gabbler
licking
the
edge
of
his
empty
glass
'Let
me
clear
my
throat
a
bit
mates
said
the
booth-keeper
fingering
the
collar
of
his
coat
'Come
come
no
nonsense
begin
protested
the
Wild
Master
and
he
looked
down
The
booth-keeper
thought
a
minute
shook
his
head
and
stepped
forward
Yakov
's
eyes
were
riveted
upon
him
But
before
I
enter
upon
a
description
of
the
contest
itself
I
think
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
say
a
few
words
about
each
of
the
personages
taking
part
in
my
story
The
lives
of
some
of
them
were
known
to
me
already
when
I
met
them
in
the
Welcome
Resort
I
collected
some
facts
about
the
others
later
on
Let
us
begin
with
the
Gabbler
This
man
's
real
name
was
Evgraf
Ivanovitch
but
no
one
in
the
whole
neighbourhood
knew
him
as
anything
but
the
Gabbler
and
he
himself
referred
to
himself
by
that
nickname
so
well
did
it
fit
him
Indeed
nothing
could
have
been
more
appropriate
to
his
insignificant
ever-restless
features
He
was
a
dissipated
unmarried
house-serf
whose
own
masters
had
long
ago
got
rid
of
him
and
who
without
any
employment
without
earning
a
halfpenny
found
means
to
get
drunk
every
day
at
other
people
's
expense
He
had
a
great
number
of
acquaintances
who
treated
him
to
drinks
of
spirits
and
tea
though
they
could
not
have
said
why
they
did
so
themselves
for
far
from
being
entertaining
in
company
he
bored
every
one
with
his
meaningless
chatter
his
insufferable
familiarity
his
spasmodic
gestures
and
incessant
unnatural
laugh
He
could
neither
sing
nor
dance
he
had
never
said
a
clever
or
even
a
sensible
thing
in
his
life
he
chattered
away
telling
lies
about
everything
a
regular
Gabbler
And
yet
not
a
single
drinking
party
for
thirty
miles
around
took
place
without
his
lank
figure
turning
up
among
the
guests
so
that
they
were
used
to
him
by
now
and
put
up
with
his
presence
as
a
necessary
evil
They
all
it
is
true
treated
him
with
contempt
but
the
Wild
Master
was
the
only
one
who
knew
how
to
keep
his
foolish
sallies
in
check
The
Blinkard
was
not
in
the
least
like
the
Gabbler
His
nickname
too
suited
him
though
he
was
no
more
given
to
blinking
than
other
people
it
is
a
well-known
fact
that
the
Russian
peasants
have
a
talent
for
finding
good
nicknames
In
spite
of
my
endeavours
to
get
more
detailed
information
about
this
man
's
past
many
passages
in
his
life
have
remained
spots
of
darkness
to
me
and
probably
to
many
other
people
episodes
buried
as
the
bookmen
say
in
the
darkness
of
oblivion
I
could
only
find
out
that
he
was
once
a
coachman
in
the
service
of
an
old
childless
lady
that
he
had
run
away
with
three
horses
he
was
in
charge
of
had
been
lost
for
a
whole
year
and
no
doubt
convinced
by
experience
of
the
drawbacks
and
hardships
of
a
wandering
life
he
had
gone
back
a
cripple
and
flung
himself
at
his
mistress
's
feet
He
succeeded
in
a
few
years
in
smoothing
over
his
offence
by
his
exemplary
conduct
and
gradually
getting
higher
in
her
favour
at
last
gained
her
complete
confidence
was
made
a
bailiff
and
on
his
mistress
's
death
turned
out
in
what
way
was
never
known
to
have
received
his
freedom
He
got
admitted
into
the
class
of
tradesmen
rented
patches
of
market
garden
from
the
neighbours
grew
rich
and
now
was
living
in
ease
and
comfort
He
was
a
man
of
experience
who
knew
on
which
side
his
bread
was
buttered
was
more
actuated
by
prudence
than
by
either
good
or
ill-nature
had
knocked
about
understood
men
and
knew
how
to
turn
them
to
his
own
advantage
He
was
cautious
and
at
the
same
time
enterprising
like
a
fox
though
he
was
as
fond
of
gossip
as
an
old
woman
he
never
let
out
his
own
affairs
while
he
made
everyone
else
talk
freely
of
theirs
He
did
not
affect
to
be
a
simpleton
though
as
so
many
crafty
men
of
his
sort
do
indeed
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
him
to
take
any
one
in
in
that
way
I
have
never
seen
a
sharper
keener
pair
of
eyes
than
his
tiny
cunning
little
'peepers
as
they
call
them
in
Orel
They
were
never
simply
looking
about
they
were
always
looking
one
up
and
down
and
through
and
through
The
Blinkard
would
sometimes
ponder
for
weeks
together
over
some
apparently
simple
undertaking
and
again
he
would
suddenly
decide
on
a
desperately
bold
line
of
action
which
one
would
fancy
would
bring
him
to
ruin
But
it
would
be
sure
to
turn
out
all
right
everything
would
go
smoothly
He
was
lucky
and
believed
in
his
own
luck
and
believed
in
omens
He
was
exceedingly
superstitious
in
general
He
was
not
liked
because
he
would
have
nothing
much
to
do
with
anyone
but
he
was
respected
His
whole
family
consisted
of
one
little
son
whom
he
idolised
and
who
brought
up
by
such
a
father
is
likely
to
get
on
in
the
world
'Little
Blinkard
'll
be
his
father
over
again
is
said
of
him
already
in
undertones
by
the
old
men
as
they
sit
on
their
mud
walls
gossiping
on
summer
evenings
and
every
one
knows
what
that
means
there
is
no
need
to
say
more
As
to
Yashka
the
Turk
and
the
booth-keeper
there
is
no
need
to
say
much
about
them
Yakov
called
the
Turk
because
he
actually
was
descended
from
a
Turkish
woman
a
prisoner
from
the
war
was
by
nature
an
artist
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
by
calling
a
ladler
in
a
paper
factory
belonging
to
a
merchant
As
for
the
booth-keeper
his
career
I
must
own
I
know
nothing
of
he
struck
me
as
being
a
smart
townsman
of
the
tradesman
class
ready
to
turn
his
hand
to
anything
But
the
Wild
Master
calls
for
a
more
detailed
account
The
first
impression
the
sight
of
this
man
produced
on
you
was
a
sense
of
coarse
heavy
irresistible
power
He
was
clumsily
built
a
'shambler
as
they
say
about
us
but
there
was
an
air
of
triumphant
vigour
about
him
and
strange
to
say
his
bear-like
figure
was
not
without
a
certain
grace
of
its
own
proceeding
perhaps
from
his
absolutely
placid
confidence
in
his
own
strength
It
was
hard
to
decide
at
first
to
what
class
this
Hercules
belonged
he
did
not
look
like
a
house-serf
nor
a
tradesman
nor
an
impoverished
clerk
out
of
work
nor
a
small
ruined
landowner
such
as
takes
to
being
a
huntsman
or
a
fighting
man
he
was
in
fact
quite
individual
No
one
knew
where
he
came
from
or
what
brought
him
into
our
district
it
was
said
that
he
came
of
free
peasant-proprietor
stock
and
had
once
been
in
the
government
service
somewhere
but
nothing
positive
was
known
about
this
and
indeed
there
was
no
one
from
whom
one
could
learn
certainly
not
from
him
he
was
the
most
silent
and
morose
of
men
So
much
so
that
no
one
knew
for
certain
what
he
lived
on
he
followed
no
trade
visited
no
one
associated
with
scarcely
anyone
yet
he
had
money
to
spend
little
enough
it
is
true
still
he
had
some
In
his
behaviour
he
was
not
exactly
retiring
retiring
was
not
a
word
that
could
be
applied
to
him
he
lived
as
though
he
noticed
no
one
about
him
and
cared
for
no
one
The
Wild
Master
that
was
the
nickname
they
had
given
him
his
real
name
was
Perevlyesov
enjoyed
an
immense
influence
in
the
whole
district
he
was
obeyed
with
eager
promptitude
though
he
had
no
kind
of
right
to
give
orders
to
anyone
and
did
not
himself
evince
the
slightest
pretension
to
authority
over
the
people
with
whom
he
came
into
casual
contact
He
spoke
they
obeyed
strength
always
has
an
influence
of
its
own
He
scarcely
drank
at
all
had
nothing
to
do
with
women
and
was
passionately
fond
of
singing
There
was
much
that
was
mysterious
about
this
man
it
seemed
as
though
vast
forces
sullenly
reposed
within
him
knowing
as
it
were
that
once
roused
once
bursting
free
they
were
bound
to
crush
him
and
everything
they
came
in
contact
with
and
I
am
greatly
mistaken
if
in
this
man
's
life
there
had
not
been
some
such
outbreak
if
it
was
not
owing
to
the
lessons
of
experience
to
a
narrow
escape
from
ruin
that
he
now
kept
himself
so
tightly
in
hand
What
especially
struck
me
in
him
was
the
combination
of
a
sort
of
inborn
natural
ferocity
with
an
equally
inborn
generosity
a
combination
I
have
never
met
in
any
other
man
And
so
the
booth-keeper
stepped
forward
and
half
shutting
his
eyes
began
singing
in
high
falsetto
He
had
a
fairly
sweet
and
pleasant
voice
though
rather
hoarse
he
played
with
his
voice
like
a
woodlark
twisting
and
turning
it
in
incessant
roulades
and
trills
up
and
down
the
scale
continually
returning
to
the
highest
notes
which
he
held
and
prolonged
with
special
care
Then
he
would
break
off
and
again
suddenly
take
up
the
first
motive
with
a
sort
of
go-ahead
daring
His
modulations
were
at
times
rather
bold
at
times
rather
comical
they
would
have
given
a
connoisseur
great
satisfaction
and
have
made
a
German
furiously
indignant
He
was
a
Russian
tenore
di
grazia
t
nor
l
ger
He
sang
a
song
to
a
lively
dance-tune
the
words
of
which
all
that
I
could
catch
through
the
endless
maze
of
variations
ejaculations
and
repetitions
were
as
follows
'A
tiny
patch
of
land
young
lass
I
'll
plough
for
thee
And
tiny
crimson
flowers
young
lass
I
'll
sow
for
thee
He
sang
all
listened
to
him
with
great
attention
He
seemed
to
feel
that
he
had
to
do
with
really
musical
people
and
therefore
was
exerting
himself
to
do
his
best
And
they
really
are
musical
in
our
part
of
the
country
the
village
of
Sergievskoe
on
the
Orel
highroad
is
deservedly
noted
throughout
Russia
for
its
harmonious
chorus-singing
The
booth-keeper
sang
for
a
long
while
without
evoking
much
enthusiasm
in
his
audience
he
lacked
the
support
of
a
chorus
but
at
last
after
one
particularly
bold
flourish
which
set
even
the
Wild
Master
smiling
the
Gabbler
could
not
refrain
from
a
shout
of
delight
Everyone
was
roused
The
Gabbler
and
the
Blinkard
began
joining
in
in
an
undertone
and
exclaiming
'Bravely
done
Take
it
you
rogue
Sing
it
out
you
serpent
Hold
it
That
shake
again
you
dog
you
May
Herod
confound
your
soul
and
so
on
Nikolai
Ivanitch
behind
the
bar
was
nodding
his
head
from
side
to
side
approvingly
The
Gabbler
at
last
was
swinging
his
legs
tapping
with
his
feet
and
twitching
his
shoulder
while
Yashka's
eyes
fairly
glowed
like
coal
and
he
trembled
all
over
like
a
leaf
and
smiled
nervously
The
Wild
Master
alone
did
not
change
countenance
and
stood
motionless
as
before
but
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
booth-keeper
looked
somewhat
softened
though
the
expression
of
his
lips
was
still
scornful
Emboldened
by
the
signs
of
general
approbation
the
booth-keeper
went
off
in
a
whirl
of
flourishes
and
began
to
round
off
such
trills
to
turn
such
shakes
off
his
tongue
and
to
make
such
furious
play
with
his
throat
that
when
at
last
pale
exhausted
and
bathed
in
hot
perspiration
he
uttered
the
last
dying
note
his
whole
body
flung
back
a
general
united
shout
greeted
him
in
a
violent
outburst
The
Gabbler
threw
himself
on
his
neck
and
began
strangling
him
in
his
long
bony
arms
a
flush
came
out
on
Nikolai
Ivanitch
's
oily
face
and
he
seemed
to
have
grown
younger
Yashka
shouted
like
mad
'Capital
capital
even
my
neighbour
the
peasant
in
the
torn
smock
could
not
restrain
himself
and
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
on
the
table
he
cried
'Aha
well
done
damn
my
soul
well
done
And
he
spat
on
one
side
with
an
air
of
decision
'Well
brother
you
've
given
us
a
treat
bawled
the
Gabbler
not
releasing
the
exhausted
booth-keeper
from
his
embraces
'you
've
given
us
a
treat
there
's
no
denying
You
've
won
brother
you
've
won
I
congratulate
you
the
quart
's
yours
Yashka
's
miles
behind
you
I
tell
you
miles
take
my
word
for
it
And
again
he
hugged
the
booth-keeper
to
his
breast
'There
let
him
alone
let
him
alone
there
's
no
being
rid
of
you
said
the
Blinkard
with
vexation
'let
him
sit
down
on
the
bench
he's
tired
see
You
're
a
ninny
brother
a
perfect
ninny
What
are
you
sticking
to
him
like
a
wet
leaf
for
'Well
then
let
him
sit
down
and
I
'll
drink
to
his
health
said
the
Gabbler
and
he
went
up
to
the
bar
'At
your
expense
brother
he
added
addressing
the
booth-keeper
The
latter
nodded
sat
down
on
the
bench
pulled
a
piece
of
cloth
out
of
his
cap
and
began
wiping
his
face
while
the
Gabbler
with
greedy
haste
emptied
his
glass
and
with
a
grunt
assumed
after
the
manner
of
confirmed
drinkers
an
expression
of
careworn
melancholy
'You
sing
beautifully
brother
beautifully
Nikolai
Ivanitch
observed
caressingly
'And
now
it
's
your
turn
Yasha
mind
now
do
n't
be
afraid
We
shall
see
who
's
who
we
shall
see
The
booth-keeper
sings
beautifully
though
'pon
my
soul
he
does
'Very
beautifully
observed
Nikolai
Ivanitch
's
wife
and
she
looked
with
a
smile
at
Yakov
'Beautifully
ha
repeated
my
neighbour
in
an
undertone
'Ah
a
wild
man
of
the
woods
the
Gabbler
vociferated
suddenly
and
going
up
to
the
peasant
with
the
rent
on
his
shoulder
he
pointed
at
him
with
his
finger
while
he
pranced
about
and
went
off
into
an
insulting
guffaw
'Ha
ha
get
along
wild
man
of
the
woods
Here
's
a
ragamuffin
from
Woodland
village
What
brought
you
here
he
bawled
amidst
laughter
The
poor
peasant
was
abashed
and
was
just
about
to
get
up
and
make
off
as
fast
as
he
could
when
suddenly
the
Wild
Master
's
iron
voice
was
heard
'What
does
the
insufferable
brute
mean
he
articulated
grinding
his
teeth
'I
was
n't
doing
nothing
muttered
the
Gabbler
'I
did
n't
I
only
'There
all
right
shut
up
retorted
the
Wild
Master
'Yakov
begin
Yakov
took
himself
by
his
throat
'Well
really
brothers
something
Hm
I
do
n't
know
on
my
word
what
'Come
that
's
enough
do
n't
be
timid
For
shame
why
go
back
Sing
the
best
you
can
by
God
's
gift
And
the
Wild
Master
looked
down
expectant
Yakov
was
silent
for
a
minute
he
glanced
round
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
All
had
their
eyes
simply
fastened
upon
him
especially
the
booth-keeper
on
whose
face
a
faint
involuntary
uneasiness
could
be
seen
through
his
habitual
expression
of
self-confidence
and
the
triumph
of
his
success
He
leant
back
against
the
wall
and
again
put
both
hands
under
him
but
did
not
swing
his
legs
as
before
When
at
last
Yakov
uncovered
his
face
it
was
pale
as
a
dead
man
's
his
eyes
gleamed
faintly
under
their
drooping
lashes
He
gave
a
deep
sigh
and
began
to
sing
The
first
sound
of
his
voice
was
faint
and
unequal
and
seemed
not
to
come
from
his
chest
but
to
be
wafted
from
somewhere
afar
off
as
though
it
had
floated
by
chance
into
the
room
A
strange
effect
was
produced
on
all
of
us
by
this
trembling
resonant
note
we
glanced
at
one
another
and
Nikolai
Ivanitch
's
wife
seemed
to
draw
herself
up
This
first
note
was
followed
by
another
bolder
and
prolonged
but
still
obviously
quivering
like
a
harpstring
when
suddenly
struck
by
a
stray
finger
it
throbs
in
a
last
swiftly-dying
tremble
the
second
was
followed
by
a
third
and
gradually
gaining
fire
and
breadth
the
strains
swelled
into
a
pathetic
melody
'Not
one
little
path
ran
into
the
field
he
sang
and
sweet
and
mournful
it
was
in
our
ears
I
have
seldom
I
must
confess
heard
a
voice
like
it
it
was
slightly
hoarse
and
not
perfectly
true
there
was
even
something
morbid
about
it
at
first
but
it
had
genuine
depth
of
passion
and
youth
and
sweetness
and
a
sort
of
fascinating
careless
pathetic
melancholy
A
spirit
of
truth
and
fire
a
Russian
spirit
was
sounding
and
breathing
in
that
voice
and
it
seemed
to
go
straight
to
your
heart
to
go
straight
to
all
that
was
Russian
in
it
The
song
swelled
and
flowed
Yakov
was
clearly
carried
away
by
enthusiasm
he
was
not
timid
now
he
surrendered
himself
wholly
to
the
rapture
of
his
art
his
voice
no
longer
trembled
it
quivered
but
with
the
scarce
perceptible
inward
quiver
of
passion
which
pierces
like
an
arrow
to
the
very
soul
of
the
listeners
and
he
steadily
gained
strength
and
firmness
and
breadth
I
remember
I
once
saw
at
sunset
on
a
flat
sandy
shore
when
the
tide
was
low
and
the
sea
's
roar
came
weighty
and
menacing
from
the
distance
a
great
white
sea-gull
it
sat
motionless
its
silky
bosom
facing
the
crimson
glow
of
the
setting
sun
and
only
now
and
then
opening
wide
its
great
wings
to
greet
the
well-known
sea
to
greet
the
sinking
lurid
sun
I
recalled
it
as
I
heard
Yakov
He
sang
utterly
forgetful
of
his
rival
and
all
of
us
he
seemed
supported
as
a
bold
swimmer
by
the
waves
by
our
silent
passionate
sympathy
He
sang
and
in
every
sound
of
his
voice
one
seemed
to
feel
something
dear
and
akin
to
us
something
of
breadth
and
space
as
though
the
familiar
steppes
were
unfolding
before
our
eyes
and
stretching
away
into
endless
distance
I
felt
the
tears
gathering
in
my
bosom
and
rising
to
my
eyes
suddenly
I
was
struck
by
dull
smothered
sobs
I
looked
round
the
innkeeper
's
wife
was
weeping
her
bosom
pressed
close
to
the
window
Yakov
threw
a
quick
glance
at
her
and
he
sang
more
sweetly
more
melodiously
than
ever
Nikolai
Ivanitch
looked
down
the
Blinkard
turned
away
the
Gabbler
quite
touched
stood
his
gaping
mouth
stupidly
open
the
humble
peasant
was
sobbing
softly
in
the
corner
and
shaking
his
head
with
a
plaintive
murmur
and
on
the
iron
visage
of
the
Wild
Master
from
under
his
overhanging
brows
there
slowly
rolled
a
heavy
tear
the
booth-keeper
raised
his
clenched
fist
to
his
brow
and
did
not
stir
I
do
n't
know
how
the
general
emotion
would
have
ended
if
Yakov
had
not
suddenly
come
to
a
full
stop
on
a
high
exceptionally
shrill
note
as
though
his
voice
had
broken
No
one
called
out
or
even
stirred
every
one
seemed
to
be
waiting
to
see
whether
he
was
not
going
to
sing
more
but
he
opened
his
eyes
as
though
wondering
at
our
silence
looked
round
at
all
of
us
with
a
face
of
inquiry
and
saw
that
the
victory
was
his
'Yasha
said
the
Wild
Master
laying
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
he
could
say
no
more
We
all
stood
as
it
were
petrified
The
booth-keeper
softly
rose
and
went
up
to
Yakov
'You
yours
you
've
won
he
articulated
at
last
with
an
effort
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
His
rapid
decided
action
as
it
were
broke
the
spell
we
all
suddenly
fell
into
noisy
delighted
talk
The
Gabbler
bounded
up
and
down
stammered
and
brandished
his
arms
like
mill-sails
the
Blinkard
limped
up
to
Yakov
and
began
kissing
him
Nikolai
Ivanitch
got
up
and
solemnly
announced
that
he
would
add
a
second
pot
of
beer
from
himself
The
Wild
Master
laughed
a
sort
of
kind
simple
laugh
which
I
should
never
have
expected
to
see
on
his
face
the
humble
peasant
as
he
wiped
his
eyes
cheeks
nose
and
beard
on
his
sleeves
kept
repeating
in
his
corner
'Ah
beautiful
it
was
by
God
blast
me
for
the
son
of
a
dog
but
it
was
fine
while
Nikolai
Ivanitch
's
wife
her
face
red
with
weeping
got
up
quickly
and
went
away
Yakov
was
enjoying
his
triumph
like
a
child
his
whole
face
was
tranformed
his
eyes
especially
fairly
glowed
with
happiness
They
dragged
him
to
the
bar
he
beckoned
the
weeping
peasant
up
to
it
and
sent
the
innkeeper's
little
son
to
look
after
the
booth-keeper
who
was
not
found
however
and
the
festivities
began
'You
'll
sing
to
us
again
you
're
going
to
sing
to
us
till
evening
the
Gabbler
declared
flourishing
his
hands
in
the
air
I
took
one
more
look
at
Yakov
and
went
out
I
did
not
want
to
stay
I
was
afraid
of
spoiling
the
impression
I
had
received
But
the
heat
was
as
insupportable
as
before
It
seemed
hanging
in
a
thick
heavy
layer
right
over
the
earth
over
the
dark
blue
sky
tiny
bright
fires
seemed
whisking
through
the
finest
almost
black
dust
Everything
was
still
and
there
was
something
hopeless
and
oppressive
in
this
profound
hush
of
exhausted
nature
I
made
my
way
to
a
hay-loft
and
lay
down
on
the
fresh-cut
but
already
almost
dry
grass
For
a
long
while
I
could
not
go
to
sleep
for
a
long
while
Yakov
's
irresistible
voice
was
ringing
in
my
ears
At
last
the
heat
and
fatigue
regained
their
sway
however
and
I
fell
into
a
dead
sleep
When
I
waked
up
everything
was
in
darkness
