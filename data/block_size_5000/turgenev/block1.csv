turned
the
luckless
girl
out
of
her
house
in
disgrace
and
moved
to
Moscow
where
she
adopted
a
young
lady
of
noble
birth
and
made
her
her
heiress
On
her
return
to
her
own
relations
poor
and
drunken
people
Masha
's
lot
was
a
bitter
one
Tyeglev
had
promised
to
marry
her
and
did
not
keep
his
promise
At
his
last
interview
with
her
he
was
forced
to
speak
out
she
wanted
to
know
the
truth
and
wrung
it
out
of
him
Well
she
said
if
I
am
not
to
be
your
wife
I
know
what
there
is
left
for
me
to
do
More
than
a
fortnight
had
passed
since
that
last
interview
I
never
for
a
moment
deceived
myself
as
to
the
meaning
of
her
last
words
added
Tyeglev
I
am
certain
that
she
has
put
an
end
to
her
life
and
and
that
it
was
her
voice
that
it
was
she
calling
me
to
follow
her
there
I
recognised
her
voice
Well
there
is
but
one
end
to
it
But
why
did
n't
you
marry
her
Ilya
Stepanitch
I
asked
You
ceased
to
love
her
No
I
still
love
her
passionately
At
this
point
I
stared
at
Tyeglev
I
remembered
another
friend
of
mine
a
very
intelligent
man
who
had
a
very
plain
wife
neither
intelligent
nor
rich
and
was
very
unhappy
in
his
marriage
When
someone
in
my
presence
asked
him
why
he
had
married
and
suggested
that
it
was
probably
for
love
he
answered
Not
for
love
at
all
It
simply
happened
And
in
this
case
Tyeglev
loved
a
girl
passionately
and
did
not
marry
her
Was
it
for
the
same
reason
then
Why
do
n't
you
marry
her
then
I
asked
again
Tyeglev
's
strange
drowsy
eyes
strayed
over
the
table
There
is
no
answering
that
in
a
few
words
he
began
hesitating
There
were
reasons
And
besides
she
was
a
working-class
girl
And
then
there
is
my
uncle
I
was
obliged
to
consider
him
too
Your
uncle
I
cried
But
what
the
devil
do
you
want
with
your
uncle
whom
you
never
see
except
at
the
New
Year
when
you
go
to
congratulate
him
Are
you
reckoning
on
his
money
But
he
has
got
a
dozen
children
of
his
own
I
spoke
with
heat
Tyeglev
winced
and
flushed
flushed
unevenly
in
patches
Do
n't
lecture
me
if
you
please
he
said
dully
I
do
n't
justify
myself
however
I
have
ruined
her
life
and
now
I
must
pay
the
penalty
His
head
sank
and
he
was
silent
I
found
nothing
to
say
either
So
we
sat
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
He
looked
away
I
looked
at
him
and
I
noticed
that
the
hair
stood
up
and
curled
above
his
forehead
in
a
peculiar
way
which
so
I
have
heard
from
an
army
doctor
who
had
had
a
great
many
wounded
pass
through
his
hands
is
always
a
symptom
of
intense
overheating
of
the
brain
The
thought
struck
me
again
that
fate
really
had
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
this
man
and
that
his
comrades
were
right
in
seeing
something
fatal
in
him
And
yet
inwardly
I
blamed
him
A
working-class
girl
I
thought
a
fine
sort
of
aristocrat
you
are
yourself
Perhaps
you
blame
me
Ridel
Tyeglev
began
suddenly
as
though
guessing
what
I
was
thinking
I
am
very
unhappy
myself
But
what
to
do
What
to
do
He
leaned
his
chin
on
his
hand
and
began
biting
the
broad
flat
nails
of
his
short
red
fingers
hard
as
iron
What
I
think
Ilya
Stepanitch
is
that
you
ought
first
to
make
certain
whether
your
suppositions
are
correct
Perhaps
your
lady
love
is
alive
and
well
Shall
I
tell
him
the
real
explanation
of
the
taps
flashed
through
my
mind
No
later
She
has
not
written
to
me
since
we
have
been
in
camp
observed
Tyeglev
That
proves
nothing
Ilya
Stepanitch
Tyeglev
waved
me
off
No
she
is
certainly
not
in
this
world
She
called
me
He
suddenly
turned
to
the
window
Someone
is
knocking
again
I
could
not
help
laughing
No
excuse
me
Ilya
Stepanitch
This
time
it
is
your
nerves
You
see
it
is
getting
light
In
ten
minutes
the
sun
will
be
up
it
is
past
three
o'clock
and
ghosts
have
no
power
in
the
day
Tyeglev
cast
a
gloomy
glance
at
me
and
muttering
through
his
teeth
good-bye
lay
down
on
the
bench
and
turned
his
back
on
me
I
lay
down
too
and
before
I
fell
asleep
I
remember
I
wondered
why
Tyeglev
was
always
hinting
at
suicide
What
nonsense
What
humbug
Of
his
own
free
will
he
had
refused
to
marry
her
had
cast
her
off
and
now
he
wanted
to
kill
himself
There
was
no
sense
in
it
He
could
not
resist
posing
With
these
thoughts
I
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
and
when
I
opened
my
eyes
the
sun
was
already
high
in
the
sky
and
Tyeglev
was
not
in
the
hut
He
had
so
his
servant
said
gone
to
the
town
I
spent
a
very
dull
and
wearisome
day
Tyeglev
did
not
return
to
dinner
nor
to
supper
I
did
not
expect
my
brother
Towards
evening
a
thick
fog
came
on
again
thicker
even
than
the
day
before
I
went
to
bed
rather
early
I
was
awakened
by
a
knocking
under
the
window
It
was
my
turn
to
be
startled
The
knock
was
repeated
and
so
insistently
distinct
that
one
could
have
no
doubt
of
its
reality
I
got
up
opened
the
window
and
saw
Tyeglev
Wrapped
in
his
great-coat
with
his
cap
pulled
over
his
eyes
he
stood
motionless
Ilya
Stepanitch
I
cried
is
that
you
I
gave
up
expecting
you
Come
in
Is
the
door
locked
Tyeglev
shook
his
head
I
do
not
intend
to
come
in
he
pronounced
in
a
hollow
tone
I
only
want
to
ask
you
to
give
this
letter
to
the
commanding
officer
to-morrow
He
gave
me
a
big
envelope
sealed
with
five
seals
I
was
astonished
however
I
took
the
envelope
mechanically
Tyeglev
at
once
walked
away
into
the
middle
of
the
road
Stop
stop
I
began
Where
are
you
going
Have
you
only
just
come
And
what
is
the
letter
Do
you
promise
to
deliver
it
said
Tyeglev
and
moved
away
a
few
steps
further
The
fog
blurred
the
outlines
of
his
figure
Do
you
promise
I
promise
but
first
Tyeglev
moved
still
further
away
and
became
a
long
dark
blur
Good-bye
I
heard
his
voice
Farewell
Ridel
do
n't
remember
evil
against
me
And
do
n't
forget
Semyon
And
the
blur
itself
vanished
This
was
too
much
Oh
the
damned
poseur
I
thought
You
must
always
be
straining
after
effect
I
felt
uneasy
however
an
involuntary
fear
clutched
at
my
heart
I
flung
on
my
great-coat
and
ran
out
into
the
road
Yes
but
where
was
I
to
go
The
fog
enveloped
me
on
all
sides
For
five
or
six
steps
all
round
it
was
a
little
transparent
but
further
away
it
stood
up
like
a
wall
thick
and
white
like
cotton
wool
I
turned
to
the
right
along
the
village
street
our
house
was
the
last
but
one
in
the
village
and
beyond
it
came
waste
land
overgrown
here
and
there
with
bushes
beyond
the
waste
land
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
village
there
was
a
birch
copse
through
which
flowed
the
same
little
stream
that
lower
down
encircled
our
village
The
moon
stood
a
pale
blur
in
the
sky
but
its
light
was
not
as
on
the
evening
before
strong
enough
to
penetrate
the
smoky
density
of
the
fog
and
hung
a
broad
opaque
canopy
overhead
I
made
my
way
out
on
to
the
open
ground
and
listened
Not
a
sound
from
any
direction
except
the
calling
of
the
marsh
birds
Tyeglev
I
cried
Ilya
Stepanitch
Tyeglev
My
voice
died
away
near
me
without
an
answer
it
seemed
as
though
the
fog
would
not
let
it
go
further
Tyeglev
I
repeated
No
one
answered
I
went
forward
at
random
Twice
I
struck
against
a
fence
once
I
nearly
fell
into
a
ditch
and
almost
stumbled
against
a
peasant's
horse
lying
on
the
ground
Tyeglev
Tyeglev
I
cried
All
at
once
almost
behind
me
I
heard
a
low
voice
Well
here
I
am
What
do
you
want
of
me
I
turned
round
quickly
Before
me
stood
Tyeglev
with
his
hands
hanging
at
his
sides
and
with
no
cap
on
his
head
His
face
was
pale
but
his
eyes
looked
animated
and
bigger
than
usual
His
breathing
came
in
deep
prolonged
gasps
through
his
parted
lips
Thank
God
I
cried
in
an
outburst
of
joy
and
I
gripped
him
by
both
hands
Thank
God
I
was
beginning
to
despair
of
finding
you
Aren't
you
ashamed
of
frightening
me
like
this
Upon
my
word
Ilya
Stepanitch
What
do
you
want
of
me
repeated
Tyeglev
I
want
I
want
you
in
the
first
place
to
come
back
home
with
me
And
secondly
I
want
I
insist
I
insist
as
a
friend
that
you
explain
to
me
at
once
the
meaning
of
your
actions
and
of
this
letter
to
the
colonel
Can
something
unexpected
have
happened
to
you
in
Petersburg
I
found
in
Petersburg
exactly
what
I
expected
answered
Tyeglev
without
moving
from
the
spot
That
is
you
mean
to
say
your
friend
this
Masha
She
has
taken
her
life
Tyeglev
answered
hurriedly
and
as
it
were
angrily
She
was
buried
the
day
before
yesterday
She
did
not
even
leave
a
note
for
me
She
poisoned
herself
Tyeglev
hurriedly
uttered
these
terrible
words
and
still
stood
motionless
as
a
stone
I
clasped
my
hands
Is
it
possible
How
dreadful
Your
presentiment
has
come
true
That
is
awful
I
stopped
in
confusion
Slowly
and
with
a
sort
of
triumph
Tyeglev
folded
his
arms
But
why
are
we
standing
here
I
began
Let
us
go
home
Let
us
said
Tyeglev
But
how
can
we
find
the
way
in
this
fog
There
is
a
light
in
our
windows
and
we
will
make
for
it
Come
along
You
go
ahead
answered
Tyeglev
I
will
follow
you
We
set
off
We
walked
for
five
minutes
and
our
beacon
light
still
did
not
appear
at
last
it
gleamed
before
us
in
two
red
points
Tyeglev
stepped
evenly
behind
me
I
was
desperately
anxious
to
get
home
as
quickly
as
possible
and
to
learn
from
him
all
the
details
of
his
unhappy
expedition
to
Petersburg
Before
we
reached
the
hut
impressed
by
what
he
had
said
I
confessed
to
him
in
an
access
of
remorse
and
a
sort
of
superstitious
fear
that
the
mysterious
knocking
of
the
previous
evening
had
been
my
doing
and
what
a
tragic
turn
my
jest
had
taken
Tyeglev
confined
himself
to
observing
that
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
something
else
had
guided
my
hand
and
this
only
showed
how
little
I
knew
him
His
voice
strangely
calm
and
even
sounded
close
to
my
ear
But
you
do
not
know
me
he
added
I
saw
you
smile
yesterday
when
I
spoke
of
the
strength
of
my
will
You
will
come
to
know
me
and
you
will
remember
my
words
The
first
hut
of
the
village
sprang
out
of
the
fog
before
us
like
some
dark
monster
then
the
second
our
hut
emerged
and
my
setter
dog
began
barking
probably
scenting
me
I
knocked
at
the
window
Semyon
I
shouted
to
Tyeglev
's
servant
hey
Semyon
Make
haste
and
open
the
gate
for
us
The
gate
creaked
and
opened
Semyon
crossed
the
threshold
Ilya
Stepanitch
come
in
I
said
and
I
looked
round
But
no
Ilya
Stepanitch
was
with
me
Tyeglev
had
vanished
as
though
he
had
sunk
into
the
earth
I
went
into
the
hut
feeling
dazed
Vexation
with
Tyeglev
and
with
myself
succeeded
the
amazement
with
which
I
was
overcome
at
first
Your
master
is
mad
I
blurted
out
to
Semyon
raving
mad
He
galloped
off
to
Petersburg
then
came
back
and
is
running
about
all
over
the
place
I
did
get
hold
of
him
and
brought
him
right
up
to
the
gate
and
here
he
has
given
me
the
slip
again
To
go
out
of
doors
on
a
night
like
this
He
has
chosen
a
nice
time
for
a
walk
And
why
did
I
let
go
of
his
hand
I
reproached
myself
Semyon
looked
at
me
in
silence
as
though
intending
to
say
something
but
after
the
fashion
of
servants
in
those
days
he
simply
shifted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
said
nothing
What
time
did
he
set
off
for
town
I
asked
sternly
At
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
And
how
was
he
did
he
seem
anxious
depressed
Semyon
looked
down
Our
master
is
a
deep
one
he
began
Who
can
make
him
out
He
told
me
to
get
out
his
new
uniform
when
he
was
going
out
to
town
and
then
he
curled
himself
Curled
himself
Curled
his
hair
I
got
the
curling
tongs
ready
for
him
That
I
confess
I
had
not
expected
Do
you
know
a
young
lady
I
asked
Semyon
a
friend
of
Ilya
Stepanitch
's
Her
name
is
Masha
To
be
sure
I
know
Marya
Anempodistovna
A
nice
young
lady
Is
your
master
in
love
with
this
Marya
et
cetera
Semyon
heaved
a
sigh
That
young
lady
is
Ilya
Stepanitch
's
undoing
For
he
is
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
ca
n't
bring
himself
to
marry
her
and
sorry
to
give
her
up
too
It
's
all
his
honour's
faintheartedness
He
is
very
fond
of
her
What
is
she
like
then
pretty
I
inquired
Semyon
assumed
a
grave
air
She
is
the
sort
that
the
gentry
like
And
you
She
is
not
the
right
sort
for
us
at
all
How
so
Very
thin
in
the
body
If
she
died
I
began
do
you
think
Ilya
Stepanitch
would
not
survive
her
Semyon
heaved
a
sigh
again
I
ca
n't
venture
to
say
that
there
's
no
knowing
with
gentlemen
but
our
master
is
a
deep
one
I
took
up
from
the
table
the
big
rather
thick
letter
that
Tyeglev
had
given
me
and
turned
it
over
in
my
hands
The
address
to
his
honour
the
Commanding
Officer
of
the
Battery
Colonel
So
and
So
the
name
patronymic
and
surname
was
clearly
and
distinctly
written
The
word
urgent
twice
underlined
was
written
in
the
top
left-hand
corner
of
the
envelope
Listen
Semyon
I
began
I
feel
uneasy
about
your
master
I
fancy
he
has
some
mischief
in
his
mind
We
must
find
him
Yes
sir
answered
Semyon
It
is
true
there
is
such
a
fog
that
one
can
not
see
a
couple
of
yards
ahead
but
all
the
same
we
must
do
our
best
We
will
each
take
a
lantern
and
light
a
candle
in
each
window
in
case
of
need
Yes
sir
repeated
Semyon
He
lighted
the
lanterns
and
the
candles
and
we
set
off
I
ca
n't
describe
how
we
wandered
and
lost
our
way
The
lanterns
were
of
no
help
to
us
they
did
not
in
the
least
dissipate
the
white
almost
luminous
mist
which
surrounded
us
Several
times
Semyon
and
I
lost
each
other
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
kept
calling
to
each
other
and
hallooing
and
at
frequent
intervals
shouted
I
Tyeglev
Ilya
Stepanitch
and
Semyon
Mr
Tyeglev
Your
honour
The
fog
so
bewildered
us
that
we
wandered
about
as
though
in
a
dream
soon
we
were
both
hoarse
the
fog
penetrated
right
into
one
's
chest
We
succeeded
somehow
by
help
of
the
candles
in
the
windows
in
reaching
the
hut
again
Our
combined
action
had
been
of
no
use
we
merely
handicapped
each
other
and
so
we
made
up
our
minds
not
to
trouble
ourselves
about
getting
separated
but
to
go
each
our
own
way
He
went
to
the
left
I
to
the
right
and
I
soon
ceased
to
hear
his
voice
The
fog
seemed
to
have
found
its
way
into
my
brain
and
I
wandered
like
one
dazed
simply
shouting
from
time
to
time
Tyeglev
Tyeglev
Here
I
heard
suddenly
in
answer
Holy
saints
how
relieved
I
was
How
I
rushed
in
the
direction
from
which
the
voice
came
A
human
figure
loomed
dark
before
me
I
made
for
it
At
last
But
instead
of
Tyeglev
I
saw
another
officer
of
the
same
battery
whose
name
was
Tyelepnev
Was
it
you
answered
me
I
asked
him
Was
it
you
calling
me
he
asked
in
his
turn
No
I
was
calling
Tyeglev
Tyeglev
Why
I
met
him
a
minute
ago
What
a
fool
of
a
night
One
ca
n't
find
the
way
home
You
saw
Tyeglev
Which
way
did
he
go
That
way
I
fancy
said
the
officer
waving
his
hand
in
the
air
But
one
ca
n't
be
sure
of
anything
now
Do
you
know
for
instance
where
the
village
is
The
only
hope
is
the
dogs
barking
It
is
a
fool
of
a
night
Let
me
light
a
cigarette
it
will
seem
like
a
light
on
the
way
The
officer
was
so
I
fancied
a
little
exhilarated
Did
Tyeglev
say
anything
to
you
I
asked
To
be
sure
he
did
I
said
to
him
'good
evening
brother
and
he
said
'good-bye
'How
good-bye
Why
good-bye
'I
mean
to
shoot
myself
directly
with
a
pistol
He
is
a
queer
fish
My
heart
stood
still
You
say
he
told
you
He
is
a
queer
fish
repeated
the
officer
and
sauntered
off
I
hardly
had
time
to
recover
from
what
the
officer
had
told
me
when
my
own
name
shouted
several
times
as
it
seemed
with
effort
caught
my
ear
I
recognised
Semyon
's
voice
I
called
back
he
came
to
me
Well
I
asked
him
Have
you
found
Ilya
Stepanitch
Yes
sir
Where
Here
not
far
away
How
have
you
found
him
Is
he
alive
To
be
sure
I
have
been
talking
to
him
A
load
was
lifted
from
my
heart
His
honour
was
sitting
in
his
great-coat
under
a
birch
tree
and
he
was
all
right
I
put
it
to
him
'Wo
n't
you
come
home
Ilya
Stepanitch
Alexandr
Vassilitch
is
very
much
worried
about
you
And
he
said
to
me
'What
does
he
want
to
worry
for
I
want
to
be
in
the
fresh
air
My
head
aches
Go
home
he
said
'and
I
will
come
later
And
you
left
him
I
cried
clasping
my
hands
What
else
could
I
do
He
told
me
to
go
how
could
I
stay
All
my
fears
came
back
to
me
at
once
Take
me
to
him
this
minute
do
you
hear
This
minute
O
Semyon
Semyon
I
did
not
expect
this
of
you
You
say
he
is
not
far
off
He
is
quite
close
here
where
the
copse
begins
he
is
sitting
there
It
is
not
more
than
five
yards
from
the
river
bank
I
found
him
as
I
came
alongside
the
river
Well
take
me
to
him
take
me
to
him
Semyon
set
off
ahead
of
me
This
way
sir
We
have
only
to
get
down
to
the
river
and
it
is
close
there
But
instead
of
getting
down
to
the
river
we
got
into
a
hollow
and
found
ourselves
before
an
empty
shed
Hey
stop
Semyon
cried
suddenly
I
must
have
come
too
far
to
the
right
We
must
go
that
way
more
to
the
left
We
turned
to
the
left
and
found
ourselves
among
such
high
rank
weeds
that
we
could
scarcely
get
out
I
could
not
remember
such
a
tangled
growth
of
weeds
anywhere
near
our
village
And
then
all
at
once
a
marsh
was
squelching
under
our
feet
and
we
saw
little
round
moss-covered
hillocks
which
I
had
never
noticed
before
either
We
turned
back
a
small
hill
was
sharply
before
us
and
on
the
top
of
it
stood
a
shanty
and
in
it
someone
was
snoring
Semyon
and
I
shouted
several
times
into
the
shanty
something
stirred
at
the
further
end
of
it
the
straw
rustled
and
a
hoarse
voice
shouted
I
am
on
guard
We
turned
back
again
fields
and
fields
endless
fields
I
felt
ready
to
cry
I
remembered
the
words
of
the
fool
in
King
Lear
This
night
will
turn
us
all
to
fools
or
madmen
Where
are
we
to
go
I
said
in
despair
to
Semyon
The
devil
must
have
led
us
astray
sir
answered
the
distracted
servant
It
's
not
natural
there
's
mischief
at
the
bottom
of
it
I
would
have
checked
him
but
at
that
instant
my
ear
caught
a
sound
distinct
but
not
loud
that
engrossed
my
whole
attention
There
was
a
faint
pop
as
though
someone
had
drawn
a
stiff
cork
from
a
narrow
bottle-neck
The
sound
came
from
somewhere
not
far
off
Why
the
sound
seemed
to
me
strange
and
peculiar
I
could
not
say
but
at
once
I
went
towards
it
Semyon
followed
me
Within
a
few
minutes
something
tall
and
broad
loomed
in
the
fog
The
copse
here
is
the
copse
Semyon
cried
delighted
Yes
here
and
there
is
the
master
sitting
under
the
birch-tree
There
he
is
sitting
where
I
left
him
That
's
he
surely
enough
I
looked
intently
A
man
really
was
sitting
with
his
back
towards
us
awkwardly
huddled
up
under
the
birch-tree
I
hurriedly
approached
and
recognised
Tyeglev
's
great-coat
recognised
his
figure
his
head
bowed
on
his
breast
Tyeglev
I
cried
but
he
did
not
answer
Tyeglev
I
repeated
and
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
Then
he
suddenly
lurched
forward
quickly
and
obediently
as
though
he
were
waiting
for
my
touch
and
fell
onto
the
grass
Semyon
and
I
raised
him
at
once
and
turned
him
face
upwards
It
was
not
pale
but
was
lifeless
and
motionless
his
clenched
teeth
gleamed
white
and
his
eyes
motionless
too
and
wide
open
kept
their
habitual
drowsy
and
different
look
Good
God
Semyon
said
suddenly
and
showed
me
his
hand
stained
crimson
with
blood
The
blood
was
coming
from
under
Tyeglev's
great-coat
from
the
left
side
of
his
chest
He
had
shot
himself
from
a
small
single-barreled
pistol
which
was
lying
beside
him
The
faint
pop
I
had
heard
was
the
sound
made
by
the
fatal
shot
Tyeglev
's
suicide
did
not
surprise
his
comrades
very
much
I
have
told
you
already
that
according
to
their
ideas
as
a
fatal
man
he
was
bound
to
do
something
extraordinary
though
perhaps
they
had
not
expected
that
from
him
In
the
letter
to
the
colonel
he
asked
him
in
the
first
place
to
have
the
name
of
Ilya
Tyeglev
removed
from
the
list
of
officers
as
he
had
died
by
his
own
act
adding
that
in
his
cash-box
there
would
be
found
more
than
sufficient
money
to
pay
his
debts
and
secondly
to
forward
to
the
important
personage
at
that
time
commanding
the
whole
corps
of
guards
an
unsealed
letter
which
was
in
the
same
envelope
This
second
letter
of
course
we
all
read
some
of
us
took
a
copy
of
it
Tyeglev
had
evidently
taken
pains
over
the
composition
of
this
letter
You
know
Your
Excellency
so
I
remember
the
letter
began
you
are
so
stern
and
severe
over
the
slightest
negligence
in
uniform
when
a
pale
trembling
officer
presents
himself
before
you
and
here
am
I
now
going
to
meet
our
universal
righteous
incorruptible
Judge
the
Supreme
Being
the
Being
of
infinitely
greater
consequence
even
than
Your
Excellency
and
I
am
going
to
meet
him
in
undress
in
my
great-coat
and
even
without
a
cravat
round
my
neck
Oh
what
a
painful
and
unpleasant
impression
that
phrase
made
upon
me
with
every
word
every
letter
of
it
carefully
written
in
the
dead
man
's
childish
handwriting
Was
it
worth
while
I
asked
myself
to
invent
such
rubbish
at
such
a
moment
But
Tyeglev
had
evidently
been
pleased
with
the
phrase
he
had
made
use
in
it
of
the
accumulation
of
epithets
and
amplifications
la
Marlinsky
at
that
time
in
fashion
Further
on
he
had
alluded
to
destiny
to
persecution
to
his
vocation
which
had
remained
unfulfilled
to
a
mystery
which
he
would
bear
with
him
to
the
grave
to
people
who
had
not
cared
to
understand
him
he
had
even
quoted
lines
from
some
poet
who
had
said
of
the
crowd
that
it
wore
life
like
a
dog-collar
and
clung
to
vice
like
a
burdock
and
it
was
not
free
from
mistakes
in
spelling
To
tell
the
truth
this
last
letter
of
poor
Tyeglev
was
somewhat
vulgar
and
I
can
fancy
the
contemptuous
surprise
of
the
great
personage
to
whom
it
was
addressed
I
can
imagine
the
tone
in
which
he
would
pronounce
a
worthless
officer
ill
weeds
are
cleared
out
of
the
field
Only
at
the
very
end
of
the
letter
there
was
a
sincere
note
from
Tyeglev
's
heart
Ah
Your
Excellency
he
concluded
his
epistle
I
am
an
orphan
I
had
no
one
to
love
me
as
a
child
and
all
held
aloof
from
me
and
I
myself
destroyed
the
only
heart
that
gave
itself
to
me
Semyon
found
in
the
pocket
of
Tyeglev
's
great-coat
a
little
album
from
which
his
master
was
never
separated
But
almost
all
the
pages
had
been
torn
out
only
one
was
left

there
was

Poor
fellow
Was
not
this
perhaps
why
he
became
an
artillery
officer
As
a
suicide
he
was
buried
outside
the
cemetery
and
he
was
immediately
forgotten
The
day
after
Tyeglev
's
burial
I
was
still
in
the
village
waiting
for
my
brother
Semyon
came
into
the
hut
and
announced
that
Ilya
wanted
to
see
me
What
Ilya
I
asked
Our
pedlar
I
told
Semyon
to
call
him
He
made
his
appearance
He
expressed
some
regret
at
the
death
of
the
lieutenant
wondered
what
could
have
possessed
him
Was
he
in
debt
to
you
I
asked
No
sir
He
always
paid
punctually
for
everything
he
had
But
I
tell
you
what
here
the
pedlar
grinned
you
have
got
something
of
mine
What
is
it
Why
that
he
pointed
to
the
brass
comb
lying
on
the
little
toilet
table
A
thing
of
little
value
the
fellow
went
on
but
as
it
was
a
present
All
at
once
I
raised
my
head
Something
dawned
upon
me
Your
name
is
Ilya
Yes
sir
Was
it
you
then
I
saw
under
the
willow
tree
the
other
night
The
pedlar
winked
and
grinned
more
broadly
than
ever
Yes
sir
And
it
was
your
name
that
was
called
Yes
sir
the
pedlar
repeated
with
playful
modesty
There
is
a
young
girl
here
he
went
on
in
a
high
falsetto
who
owing
to
the
great
strictness
of
her
parents
Very
good
very
good
I
interrupted
him
handed
him
the
comb
and
dismissed
him
So
that
was
the
'Ilyusha
I
thought
and
I
sank
into
philosophic
reflections
which
I
will
not
however
intrude
upon
you
as
I
don't
want
to
prevent
anyone
from
believing
in
fate
predestination
and
such
like
When
I
was
back
in
Petersburg
I
made
inquiries
about
Masha
I
even
discovered
the
doctor
who
had
treated
her
To
my
amazement
I
heard
from
him
that
she
had
died
not
through
poisoning
but
of
cholera
I
told
him
what
I
had
heard
from
Tyeglev
Eh
Eh
cried
the
doctor
all
at
once
Is
that
Tyeglev
an
artillery
officer
a
man
of
middle
height
and
with
a
stoop
speaks
with
a
lisp
Yes
Well
I
thought
so
That
gentleman
came
to
me
I
had
never
seen
him
before
and
began
insisting
that
the
girl
had
poisoned
herself
'It
was
cholera
I
told
him
'Poison
he
said
'It
was
cholera
I
tell
you
I
said
'No
it
was
poison
he
declared
I
saw
that
the
fellow
was
a
sort
of
lunatic
with
a
broad
base
to
his
head
a
sign
of
obstinacy
he
would
not
give
over
easily
Well
it
does
n't
matter
I
thought
the
patient
is
dead
'Very
well
I
said
'she
poisoned
herself
if
you
prefer
it
He
thanked
me
even
shook
hands
with
me
and
departed
I
told
the
doctor
how
the
officer
had
shot
himself
the
same
day
The
doctor
did
not
turn
a
hair
and
only
observed
that
there
were
all
sorts
of
queer
fellows
in
the
world
There
are
indeed
I
assented
Yes
someone
has
said
truly
of
suicides
until
they
carry
out
their
design
no
one
believes
them
and
when
they
do
no
one
regrets
them

THE
INN
On
the
high
road
to
B
at
an
equal
distance
from
the
two
towns
through
which
it
runs
there
stood
not
long
ago
a
roomy
inn
very
well
known
to
the
drivers
of
troikas
peasants
with
trains
of
waggons
merchants
clerks
pedlars
and
the
numerous
travellers
of
all
sorts
who
journey
upon
our
roads
at
all
times
of
the
year
Everyone
used
to
call
at
the
inn
only
perhaps
a
landowner
's
coach
drawn
by
six
home-bred
horses
would
roll
majestically
by
which
did
not
prevent
either
the
coachman
or
the
groom
on
the
footboard
from
looking
with
peculiar
feeling
and
attention
at
the
little
porch
so
familiar
to
them
or
some
poor
devil
in
a
wretched
little
cart
and
with
three
five-kopeck
pieces
in
the
bag
in
his
bosom
would
urge
on
his
weary
nag
when
he
reached
the
prosperous
inn
and
would
hasten
on
to
some
night
's
lodging
in
the
hamlets
that
lie
by
the
