white
brow
rather
thick
nose
and
wide
straight
lips
seemed
breathing
with
the
wild
health
of
the
steppes
with
vigorous
primaeval
energy
He
was
splendidly
well-built
and
his
fair
curly
hair
stood
up
on
his
head
like
a
boy
s
It
was
only
in
his
blue
eyes
with
their
overhanging
brows
and
somewhat
fixed
look
that
one
could
trace
an
expression
not
exactly
of
melancholy
nor
exactly
of
weariness
and
his
voice
had
almost
too
measured
a
cadence
Panshin
meanwhile
continued
to
keep
up
the
conversation
He
turned
it
upon
the
profits
of
sugar-boiling
on
which
he
had
lately
read
two
French
pamphlets
and
with
modest
composure
undertook
to
expound
their
contents
without
mentioning
however
a
single
word
about
the
source
of
his
information
Good
God
it
is
Fedya
came
through
the
half-opened
door
the
voice
of
Marfa
Timofyevna
in
the
next
room
Fedya
himself
and
the
old
woman
ran
hurriedly
into
the
room
Lavretsky
had
not
time
to
get
up
from
his
seat
before
she
had
him
in
her
arms
Let
me
have
a
look
at
you
she
said
holding
his
face
off
at
arm
s
length
Ah
what
a
splendid
fellow
you
are
You
ve
grown
older
a
little
but
not
a
bit
changed
for
the
worse
upon
my
word
But
why
are
you
kissing
my
hands
kiss
my
face
if
you
re
not
afraid
of
my
wrinkled
cheeks
You
never
asked
after
me
whether
your
aunt
was
alive
I
warrant
and
you
were
in
my
arms
as
soon
as
you
were
born
you
great
rascal
Well
that
is
nothing
to
you
I
suppose
why
should
you
remember
me
But
it
was
a
good
idea
of
yours
to
come
back
And
pray
she
added
turning
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
have
you
offered
him
something
to
eat
I
don
t
want
anything
Lavretsky
hastened
to
declare
Come
you
must
at
least
have
some
tea
my
dear
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
He
has
come
from
I
don
t
know
where
and
they
don
t
even
give
him
a
cup
of
tea
Lisa
run
and
stir
them
up
and
make
haste
I
remember
he
was
dreadfully
greedy
when
he
was
a
little
fellow
and
he
likes
good
things
now
I
daresay
My
respects
Marfa
Timofyevna
said
Panshin
approaching
the
delighted
old
lady
from
one
side
with
a
low
bow
Pardon
me
sir
replied
Marfa
Timofyevna
for
not
observing
you
in
my
delight
You
have
grown
like
your
mother
the
poor
darling
she
went
on
turning
again
to
Lavretsky
but
your
nose
was
always
your
father
s
and
your
father
s
it
has
remained
Well
and
are
you
going
to
be
with
us
for
long
I
am
going
to-morrow
aunt
Where
Home
to
Vassilyevskoe
To-morrow
Yes
to-morrow
Well
if
to-morrow
it
must
be
God
bless
you
you
know
best
Only
mind
you
come
and
say
good-bye
to
me
The
old
woman
patted
his
cheek
I
did
not
think
I
should
be
here
to
see
you
not
that
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
die
yet
a
while
I
shall
last
another
ten
years
I
daresay
all
we
Pestovs
live
long
your
late
grandfather
used
to
say
we
had
two
lives
but
you
see
there
was
no
telling
how
much
longer
you
were
going
to
dangle
about
abroad
Well
you
re
a
fine
lad
a
fine
lad
can
you
lift
twenty
stone
with
one
hand
as
you
used
to
do
eh
Your
late
pap
was
fantastical
in
some
things
if
I
may
say
so
but
he
did
well
in
having
that
Swiss
to
bring
you
up
do
you
remember
you
used
to
fight
with
your
fists
with
him
gymnastics
wasn
t
it
they
called
it
But
there
why
I
am
gabbling
away
like
this
I
have
only
been
hindering
Mr
PanSHIN
she
never
pronounced
his
name
PANshin
as
was
correct
from
holding
forth
Besides
we
d
better
go
and
have
tea
yes
let
s
go
on
to
the
terrace
my
boy
and
drink
it
there
we
have
some
real
cream
not
like
what
you
get
in
your
Londons
and
Parises
Come
along
come
along
and
you
Fedusha
give
me
your
arm
Oh
but
what
an
arm
it
is
Upon
my
word
no
fear
of
my
stumbling
with
you
Every
one
got
up
and
went
out
on
to
the
terrace
except
Gedeonovsky
who
quietly
took
his
departure
During
the
whole
of
Lavretsky
s
conversation
with
Marya
Dmitrievna
Panshin
and
Marfa
Timofyevna
he
sat
in
a
corner
blinking
attentively
with
an
open
mouth
of
childish
curiosity
now
he
was
in
haste
to
spread
the
news
of
the
new
arrival
through
the
town
At
eleven
o
clock
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
this
is
what
was
happening
in
Madame
Kalitin
s
house
Downstairs
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
seizing
a
favourable
moment
was
taking
leave
of
Lisa
at
the
drawing-room
door
and
saying
to
her
as
he
held
her
hand
You
know
who
it
is
draws
me
here
you
know
why
I
am
constantly
coming
to
your
house
what
need
of
words
when
all
is
clear
as
it
is
Lisa
did
not
speak
and
looked
on
the
ground
without
smiling
with
her
brows
slightly
contracted
and
a
flush
on
her
cheek
but
she
did
not
draw
away
her
hands
While
up-stairs
in
Marfa
Timofyevna
s
room
by
the
light
of
a
little
lamp
hanging
before
the
tarnished
old
holy
images
Lavretsky
was
sitting
in
a
low
chair
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
the
old
woamn
standing
before
him
now
and
then
silently
stroked
his
hair
He
spent
more
than
an
hour
with
her
after
taking
leave
of
his
hostess
he
had
scarcely
said
anything
to
his
kind
old
friend
and
she
did
not
question
him
Indeed
what
need
to
speak
what
was
there
to
ask
Without
that
she
understood
all
and
felt
for
everything
of
which
his
heart
was
full
Fedor
Ivanitch
Lavretsky
we
must
ask
the
reader
s
permission
to
break
off
the
thread
of
our
story
for
a
time
came
of
an
old
noble
family
The
founder
of
the
house
of
Lavretskky
came
over
from
Prussia
in
the
reign
of
Vassili
the
Blind
and
received
a
grant
of
two
hundred
chetverts
of
land
in
Byezhetsk
Many
of
his
descendants
filled
various
offices
and
served
under
princes
and
persons
of
eminence
in
outlying
districts
but
not
one
of
them
rose
above
the
rank
of
an
inspector
of
the
Imperial
table
nor
acquired
any
considerable
fortune
The
richest
and
most
distinguished
of
all
the
Lavretskys
was
Fedor
Ivanitch
s
great-grandfather
Andrei
a
man
cruel
and
daring
cunning
and
able
Even
to
this
day
stories
still
linger
of
his
tyranny
his
savage
temper
his
reckless
munificence
and
his
insatiable
avarice
He
was
very
stout
and
tall
swarthy
of
countenance
and
beardless
he
spoke
in
a
thick
voice
and
seemed
half
asleep
but
the
more
quietly
he
spoke
the
more
those
about
him
trembled
He
had
managed
to
get
a
wife
who
was
a
fit
match
for
him
She
was
a
gipsy
by
birth
goggle-eyed
and
hook-nosed
with
a
round
yellow
face
She
was
irascible
and
vindictive
and
never
gave
way
in
anything
to
her
husband
who
almost
killed
her
and
whose
death
she
did
not
survive
though
she
had
been
for
ever
quarrelling
with
him
The
son
of
Andrei
Piotr
Fedor
s
grandfather
did
not
take
after
his
father
he
was
a
typical
landowner
of
the
steppes
rather
a
simpleton
loud-voiced
but
slow
to
move
coarse
but
not
ill-natured
hospitable
and
very
fond
of
coursing
with
dogs
He
was
over
thirty
when
he
inherited
from
his
father
a
property
of
two
thousand
serfs
in
capital
condition
but
he
had
soon
dissipated
it
and
had
partly
mortgaged
his
estate
and
demoralised
his
servants
All
sorts
of
people
of
low
position
known
and
unknown
came
crawling
like
cockroaches
from
all
parts
into
his
spacious
warm
ill-kept
halls
All
this
mass
of
people
ate
what
they
could
get
but
always
had
their
fill
drank
till
they
were
drunk
and
carried
off
what
they
could
praising
and
blessing
their
genial
host
and
their
host
too
when
he
was
out
humour
blessed
his
guests
for
a
pack
of
sponging
toadies
but
he
was
bored
when
he
was
without
them
Piotr
Andreitch
s
wife
was
a
meek-spirited
creature
he
had
taken
her
from
a
neighbouring
family
by
his
father
s
choice
and
command
her
name
was
Anna
Pavlovna
She
never
interfered
in
anything
welcomed
guests
cordially
and
readily
paid
visits
herself
though
being
powdered
she
used
to
declare
would
be
the
death
of
her
They
put
she
used
to
say
in
her
old
age
a
fox
s
brush
on
your
head
comb
all
the
hair
up
over
it
smear
it
with
grease
and
dust
it
over
with
flour
and
stick
it
up
with
iron
pins
there
s
no
washing
it
off
afterwards
but
to
pay
visits
without
powder
was
quite
impossible
people
would
be
offended
Ah
it
was
a
torture
She
liked
being
driven
with
fast-trotting
horses
and
was
ready
to
play
cards
from
morning
till
evening
and
would
always
keep
the
score
of
the
pennies
she
had
lost
or
won
hidden
under
her
hand
when
her
husband
came
near
the
card-table
but
all
her
dowry
her
whole
fortune
she
had
put
absolutely
at
his
disposal
She
bore
him
two
children
a
son
Ivan
the
father
of
Fedor
and
a
daughter
Glafira
Ivan
was
not
brought
up
at
home
but
lived
with
a
rich
old
maiden
aunt
the
Princess
Kubensky
she
had
fixed
on
him
for
her
heir
but
for
that
his
father
would
not
have
let
him
go
She
dressed
him
up
like
a
doll
engaged
all
kinds
of
teachers
for
him
and
put
him
in
charge
of
a
tutor
a
Frenchman
who
had
been
an
abbe
a
pupil
of
Jean-Jacques
Rousseau
a
certain
M
Courtin
de
Vaucelles
a
subtle
and
wily
intriguer
the
very
as
she
expressed
it
fine
fleur
of
emigration
and
finished
at
almost
seventy
years
old
by
marrying
this
fine
fleur
and
making
over
all
her
property
to
him
Soon
afterwards
covered
with
rouge
and
redolent
of
perfume
a
la
Richelieu
surrounded
by
negro
boys
delicate-shaped
greyhounds
and
shrieking
parrots
she
died
on
a
crooked
silken
divan
of
the
time
of
Louis
XV
with
an
enamelled
snuff-box
of
Petitot
s
workmanship
in
her
hand
and
died
deserted
by
her
husband
the
insinuating
M
Courtin
had
preferred
to
remove
to
Paris
with
her
money
Ivan
had
only
reached
his
twentieth
year
when
this
unexpected
blow
we
mean
the
princess
s
marriage
not
her
death
fell
upon
him
he
did
not
care
to
stay
in
his
aunt
s
house
where
he
found
himself
suddenly
transformed
from
a
wealthy
heir
to
a
poor
relation
the
society
in
Petersburg
in
which
he
had
grown
up
was
closed
to
him
he
felt
an
aversion
for
entering
the
government
service
in
the
lower
grades
with
nothing
but
hard
work
and
obscurity
before
him
this
was
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
reign
of
the
Emperor
Alexander
He
was
obliged
reluctantly
to
return
to
the
country
to
his
father
How
squalid
poor
and
wretched
his
parents
home
seemed
to
him
The
stagnation
and
sordidness
of
life
in
the
country
offended
him
at
every
step
He
was
consumed
with
ennui
Moreover
every
one
in
the
house
except
his
mother
looked
at
him
with
unfriendly
eyes
His
father
did
not
like
his
town
manners
his
swallow-tail
coats
his
frilled
shirt-fronts
his
books
his
flute
his
fastidious
ways
in
which
he
detected
not
incorrectly
a
disgust
for
his
surroundings
he
was
for
ever
complaining
and
grumbling
at
his
son
Nothing
here
he
used
to
say
is
to
his
taste
at
table
he
is
all
in
a
fret
and
doesn
t
eat
he
can
t
bear
the
heat
and
close
smell
of
the
room
the
sight
of
folks
drunk
upsets
him
one
daren
t
beat
any
one
before
him
he
doesn
t
want
to
go
into
the
government
service
he
s
weakly
as
you
see
in
health
fie
upon
him
the
milksop
And
all
this
because
he
s
got
his
head
full
of
Voltaire
The
old
man
had
a
special
dislike
to
Voltaire
and
the
fanatic
Diderot
though
he
had
not
read
a
word
of
their
words
reading
was
not
in
his
line
Piotr
Andreitch
was
not
mistaken
his
son
s
head
for
that
matter
was
indeed
full
of
both
Diderot
and
Voltaire
and
not
only
of
them
alone
of
Rousseau
too
and
Helvetius
and
many
other
writers
of
the
same
kind
but
they
were
in
his
head
only
The
retired
abbe
and
encyclopedist
who
had
been
Ivan
Petrovitch
s
tutor
had
taken
pleasure
in
pouring
all
the
wisdom
of
the
eighteenth
century
into
his
pupil
and
he
was
simply
brimming
over
with
it
it
was
there
in
him
but
without
mixing
in
his
blood
nor
penetrating
to
his
soul
nor
shaping
itself
in
any
firm
convictions
But
indeed
could
one
expect
convictions
from
a
young
man
of
fifty
years
ago
when
even
at
the
present
day
we
have
not
succeeded
in
attaining
them
The
guests
too
who
frequented
his
father
s
house
were
oppressed
by
Ivan
Petrovitch
s
presence
he
regarded
them
with
loathing
they
were
afraid
of
him
and
with
his
sister
Glafira
who
was
twelve
years
older
than
he
he
could
not
get
on
at
all
This
Glafira
was
a
strange
creature
she
was
ugly
crooked
and
spare
with
severe
wide-open
eyes
and
thin
compressed
lips
In
her
face
her
voice
and
her
quick
angular
movements
she
took
after
her
grandmother
the
gipsy
Andrei
s
wife
Obstinate
and
fond
of
power
she
would
not
even
hear
of
marriage
The
return
of
Ivan
Petrovitch
did
not
fit
in
with
her
plans
while
the
Princess
Kubensky
kept
him
with
her
she
had
hoped
to
receive
at
least
half
of
her
father
s
estate
in
her
avarice
too
she
was
like
her
grandmother
Besides
Glafira
envied
her
brother
he
was
so
well
educated
spoke
such
good
French
with
a
Parisian
accent
while
she
was
scarcely
able
to
pronounce
bon
jour
or
comment
vous
portez-vous
To
be
sure
her
parents
did
not
know
any
French
but
that
was
no
comfort
to
her
Ivan
Petrovitch
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
for
wretchedness
and
ennui
he
had
spent
hardly
a
year
in
the
country
but
that
year
seemed
to
him
as
long
as
ten
The
only
consolation
he
could
find
was
in
talking
to
his
mother
and
he
would
sit
for
whole
hours
in
her
low-pitched
rooms
listening
to
the
good
woman
s
simple-hearted
prattle
and
eating
preserves
It
so
happened
that
among
Anna
Pavlovna
s
maids
there
was
one
very
pretty
girl
with
clear
soft
eyes
and
refined
features
Malanya
by
name
an
modest
intelligent
creature
She
took
his
fancy
at
first
sight
and
he
fell
in
love
with
her
he
fell
in
love
with
her
timid
movements
her
bashful
answers
her
gentle
voice
and
gentle
smile
every
day
she
seemed
sweeter
to
him
And
she
became
devoted
to
Ivan
Petrovitch
with
all
the
strength
of
her
soul
as
none
but
Russian
girls
can
be
devoted
and
she
gave
herself
to
him
In
the
large
household
of
a
country
squire
nothing
can
long
be
kept
a
secret
soon
every
one
knew
of
the
love
between
the
young
master
and
Malanya
the
gossip
even
reached
the
ears
of
Piotr
Andreitch
himself
Under
other
circumstances
he
would
probably
have
paid
no
attention
to
a
matter
of
so
little
importance
but
he
had
long
had
a
grudge
against
his
son
and
was
delighted
at
an
opportunity
of
humiliating
the
town-bred
wit
and
dandy
A
storm
of
fuss
and
clamour
was
raised
Malanya
was
locked
up
in
the
pantry
Ivan
Petrovitch
was
summoned
into
his
father
s
presence
Anna
Pavlovna
too
ran
up
at
the
hubbub
She
began
trying
to
pacify
her
husband
but
Piotr
Andreitch
would
hear
nothing
He
pounced
down
like
a
hawk
on
his
son
reproached
him
with
immorality
with
godlessness
with
hypocrisy
he
took
the
opportunity
to
vent
on
him
all
the
wrath
against
the
Princess
Kubensky
that
had
been
simmering
within
him
and
lavished
abusive
epithets
upon
him
At
first
Ivan
Petrovitch
was
silent
and
held
himself
in
but
when
his
father
thought
to
fit
to
threaten
him
with
a
shameful
punishment
he
could
endure
it
no
longer
Ah
he
thought
the
fanatic
Diderot
is
brought
out
again
then
I
will
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
I
will
astonish
you
all
And
thereupon
with
a
calm
and
even
voice
though
quaking
inwardly
in
every
limb
Ivan
Petrovitch
declared
to
his
father
that
there
was
no
need
to
reproach
him
with
immorality
that
though
he
did
not
intend
to
justify
his
fault
he
was
ready
to
make
amends
for
it
the
more
willingly
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
superior
to
every
kind
of
prejudice
and
in
fact
was
ready
to
marry
Malanya
In
uttering
these
words
Ivan
Petrovitch
did
undoubtedly
attain
his
object
he
so
astonished
Piotr
Andreitch
that
the
latter
stood
open-eyed
and
was
struck
dumb
for
a
moment
but
instantly
he
came
to
himself
and
just
as
he
was
in
a
dressing-gown
bordered
with
squirrel
fur
and
slippers
on
his
bare
feet
he
flew
at
Ivan
Petrovitch
with
his
fists
The
latter
as
though
by
design
had
that
morning
arranged
his
locks
a
la
Titus
and
put
on
a
new
English
coat
of
a
blue
colour
high
boots
with
little
tassels
and
very
tight
modish
buckskin
breeches
Anna
Pavlovna
shrieked
with
all
her
might
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
but
her
son
ran
over
the
whole
house
dashed
out
into
the
courtyard
rushed
into
the
kitchen-garden
into
the
pleasure-grounds
and
flew
across
into
the
road
and
kept
running
without
looking
round
till
at
last
he
ceased
to
hear
the
heavy
tramp
of
his
father
s
steps
behind
him
and
his
shouts
jerked
out
with
effort
Stop
you
scoundrel
he
cried
stop
or
I
will
curse
you
Ivan
Petrovitch
took
refuge
with
a
neighbour
a
small
landowner
and
Piotr
Andreitch
returned
home
worn
out
and
perspiring
and
without
taking
breath
announced
that
he
should
deprive
his
son
of
his
blessing
and
inheritance
gave
orders
that
all
his
foolish
books
should
be
burnt
and
that
the
girl
Malanya
should
be
sent
to
a
distant
village
without
loss
of
time
Some
kind-hearted
people
found
out
Ivan
Petrovitch
and
let
him
know
everything
Humiliated
and
driven
to
fury
he
vowed
he
would
be
revenged
on
his
father
and
the
same
night
lay
in
wait
for
the
peasant
s
cart
in
which
Malanya
was
being
driven
away
carried
her
off
by
force
galloped
off
to
the
nearest
town
with
her
and
married
her
He
was
supplied
with
money
by
the
neighbour
a
good-natured
retired
marine
officer
a
confirmed
tippler
who
took
an
intense
delight
in
every
kind
of
as
he
expressed
it
romantic
story
The
next
day
Ivan
Petrovitch
wrote
an
ironically
cold
and
polite
letter
to
Piotr
Andreitch
and
set
off
to
the
village
where
lived
his
second
cousin
Dmitri
Pestov
with
his
sister
already
known
to
the
reader
Marfa
Timofyevna
He
told
them
all
announced
his
intention
to
go
to
Petersburg
to
try
to
obtain
a
post
there
and
besought
them
at
least
for
a
time
to
give
his
wife
a
home
At
the
word
wife
he
shed
tears
and
in
spite
of
his
city
breeding
and
philosophy
he
bowed
himself
in
humble
supplicating
Russian
fashion
at
his
relations
feet
and
even
touched
the
ground
with
his
forehead
The
Pestovs
kind-hearted
and
compassionate
people
readily
agreed
to
his
request
He
stayed
with
them
for
three
weeks
secretly
expecting
a
reply
from
his
father
but
no
reply
came
and
there
was
no
chance
of
a
reply
coming
Piotr
Andreitch
on
hearing
of
his
son
s
marriage
took
to
his
bed
and
forbade
Ivan
Petrovitch
s
name
to
be
mentioned
before
him
but
his
mother
without
her
husband
s
knowledge
borrowed
from
the
rector
and
sent
500
roubles
and
a
little
image
to
his
wife
She
was
afraid
to
write
but
sent
a
message
to
Ivan
Petrovitch
by
a
lean
peasant
who
could
walk
fifty
miles
a
day
that
he
was
not
to
take
it
too
much
to
heart
that
please
God
all
would
be
arranged
and
his
father
s
wrath
would
be
turned
to
kindness
that
she
too
would
have
preferred
a
different
daughter-in-law
but
that
she
sent
Malanya
Sergyevna
her
motherly
blessing
The
lean
peasant
received
a
rouble
asked
permission
to
see
the
new
young
mistress
to
whom
he
happened
to
be
godfather
kissed
her
hand
and
ran
off
at
his
best
speed
And
Ivan
Petrovitch
set
off
to
Petersburg
with
a
light
heart
An
unknown
future
awaited
him
poverty
perhaps
menaced
him
but
he
had
broken
away
from
the
country
life
he
detested
and
above
all
he
had
not
been
false
to
his
teachers
he
had
actually
put
into
practice
the
doctrines
of
Rousseau
Diderot
and
la
Declaration
des
droits
de
l
homme
A
sense
of
having
done
his
duty
of
triumph
and
of
pride
filled
his
soul
and
indeed
the
separation
from
his
wife
did
not
greatly
afflict
him
he
would
have
been
more
perturbed
by
the
necessity
of
being
constantly
with
her
That
deed
was
done
now
he
wanted
to
set
about
doing
something
fresh
In
Petersburg
contrary
to
his
own
expectations
he
met
with
success
the
Princess
Kubensky
whom
Monsieur
Courtin
had
by
that
time
deserted
but
who
was
still
living
in
order
to
make
up
in
some
way
to
her
nephew
for
having
wronged
him
gave
him
introductions
to
all
her
friends
and
presented
him
with
5000
roubles
almost
all
that
remained
of
her
money
and
a
Lepkovsky
watch
with
his
monogram
encircled
by
Cupids
Three
months
had
not
passed
before
he
obtained
a
position
in
a
Russian
embassy
to
London
and
in
the
first
English
vessel
that
sailed
steamers
were
not
even
talked
of
then
he
crossed
the
sea
A
few
months
later
he
received
a
letter
from
Pestov
The
good-natured
landowner
congratulated
Ivan
Petrovitch
on
the
birth
of
a
son
who
had
been
born
into
the
world
in
the
village
of
Pokrovskoe
on
the
20th
of
August
1807
and
named
Fedor
in
honour
of
the
holy
martyr
Fedor
Stratilat
On
account
of
her
extreme
weakness
Malanya
Sergyevna
added
only
a
few
lines
but
those
few
lines
were
a
surprise
for
Ivan
Petrovitch
had
not
known
that
Marfa
Timofyevna
had
taught
his
wife
to
read
and
write
Ivan
Petrovitch
did
not
long
abandon
himself
to
the
sweet
emotion
of
parental
feeling
he
was
dancing
attendance
on
a
notorious
Phryne
or
Lais
of
the
day
classical
names
were
still
in
vogue
at
that
date
the
Peace
of
Tilsit
had
only
just
been
concluded
and
all
the
world
was
hurrying
after
pleasure
in
a
giddy
whirl
of
dissipation
and
his
head
had
been
turned
by
the
black
eyes
of
a
bold
beauty
He
had
very
little
money
but
he
was
lucky
at
cards
made
many
acquaintances
took
part
in
all
entertainments
in
a
word
he
was
in
the
swim
For
a
long
time
the
old
Lavretsky
could
not
forgive
his
son
for
his
marriage
If
six
months
later
Ivan
Petrovitch
had
come
to
him
with
a
penitent
face
and
had
thrown
himself
at
his
feet
he
would
very
likely
have
pardoned
him
after
giving
him
a
pretty
severe
scolding
and
a
tap
with
his
stick
by
way
of
intimidating
him
but
Ivan
Petrovitch
went
on
living
abroad
and
apparently
did
not
care
a
straw
Be
silent
I
dare
you
to
speak
of
it
Piotr
Andreitch
said
to
his
wife
every
time
she
ventured
to
try
to
incline
him
to
mercy
The
puppy
he
ought
to
thank
God
for
ever
that
I
have
not
laid
my
curse
upon
him
my
father
would
have
killed
him
the
worthless
scamp
with
his
own
hands
and
he
would
have
done
right
too
At
such
terrible
speeches
Anna
Pavlovna
could
only
cross
herself
secretly
As
for
Ivan
Petrovitch
s
wife
Piotr
Andreitch
at
first
would
not
even
hear
her
name
and
in
answer
to
a
letter
of
Pestov
s
in
which
he
mentioned
his
daughter-in-law
he
went
so
far
as
to
send
him
word
that
he
knew
nothing
of
any
daughter-in-law
and
that
it
was
forbidden
by
law
to
harbour
run-away
wenches
a
fact
which
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
remind
him
of
But
later
on
he
was
softened
by
hearing
of
the
birth
of
a
grandson
and
he
gave
orders
secretly
that
inquiries
should
be
made
about
the
health
of
the
mother
and
sent
her
a
little
money
also
as
though
it
did
not
come
from
him
Fedya
was
not
a
year
old
before
Anna
Pavlovna
fell
ill
with
a
fatal
complaint
A
few
days
before
her
end
when
she
could
no
longer
leave
her
bed
with
timid
tears
in
her
eyes
fast
growing
dim
she
informed
her
husband
in
the
presence
of
the
priest
that
she
wanted
to
see
her
daughter-in-law
and
bid
her
farewell
and
to
give
her
grand-child
her
blessing
The
heart-broken
old
man
soothed
her
and
at
once
sent
off
his
own
carriage
for
his
daughter-in-law
for
the
first
time
giving
her
the
title
of
Malanya
Sergyevna
Malanya
came
with
her
son
and
Marfa
Timofyevna
who
would
not
on
any
consideration
allow
her
to
go
alone
and
was
unwilling
to
expose
her
to
any
indignity
Half
dead
with
fright
Malanya
Sergyevna
went
into
Piotr
Andreitch
s
room
A
nurse
followed
carrying
Fedya
Piotr
Andreitch
looked
at
her
without
speaking
she
went
up
to
kiss
his
hand
her
trembling
lips
were
only
just
able
to
touch
it
with
a
silent
kiss
Well
my
upstart
lady
he
brought
out
at
last
how
do
you
do
let
us
go
to
the
mistress
He
got
up
and
bent
over
Fedya
the
baby
smiled
and
held
out
his
little
white
hands
to
him
This
changed
the
old
man
s
mood
Ah
he
said
poor
little
one
you
were
pleading
for
your
father
I
will
not
abandon
you
little
bird
Directly
Malanya
Sergyevna
entered
Anna
Pavlovna
s
bedroom
she
fell
on
her
knees
near
the
door
Anna
Pavlovna
beckoned
her
to
come
to
her
bedside
embraced
her
and
blessed
her
son
then
turning
a
face
contorted
by
cruel
suffering
to
her
husband
she
made
an
effort
to
speak
I
know
I
know
what
you
want
to
ask
said
Piotr
Andreitch
don
t
fret
yourself
she
shall
stay
with
us
and
I
will
forgive
Vanka
for
her
sake
With
an
effort
Anna
Pavlovna
took
her
husband
s
hand
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
The
same
evening
she
breathed
her
last
Piotr
Andreitch
kept
his
word
He
informed
his
son
that
for
the
sake
of
his
mother
s
dying
hours
and
for
the
sake
of
the
little
Fedor
he
sent
him
his
blessing
and
was
keeping
Malanya
Sergyevna
in
his
house
Two
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
were
devoted
to
her
he
presented
her
to
his
most
honoured
guests
the
one-eyed
brigadier
Skurchin
and
his
wife
and
bestowed
on
her
two
waiting-maids
and
a
page
for
errands
Marfa
Timofyevna
took
leave
of
her
she
detested
Glafira
and
in
the
course
of
one
day
had
fallen
out
with
her
three
times
It
was
a
painful
and
embarrassing
position
at
first
for
poor
Malanya
but
after
a
while
she
learnt
to
bear
it
and
grew
used
to
her
father-in-law
He
too
grew
accustomed
to
her
and
even
fond
of
her
though
he
scarcely
ever
spoke
to
her
and
a
certain
involuntary
contempt
was
perceptible
even
in
his
signs
of
affection
to
her
Malanya
Sergyevna
had
most
to
put
up
with
from
her
sister-in-law
Even
during
her
mother
s
lifetime
Glafira
had
succeeded
by
degrees
in
getting
the
whole
household
into
her
hands
every
one
from
her
father
downwards
submitted
to
her
rule
not
a
piece
of
sugar
was
given
out
without
her
sanction
she
would
rather
have
died
than
shared
her
authority
with
another
mistress
and
with
such
a
mistress
Her
brother
s
marriage
had
incensed
her
even
more
than
Piotr
Andreitch
she
set
herself
to
give
the
upstart
a
lesson
and
Malanya
Sergyevna
from
the
very
first
hour
was
her
slave
And
indeed
how
was
she
to
contend
against
the
masterful
haughty
Glafira
submissive
constantly
bewildered
timid
and
weak
in
health
as
she
was
Not
a
day
passed
without
Glafira
reminding
her
of
her
former
position
and
commending
her
for
not
forgetting
herself
Malanya
Sergyevna
could
have
reconciled
herself
readily
to
these
reminiscences
and
commendations
however
they
might
be
but
Fedya
was
taken
away
from
her
that
was
what
crushed
her
On
the
pretext
that
she
was
not
capable
of
undertaking
his
education
she
was
scarcely
allowed
to
see
him
Glafira
set
herself
to
that
task
the
child
was
put
absolutely
under
her
control
Malanya
Sergyevna
began
in
her
distress
to
beseech
Ivan
Petrovitch
in
her
letters
to
return
home
soon
Piotr
Andreitch
himself
wanted
to
see
his
son
but
Ivan
Petrovitch
did
nothing
but
write
He
thanked
his
father
on
his
wife
s
account
and
for
the
money
sent
him
promised
to
return
quickly
and
did
not
come
The
year
1812
at
last
summoned
him
home
from
abroad
When
they
met
again
after
six
years
absence
the
father
embraced
his
son
and
not
by
a
single
word
made
allusion
to
their
former
differences
it
was
not
a
time
for
that
now
all
Russia
was
rising
up
against
the
enemy
and
both
of
them
felt
that
they
had
Russian
blood
in
their
veins
Piotr
Andreitch
equipped
a
whole
regiment
of
volunteers
at
his
own
expense
But
the
war
came
to
an
end
the
danger
was
over
Ivan
Petrovitch
began
to
be
bored
again
and
again
he
felt
drawn
away
to
the
distance
to
the
world
in
which
he
had
grown
up
and
where
he
felt
himself
at
home
Malanya
Sergyevna
could
not
keep
him
she
meant
too
little
to
him
Even
