as
to
the
nature
of
the
feeling
inspired
in
him
by
Lisa
he
was
brought
on
that
day
to
the
final
conviction
that
he
loved
her
This
conviction
did
not
give
him
ay
great
pleasure
Have
I
really
nothing
better
to
do
he
thought
at
thirty-five
than
to
put
my
soul
into
a
woman
s
keeping
again
But
Lisa
is
not
like
her
she
would
not
demand
degrading
sacrifices
from
me
she
would
not
tempt
me
away
from
my
duties
she
would
herself
incite
me
to
hard
honest
work
and
we
would
walk
hand
in
hand
towards
a
noble
aim
Yes
he
concluded
his
reflections
that
s
all
very
fine
but
the
worst
of
it
is
that
she
does
not
in
the
least
wish
to
walk
hand
in
hand
with
me
She
meant
it
when
she
said
that
I
frightened
her
But
she
doesn
t
love
Panshin
either
a
poor
consolation
Lavretsky
went
back
to
Vassilyevskoe
but
he
could
not
get
through
four
days
there
so
dull
it
seemed
to
him
He
was
also
in
agonies
of
suspense
the
news
announced
by
M
Jules
required
confirmation
and
he
had
received
no
letters
of
any
kind
He
returned
to
the
town
and
spent
an
evening
at
the
Kalitins
He
could
easily
see
that
Marya
Dmitrievna
had
to
been
set
against
him
but
he
succeeded
in
softening
her
a
little
by
losing
fifteen
roubles
to
her
at
picquet
and
he
spent
nearly
half
an
hour
almost
alone
with
Lisa
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
her
mother
had
advised
her
the
previous
evening
not
to
be
too
intimate
with
a
man
qui
a
un
si
grand
ridicule
He
found
a
change
in
her
she
had
become
as
it
were
more
thoughtful
She
reproached
him
for
his
absence
and
asked
him
would
he
not
go
on
the
morrow
to
mass
The
next
day
was
Sunday
Do
go
she
said
before
he
had
time
to
answer
we
will
pray
together
fro
the
repose
of
her
soul
Then
she
added
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
act
she
did
not
know
whether
she
had
the
right
to
make
Panshin
wait
any
longer
for
her
decision
Why
so
inquired
Lavretsky
Because
she
said
I
begin
now
to
suspect
what
that
decision
will
be
She
declared
that
her
head
ached
and
went
to
her
own
room
up-stairs
hesitatingly
holding
out
the
tips
of
her
fingers
to
Lavretsky
The
next
day
Lavretsky
went
to
mass
Lisa
was
already
in
the
church
when
he
came
in
She
noticed
him
though
she
did
not
turn
round
towards
him
She
prayed
fervently
her
eyes
were
full
of
a
calm
light
calmly
she
bowed
her
head
and
lifted
it
again
He
felt
that
she
was
praying
for
him
too
and
his
heart
was
filled
with
a
marvelous
tenderness
He
was
happy
and
a
little
ashamed
The
people
reverently
standing
the
homely
faces
the
harmonious
singing
the
scent
of
incense
the
long
slanting
gleams
of
light
from
the
windows
the
very
darkness
of
the
walls
and
arched
roofs
all
went
to
his
heart
For
long
he
had
not
been
to
church
for
long
he
had
not
turned
to
God
even
now
he
uttered
no
words
of
prayer
he
did
not
even
pray
without
words
but
at
least
for
a
moment
in
all
his
mind
if
not
in
his
body
he
bowed
down
and
meekly
humbled
himself
to
earth
He
remembered
how
in
his
childhood
he
had
always
prayed
in
church
until
he
had
felt
as
it
were
a
cool
touch
on
his
brow
that
he
used
to
think
then
is
the
guardian
angel
receiving
me
laying
on
me
the
seal
of
grace
He
glanced
at
Lisa
You
brought
me
here
he
thought
touch
me
touch
my
soul
She
was
still
praying
calmly
her
face
seemed
him
to
him
full
of
joy
and
he
was
softened
anew
he
prayed
for
another
soul
peace
for
his
own
forgiveness
They
met
in
the
porch
she
greeted
him
with
glad
and
gracious
seriousness
The
sun
brightly
lighted
up
the
young
grass
in
the
church-yard
and
the
striped
dresses
and
kerchiefs
of
the
women
the
bells
of
the
churches
near
were
tinkling
overhead
and
the
crows
were
cawing
about
the
hedges
Lavretsky
stood
with
uncovered
head
a
smile
on
his
lips
the
light
breeze
lifted
his
hair
and
the
ribbons
of
Lisa
s
hat
He
put
Lisa
and
Lenotchka
who
was
with
her
into
their
carriage
divided
all
his
money
among
the
poor
and
peacefully
sauntered
home
Painful
days
followed
for
Fedor
Ivanitch
He
found
himself
in
a
continual
fever
Every
morning
he
made
for
the
post
and
tore
open
letters
and
papers
in
agitation
and
nowhere
did
he
find
anything
which
could
confirm
or
disprove
the
fateful
rumour
Sometimes
he
was
disgusting
to
himself
What
am
I
about
he
thought
waiting
like
a
vulture
for
blood
for
certain
news
of
my
wife
s
death
He
went
to
the
Kalitins
every
day
but
things
had
grown
no
easier
for
him
there
the
lady
of
the
house
was
obviously
sulky
with
him
and
received
him
very
condescendingly
Panshin
treated
him
with
exaggerated
politeness
Lemm
had
entrenched
himself
in
his
misanthropy
and
hardly
bowed
to
him
and
worst
of
all
Lisa
seemed
to
avoid
him
When
she
happened
to
be
left
alone
with
him
instead
of
her
former
candour
there
was
visible
embarrassment
on
her
part
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
and
he
too
felt
confused
In
the
space
of
a
few
days
Lisa
had
become
quite
different
from
what
she
was
as
he
knew
her
in
her
movements
her
voice
her
very
laugh
a
secret
tremor
an
unevenness
never
there
before
was
apparent
Marya
Dmitrievna
like
a
true
egoist
suspected
nothing
but
Marfa
Timofyevna
began
to
keep
a
watch
over
her
favourite
Lavretsky
more
than
once
reproached
himself
for
having
shown
Lisa
the
newspaper
he
had
received
he
could
not
but
be
conscious
that
in
his
spiritual
condition
there
was
something
revolting
to
a
pure
nature
He
imagined
also
that
the
change
in
Lisa
was
the
result
of
her
inward
conflicts
her
doubts
as
to
what
answer
to
give
Panshin
One
day
she
brought
him
a
book
a
novel
of
Walter
Scott
s
which
she
had
herself
asked
him
for
Have
you
read
it
he
said
No
I
can
t
bring
myself
to
read
just
now
she
answered
and
was
about
to
go
away
Stop
a
minute
it
is
so
long
since
I
have
been
alone
with
you
You
seem
to
be
afraid
of
me
Yes
Why
so
pray
I
don
t
know
Lavretsky
was
silent
Tell
me
he
began
you
haven
t
yet
decided
What
do
you
mean
she
said
not
raising
her
eyes
You
understand
me
Lisa
flushed
crimson
all
at
once
Don
t
ask
me
about
anything
she
broke
out
hotly
I
know
nothing
I
don
t
know
myself
And
instantly
she
was
gone
The
following
day
Lavretsky
arrived
at
the
Kalitins
after
dinner
and
found
there
all
the
preparations
for
an
evening
service
In
the
corner
of
the
dining-room
on
a
square
table
covered
with
a
clean
cloth
were
already
arranged
leaning
up
against
the
wall
the
small
holy
pictures
in
old
frames
set
with
tarnished
jewels
The
old
servant
in
a
grey
coat
and
shoes
was
moving
noiselessly
and
without
haste
all
about
the
room
he
set
two
wax-candles
in
the
slim
candlesticks
before
the
holy
pictures
crossed
himself
bowed
and
slowly
went
out
The
unlighted
drawing-room
was
empty
Lavretsky
went
into
the
dining-room
and
asked
if
it
was
some
one
s
name-day
In
a
whisper
the
told
him
no
but
that
the
evening
service
had
been
arranged
at
the
desire
of
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
and
Marfa
Timofyevna
that
it
had
been
intended
to
invite
a
wonder-working
image
but
that
the
latter
had
gone
thirty
versts
away
to
visit
a
sick
man
Soon
the
priest
arrived
with
the
deacons
he
was
a
man
no
longer
young
with
a
large
bald
head
he
coughed
loudly
in
the
hall
the
ladies
at
once
filed
slowly
out
of
the
boudoir
and
went
up
to
receive
his
blessing
Lavretsky
bowed
to
them
in
silence
and
in
silence
to
him
The
priest
stood
still
for
a
little
while
coughed
once
again
and
asked
in
a
bass
undertone
You
wish
me
to
begin
Pray
begin
father
replied
Marya
Dmitrievna
He
began
to
put
on
his
robes
a
deacon
in
a
surplice
asked
obsequiously
for
a
hot
ember
there
was
a
scent
of
incense
The
maids
and
men-servants
came
out
from
the
hall
and
remained
huddled
close
together
before
the
door
Roska
who
never
came
down
from
up-stairs
suddenly
ran
into
the
dining-room
they
began
to
chase
her
out
she
was
scared
doubled
back
into
the
room
and
sat
down
a
footman
picked
her
up
and
carried
her
away
The
evening
service
began
Lavretsky
squeezed
himself
into
a
corner
his
emotions
were
strange
almost
sad
he
could
not
himself
make
out
clearly
what
he
was
feeling
Marya
Dmitrievna
stood
in
front
of
all
before
the
chairs
she
crossed
herself
with
languid
carelessness
like
a
grand
lady
and
first
looked
about
her
then
suddenly
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
ceiling
she
was
bored
Marfa
Timofyevna
looked
worried
Nastasya
Karpovna
bowed
down
to
the
ground
and
got
up
with
a
kind
of
discreet
subdued
rustle
Lisa
remained
standing
in
her
place
motionless
from
the
concentrated
expression
of
her
face
it
could
be
seen
that
she
was
praying
steadfastly
and
fervently
When
she
bowed
to
the
cross
at
the
end
of
the
service
she
also
kissed
the
large
red
hand
of
the
priest
Marya
Dmitrievna
invited
the
latter
to
have
some
tea
he
took
off
his
vestment
assumed
a
somewhat
more
worldly
air
and
passed
into
the
drawing-room
with
the
ladies
Conversation
not
too
lively
began
The
priest
drank
four
cups
of
tea
incessantly
wiping
his
bald
head
with
his
handkerchief
he
related
among
other
things
that
the
merchant
Avoshnikov
was
subscribing
seven
hundred
roubles
to
gilding
the
cumpola
of
the
church
and
informed
them
of
a
sure
remedy
against
freckles
Lavretsky
tried
to
sit
near
Lisa
but
her
manner
was
severe
almost
stern
and
she
did
not
once
glance
at
him
She
appeared
intentionally
not
to
observe
him
a
kind
of
cold
grave
enthusiasm
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
her
Lavretsky
for
some
reason
or
other
tried
to
smile
and
to
say
something
amusing
but
there
was
perplexity
in
his
heart
and
he
went
away
at
last
in
secret
bewilderment
He
felt
there
was
something
in
Lisa
to
which
he
could
never
penetrate
Another
time
Lavretsky
was
sitting
in
the
drawing-room
listening
to
the
sly
but
tedious
gossip
of
Gedeonovsky
when
suddenly
without
himself
knowing
why
he
turned
round
and
caught
a
profound
attentive
questioning
look
in
Lisa
s
eyes
It
was
bent
on
him
this
enigmatic
look
Lavretsky
thought
of
it
the
whole
night
long
His
love
was
not
like
a
boy
s
sighs
and
agonies
were
not
in
his
line
and
Lisa
herself
did
not
inspire
a
passion
of
that
kind
but
for
every
age
love
has
its
tortures
and
he
was
spared
none
of
them
One
day
Lavretsky
according
to
his
habit
was
at
the
Kalitins
After
an
exhaustingly
hot
day
such
a
lovely
evening
had
set
in
that
Marya
Dmitrievna
in
spite
of
her
aversion
to
a
draught
ordered
all
the
windows
and
doors
into
the
garden
to
be
thrown
open
and
declared
that
she
would
not
play
cards
that
it
was
a
sin
to
play
cards
in
such
weather
and
one
ought
to
enjoy
nature
Panshin
was
the
only
guest
He
was
stimulated
by
the
beauty
of
the
evening
and
conscious
of
a
flood
of
artistic
sensations
but
he
did
not
care
to
sing
before
Lavretsky
so
he
fell
to
reading
poetry
he
read
aloud
well
but
too
self-consciously
and
with
unnecessary
refinements
a
few
poems
of
Lermontov
Pushkin
had
not
then
come
into
fashion
again
Then
suddenly
as
though
ashamed
of
his
enthusiasm
began
a
propos
of
the
well-known
poem
A
Reverie
to
attack
and
fall
foul
of
the
younger
generation
While
doing
so
he
did
not
lose
the
opportunity
of
expounding
how
he
would
change
everything
after
his
own
fashion
if
the
power
were
in
his
hands
Russia
he
said
has
fallen
behind
Europe
we
must
catch
her
up
It
is
maintained
that
we
are
young
that
s
nonsense
Moreover
we
have
no
inventiveness
Homakov
himself
admits
that
we
have
not
even
invented
mouse-traps
Consequently
whether
we
will
or
no
we
must
borrow
from
others
We
are
sick
Lermontov
says
I
agree
with
him
But
we
are
sick
from
having
only
half
become
Europeans
we
must
take
a
hair
of
the
dog
that
bit
us
le
cadastre
thought
Lavretsky
The
best
head
les
meilleures
tetes
he
continued
among
us
have
long
been
convinced
of
it
All
peoples
are
essentially
alike
only
introduce
among
them
good
institutions
and
the
thing
is
done
Of
course
there
may
be
adaptation
to
the
existing
national
life
that
is
our
affair
the
affair
of
the
official
he
almost
said
governing
class
But
in
case
of
need
don
t
be
uneasy
The
institutions
will
transform
the
life
itself
Marya
Dmitrievna
most
feelingly
assented
to
all
Panshin
said
What
a
clever
man
she
thought
is
talking
in
my
drawing-room
Lisa
sat
in
silence
leaning
back
against
the
window
Lavretsky
too
was
silent
Marfa
Timofyevna
playing
cards
with
her
old
friend
in
the
corner
muttered
something
to
herself
Panshin
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
spoke
eloquently
but
with
secret
exasperation
It
seemed
as
if
he
were
abusing
not
a
whole
generation
but
a
few
people
known
to
him
In
a
great
lilac
bush
in
the
Kalitins
garden
a
nightingale
had
built
its
nest
its
first
evening
notes
filled
the
pauses
of
the
eloquent
speech
the
first
stars
were
beginning
to
shine
in
the
rosy
sky
over
the
motionless
tops
of
the
limes
Lavretsky
got
up
and
began
to
answer
Panshin
an
argument
sprang
up
Lavretsky
championed
the
youth
and
the
independence
of
Russia
he
was
ready
to
throw
over
himself
and
his
generation
but
he
stood
up
for
the
new
men
their
convictions
and
desires
Panshin
answered
sharply
and
irritably
He
maintained
that
the
intelligent
people
ought
to
change
everything
and
was
at
last
even
brought
to
the
point
of
forgetting
his
position
as
a
kammer-yunker
and
his
career
as
an
official
and
calling
Lavretsky
an
antiquated
conservative
even
hinting
very
remotely
it
is
true
at
his
dubious
position
in
society
Lavretsky
did
not
lose
his
temper
He
did
not
raise
his
voice
he
recollected
that
Mihalevitch
too
had
called
him
antiquated
but
an
antiquated
Voltairean
and
calmly
proceeded
to
refute
Panshin
at
all
points
He
proved
to
him
the
impracticability
of
sudden
leaps
and
reforms
from
above
founded
neither
on
knowledge
of
the
mother-country
nor
on
any
genuine
faith
in
any
ideal
even
a
negative
one
He
brought
forward
his
own
education
as
an
example
and
demanded
before
all
things
a
recognition
of
the
true
spirit
of
the
people
and
submission
to
it
without
which
even
a
courageous
combat
against
error
is
impossible
Finally
he
admitted
the
reproach
well-deserved
as
he
thought
of
reckless
waste
of
time
and
strength
That
is
all
very
fine
cried
Panshin
at
last
getting
angry
You
now
have
just
returned
to
Russia
what
do
you
intend
to
do
Cultivate
the
soil
answered
Lavretsky
and
try
to
cultivate
it
as
well
as
possible
That
is
very
praiseworthy
no
doubt
rejoined
Panshin
and
I
have
been
told
that
you
have
already
had
great
success
in
that
line
but
you
must
allow
that
not
every
one
is
fit
for
pursuits
of
that
kind
Une
nature
poetique
observed
Marya
Dmitrievna
can
not
to
be
sure
cultivate
et
puis
it
is
your
vocation
Vladimir
Nikolaich
to
do
everything

This
was
too
much
even
for
Panshin
he
grew
confused
and
changed
the
conversation
He
tried
to
turn
it
upon
the
beauty
of
the
starlit
sky
the
music
of
Schubert
nothing
was
successful
He
ended
by
proposing
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
a
game
of
picquet
What
on
such
an
evening
she
replied
feebly
She
ordered
the
cards
to
be
brought
in
however
Panshin
tore
open
a
new
pack
of
cards
with
a
loud
crash
and
Lisa
and
Lavretsky
both
got
up
as
if
by
agreement
and
went
and
placed
themselves
near
Marfa
Timofyevna
They
both
felt
all
at
once
so
happy
that
they
were
even
a
little
afraid
of
remaining
alone
together
and
at
the
same
time
they
both
felt
that
the
embarrassment
they
had
been
conscious
of
for
the
last
few
days
had
vanished
and
would
return
no
more
The
old
lady
stealthily
patted
Lavretsky
on
the
cheek
slyly
screwed
up
her
eyes
and
shook
her
head
once
or
twice
adding
in
a
whisper
You
have
shut
up
our
clever
friend
many
thanks
Everything
was
hushed
in
the
room
the
only
sound
was
the
faint
crackling
of
the
wax-candles
and
sometimes
the
tap
of
a
hand
on
the
table
and
an
exclamation
or
reckoning
of
points
and
the
rich
torrent
of
the
nightingale
s
song
powerful
piercingly
sweet
poured
in
at
the
window
together
with
the
dewy
freshness
of
the
night
Lisa
had
not
uttered
a
word
in
the
course
of
the
dispute
between
Lavretsky
and
Panshin
but
she
had
followed
it
attentively
and
was
completely
on
Lavretsky
s
side
Politics
interested
her
very
little
but
the
supercilious
tone
of
the
worldly
official
he
had
never
delivered
himself
in
that
way
before
repelled
her
his
contempt
for
Russia
wounded
her
It
had
never
occurred
to
Lisa
that
she
was
a
patriot
but
her
heart
was
with
the
Russian
people
the
Russian
turn
of
mind
delighted
her
she
would
talk
for
hours
together
without
ceremony
to
the
peasant-overseer
of
her
mother
s
property
when
he
came
to
the
town
and
she
talked
to
him
as
to
an
equal
without
any
of
the
condescension
of
a
superior
Lavretsky
felt
all
this
he
would
not
have
troubled
himself
to
answer
Panshin
by
himself
he
had
spoken
only
for
Lisa
s
sake
They
had
said
nothing
to
one
another
their
eyes
even
had
seldom
met
But
they
both
knew
that
they
had
grown
closer
that
evening
they
knew
that
they
liked
and
disliked
the
same
things
On
one
point
only
were
they
divided
but
Lisa
secretly
hoped
to
bring
him
to
God
They
sat
near
Marfa
Timofyevna
and
appeared
to
be
following
her
play
indeed
they
were
really
following
it
but
meanwhile
their
hearts
were
full
and
nothing
was
lost
on
them
for
them
the
nightingale
sang
and
the
stars
shone
and
the
trees
gently
murmured
lulled
to
sleep
by
the
summer
warmth
and
softness
Lavretsky
was
completely
carried
away
and
surrendered
himself
wholly
to
his
passion
and
rejoiced
in
it
But
no
word
can
express
what
was
passing
in
the
pure
heart
of
the
young
girl
It
was
a
mystery
for
herself
Let
it
remain
a
mystery
for
all
No
one
knows
no
one
has
seen
nor
will
ever
see
how
the
grain
destined
to
life
and
growth
swells
and
ripens
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
Ten
o
clock
struck
Marfa
Timofyevna
went
off
up-stairs
to
her
own
apartments
with
Nastasya
Karpovna
Lavretsky
and
Lisa
walked
across
the
room
stopped
at
the
open
door
into
the
garden
looked
into
the
darkness
in
the
distance
and
then
at
one
another
and
smiled
They
could
have
taken
each
other
s
hands
it
seemed
and
talked
to
their
hearts
content
They
returned
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
Panshin
where
a
game
of
picquet
was
still
dragging
on
The
last
king
was
called
at
last
and
the
lady
of
the
house
rose
sighing
and
groaning
from
her
well-cushioned
easy
chair
Panshin
took
his
hat
kissed
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
hand
remarking
that
nothing
hindered
some
happy
people
now
from
sleeping
but
that
he
had
to
sit
up
over
stupid
papers
till
morning
and
departed
bowing
coldly
to
Lisa
he
had
not
expected
that
she
would
ask
him
to
wait
so
long
for
an
answer
to
his
offer
and
he
was
cross
with
her
for
it
Lavretsky
followed
him
They
parted
at
the
gate
Panshin
walked
his
coachman
by
poking
him
in
the
neck
with
the
end
of
his
stick
took
his
seat
in
the
carriage
and
rolled
away
Lavretsky
did
not
want
to
go
home
He
walked
away
from
the
town
into
the
open
country
The
night
was
still
and
clear
though
there
was
no
moon
Lavretsky
rambled
a
long
time
over
the
dewy
grass
He
came
across
a
little
narrow
path
and
went
along
it
It
led
him
up
to
a
long
fence
and
to
a
little
gate
he
tried
not
knowing
why
to
push
it
open
With
a
faint
creak
the
gate
opened
as
though
it
had
been
waiting
the
touch
of
his
hand
Lavretsky
went
into
the
garden
After
a
few
paces
along
a
walk
of
lime-trees
he
stopped
short
in
amazement
he
recognised
the
Kalitins
garden
He
moved
at
once
into
a
black
patch
of
shade
thrown
by
a
thick
clump
of
hazels
and
stood
a
long
while
without
moving
shrugging
his
shoulders
in
astonishment
This
can
not
be
for
nothing
he
thought
All
was
hushed
around
From
the
direction
of
the
house
not
a
sound
reached
him
He
went
cautiously
forward
At
the
bend
of
an
avenue
suddenly
the
whole
house
confronted
him
with
its
dark
face
in
two
upstair-windows
only
a
light
was
shining
In
Lisa
s
room
behind
the
white
curtain
a
candle
was
burning
and
in
Marfa
Timofyevna
s
bedroom
a
lamp
shone
with
red-fire
before
the
holy
picture
and
was
reflected
with
equal
brilliance
on
the
gold
frame
Below
the
door
on
to
the
balcony
gaped
wide
open
Lavretsky
sat
down
on
a
wooden
garden-seat
leaned
on
his
elbow
and
began
to
watch
this
door
and
Lisa
s
window
In
the
town
it
struck
midnight
a
little
clock
in
the
house
shrilly
clanged
out
twelve
the
watchman
beat
it
with
jerky
strokes
upon
his
board
Lavretsky
had
no
thought
no
expectation
it
was
sweet
to
him
to
feel
himself
near
Lisa
to
sit
in
her
garden
on
the
seat
where
she
herself
had
sat
more
than
once
The
light
in
Lisa
s
room
vanished
Sleep
well
my
sweet
girl
whispered
Lavretsky
still
sitting
motionless
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
darkened
window
Suddenly
the
light
appeared
in
one
of
the
windows
of
the
ground-floor
then
changed
into
another
and
a
third
Some
one
was
walking
through
the
rooms
with
a
candle
Can
it
be
Lisa
It
can
not
be
Lavretsky
got
up
He
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
well-known
face
Lisa
came
into
the
drawing-room
In
a
white
gown
her
plaits
hanging
loose
on
her
shoulders
she
went
quietly
up
to
the
table
bent
over
it
put
down
the
candle
and
began
looking
for
something
Then
turning
round
facing
the
garden
she
drew
near
the
open
door
and
stood
on
the
threshold
a
light
slender
figure
all
in
white
A
shiver
passed
over
Lavretsky
Lisa
broke
hardly
audibly
from
his
lips
She
started
and
began
to
gaze
into
the
darkness
Lisa
Lavretsky
repeated
louder
and
he
came
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
avenue
Lisa
raised
her
head
in
alarm
and
shrank
back
She
had
recognised
him
He
called
to
her
a
third
time
and
stretched
out
his
hands
to
her
She
came
away
from
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
garden
Is
it
you
she
said
You
here
I
I
listen
to
me
whispered
Lavretsky
and
seizing
her
hand
he
led
her
to
the
seat
She
followed
him
without
resistance
her
pale
face
her
fixed
eyes
and
all
her
gestures
expressed
an
unutterable
bewilderment
Lavretsky
made
her
sit
down
and
stood
before
her
I
did
not
mean
to
come
here
he
began
Something
brought
me
I
I
love
you
he
uttered
in
involuntary
terror
Lisa
slowly
looked
at
him
It
seemed
as
though
she
only
at
that
instant
knew
where
she
was
and
what
was
happening
She
tried
to
get
up
she
could
no
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
Lisa
murmured
Lavretsky
Lisa
he
repeated
and
fell
at
her
feet
Her
shoulders
began
to
heave
slightly
the
fingers
of
her
pale
hands
were
pressed
more
closely
to
her
face
What
is
it
Lavretsky
urged
and
he
heard
a
subdued
sob
His
heart
stood
still
He
knew
the
meaning
of
those
tears
Can
it
be
that
you
love
me
he
whispered
and
caressed
her
knees
Get
up
he
heard
her
voice
get
up
Fedor
Ivanitch
What
are
we
doing
He
got
up
and
sat
beside
her
on
the
seat
She
was
not
weeping
now
and
she
looked
at
him
steadfastly
with
her
wet
eyes
It
frightens
me
what
are
we
doing
she
repeated
I
love
you
he
said
again
I
am
ready
to
devote
my
whole
life
to
you
She
shuddered
again
as
though
something
had
stung
her
and
lifted
her
eyes
towards
heaven
All
that
is
in
God
s
hands
she
said
But
you
love
me
Lisa
We
shall
be
happy
She
dropped
her
eyes
he
softly
drew
her
to
him
and
her
head
sank
on
to
his
shoulder
He
bent
his
head
a
little
and
touched
her
pale
lips
Half
an
hour
later
Lavretsky
was
standing
before
the
little
garden
gate
He
found
it
locked
and
was
obliged
to
get
over
the
fence
He
returned
to
the
town
and
walked
along
the
slumbering
streets
A
sense
of
immense
unhoped-for
happiness
filled
his
soul
all
his
doubts
had
died
away
Away
dark
phantom
of
the
past
he
thought
She
loves
me
she
will
be
mine
Suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
air
over
his
head
were
floating
strains
of
divine
triumphant
music
He
stood
still
The
music
resounded
in
still
greater
magnificence
a
mighty
flood
of
melody
and
all
his
bliss
seemed
speaking
and
singing
in
its
strains
He
looked
about
him
the
music
floated
down
from
two
upper
windows
of
a
small
house
Lemm
cried
Lavretsky
as
he
ran
to
the
house
Lemm
Lemm
he
repeated
aloud
The
sounds
died
away
and
the
figure
of
the
old
man
in
a
dressing-gown
with
his
throat
bare
and
his
hair
dishevelled
appeared
at
the
window
Aha
he
said
with
dignity
is
it
you
Christopher
Fedoritch
what
marvellous
music
for
mercy
s
sake
let
me
in
Without
uttering
a
word
the
old
man
with
a
majestic
flourish
of
the
arm
dropped
the
key
of
the
street
door
from
the
window
Lavretsky
hastened
up-stairs
went
into
the
room
and
was
about
to
rush
up
to
Lemm
but
the
latter
imperiously
motioned
him
to
a
seat
saying
abruptly
in
Russian
Sit
down
and
listen
sat
down
himself
to
the
piano
and
looking
proudly
and
severely
about
him
he
began
to
play
It
was
long
since
Lavretsky
had
listened
to
anything
like
it
The
sweet
passionate
melody
went
to
his
heart
from
the
first
note
it
was
glowing
and
languishing
with
inspiration
happiness
and
beauty
it
swelled
and
melted
away
it
touched
on
all
that
is
precious
mysterious
and
holy
on
earth
It
breathed
of
deathless
sorrow
and
mounted
dying
away
to
the
heavens
Lavretsky
drew
himself
up
and
rose
cold
and
pale
with
ecstasy
This
music
seemed
to
clutch
his
very
soul
so
lately
shaken
by
the
rapture
of
love
the
music
was
glowing
with
love
too
Again
he
whispered
as
the
last
chord
sounded
The
old
man
threw
him
an
eagle
glance
struck
his
hand
on
his
chest
and
saying
deliberately
in
his
own
tongue
This
is
my
work
I
am
a
great
musician
he
played
again
his
marvellous
composition
There
was
no
candle
in
the
room
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
fell
aslant
on
the
window
the
soft
air
was
vibrating
with
sound
the
poor
little
room
seemed
a
holy
place
and
the
old
man
s
head
stood
out
noble
and
inspired
in
the
silvery
half
light
Lavretsky
went
up
to
him
and
embraced
him
At
first
Lemm
did
not
respond
to
his
embrace
and
even
pushed
him
away
with
his
elbow
For
a
long
while
without
moving
in
any
limb
he
kept
the
same
severe
almost
morose
expression
and
only
growled
out
twice
aha
At
last
his
face
relaxed
changed
and
grew
calmer
and
in
response
to
Lavretsky
s
warm
congratulations
he
smiled
a
little
at
first
then
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
weakly
like
a
child
It
is
wonderful
he
said
that
you
have
come
just
at
this
moment
but
I
know
all
I
know
all
You
know
all
Lavretsky
repeated
in
amazement
You
have
heard
me
replied
Lemm
did
you
not
understand
that
I
knew
all
Till
daybreak
Lavretsky
could
not
sleep
all
night
he
was
sitting
on
his
bed
And
Lisa
too
did
not
sleep
she
was
praying
The
reader
knows
how
Lavretsky
grew
up
and
developed
Let
us
say
a
few
words
about
Lisa
s
education
She
was
in
her
tenth
year
when
her
father
died
but
he
had
not
troubled
himself
much
about
her
Weighed
down
with
business
cares
for
ever
anxious
for
the
increase
of
his
property
bilious
sharp
and
impatient
he
gave
money
unsparingly
for
the
teachers
tutors
dress
and
other
necessities
of
his
children
but
he
could
not
endure
as
he
expressed
it
to
be
dandling
his
squallers
and
indeed
had
no
time
to
dandle
them
He
worked
took
no
rest
from
business
slept
little
rarely
played
cards
and
worked
again
He
compared
himself
to
a
horse
harnessed
to
a
threshing-machine
My
life
has
soon
come
to
an
end
was
his
comment
on
his
deathbed
with
a
bitter
smile
on
his
parched
lips
Marya
Dmitrievna
did
not
in
reality
trouble
herself
about
Lisa
any
more
than
her
husband
though
she
had
boasted
to
Lavretsky
that
she
alone
had
educated
her
children
She
dressed
her
up
like
a
doll
stroked
her
on
the
head
before
visitors
and
called
her
a
clever
child
and
