mysterious
whisper
her
opinions
and
prognostications
on
the
subject
of
Evgenii
Vasilitch
Finally
Arina
Vlasievna
's
pleasurable
emotion
coupled
with
the
wine
and
the
tobacco
smoke
so
caused
the
old
lady
's
head
to
start
whirling
that
when
her
husband
came
to
bed
he
found
himself
obliged
to
moderate
her
exuberance
with
a
gesture
Arina
Vlasievna
was
a
true
Russian
housewife
of
the
old
school
That
is
to
say
she
ought
to
have
lived
a
couple
of
hundred
years
earlier
during
the
period
when
the
ancient
Muscovite
Empire
was
in
being
At
once
pious
and
extremely
nervous
she
believed
in
every
species
of
portent
divination
proverb
and
vision
also
in
such
things
as
urodivïe
9
household
demons
wood
spirits
unlucky
encounters
spells
popular
medicines
Thursday
salt
and
an
ever-imminent
end
to
the
world
Again
she
placed
much
faith
in
such
ideas
as
that
if
a
lighted
candle
lasts
through
the
night
preceding
Easter
Day
the
buckwheat
crops
will
come
up
well
that
should
a
human
eye
chance
to
fall
upon
a
mushroom
during
the
process
of
its
growth
such
growth
will
terminate
forthwith
that
the
devil
loves
to
be
where-soever
there
is
water
and
that
all
Jews
bear
on
their
breasts
a
blood-red
stain
Again
she
stood
in
great
awe
of
mice
adders
frogs
sparrows
leeches
thunder
cold
water
draughts
horses
billy-goats
fair
men
and
black
cats
and
also
looked
upon
crickets
and
dogs
as
unclean
creatures
Again
she
never
ate
veal
pigeons
crabs
cheese
asparagus
artichokes
hare
or
water
melons
the
last-named
for
the
reason
that
when
split
open
they
reminded
her
of
the
head
of
John
the
Baptist
Nor
could
she
ever
speak
of
oysters
without
a
shudder
Again
though
she
loved
eating
she
observed
every
fast
though
she
slept
ten
hours
out
of
the
twenty-four
she
never
even
went
to
bed
if
Vasili
Ivanitch
had
got
a
headache
she
read
no
books
beyond
Alexis
or
Siskins
of
the
Forest
she
wrote
at
most
two
letters
a
year
she
knew
every
wrinkle
as
regards
the
departments
of
housekeeping
boiling
and
baking
and
that
even
though
she
herself
never
laid
a
finger
upon
anything
and
hated
even
to
have
to
stir
from
her
place
she
was
aware
that
there
were
certain
folk
in
the
world
who
must
command
and
others
who
must
serve
wherefore
she
loved
servility
and
genuflexions
she
treated
all
her
subordinates
with
kindness
and
consideration
she
sent
never
a
beggar
away
empty
and
she
condemned
no
one
for
a
fault
although
at
times
she
had
a
tendency
to
talk
scandal
Likewise
in
her
youth
she
had
been
comely
and
a
player
of
the
clavichord
and
able
to
speak
a
little
French
but
owing
to
long
residence
with
a
husband
whom
she
had
married
purely
for
love
she
had
grown
rusty
in
those
accomplishments
and
forgotten
alike
her
French
and
her
music
she
loved
and
feared
her
son
to
a
degree
almost
beyond
expression
she
deputed
the
management
of
her
property
entirely
to
Vasili
Ivanitch
and
never
interfered
with
it
but
would
fall
to
gasping
and
waving
her
handkerchief
about
and
affrightedly
raising
her
eyebrows
whenever
her
helpmeet
happened
to
broach
some
new
plan
or
some
necessary
reform
which
he
had
in
his
mind
's
eye
and
lastly
she
was
of
so
apprehensive
a
temperament
that
she
lived
in
constant
fear
of
some
unknown
misfortune
and
would
burst
into
tears
should
any
one
mention
anything
of
a
mournful
character
Such
women
are
now
extinct
and
only
God
knows
whether
we
ought
to
be
glad
of
the
fact

Urodivïe
or
sacred
imbeciles
were
persons
who
deficient
of
intellect
in
the
ordinary
sense
were
yet
believed
by
ancient
Russia
to
enjoy
particularly
intimate
communication
with
the
divine
and
the
unseen
When
in
the
morning
Arkady
rose
and
opened
the
window
the
first
object
to
greet
his
eyes
was
Vasili
Ivanitch
Clad
in
a
smock-frock
and
belted
with
a
handkerchief
the
old
man
was
busily
digging
in
his
vegetable
garden
As
soon
as
he
noticed
his
young
guest
he
leaned
upon
his
spade
and
cried
Good
morning
How
have
you
slept
Splendidly
replied
Arkady
And
I
as
you
see
am
imitating
Cincinnatus
and
preparing
a
bed
of
late
turnips
By
the
mercy
of
God
do
the
times
compel
every
man
to
win
his
bread
with
his
own
hands
At
all
times
indeed
is
it
useless
to
rely
upon
others
it
is
best
to
work
oneself
Thus
Jean
Jacques
Rousseau
was
right
Half
an
hour
ago
however
you
would
have
seen
me
in
a
very
different
rôle
first
of
all
injecting
opium
into
a
woman
who
had
come
to
me
with
what
the
peasants
call
I
the
goad
and
we
dysentery
and
then
pulling
out
some
teeth
for
a
second
woman
And
would
you
believe
it
when
I
proposed
administering
ether
to
the
second
woman
she
would
have
none
of
it
These
things
I
do
gratis
you
know
and
as
an
amateur
Yet
let
that
not
surprise
you
for
after
all
I
am
but
a
plebeian
but
a
homo
novus
Come
downstairs
to
sit
in
the
shade
and
enjoy
the
freshness
of
the
morning
until
breakfast
shall
be
ready
Arkady
did
as
invited
You
confer
a
favour
upon
me
said
Vasili
Ivanitch
raising
his
hand
in
military
fashion
to
the
battered
skull-cap
which
adorned
his
head
You
see
I
know
you
to
be
used
to
luxury
and
ease
Yet
even
the
folk
of
the
great
world
need
not
disdain
to
snatch
a
brief
respite
under
the
roof
of
a
cottage
I
neither
belong
to
the
great
world
nor
am
used
to
luxury
protested
Arkady
Come
now
Vasili
Ivanitch
indulged
in
an
amiable
affectation
of
incredulity
I
myself
though
I
am
now
on
the
shelf
have
rubbed
about
in
my
time
and
can
tell
a
bird
by
its
flight
Also
I
dabble
a
little
in
physiognomy
and
psychology
For
that
matter
I
will
not
hesitate
to
say
that
had
I
not
enjoyed
those
advantages
I
should
long
ago
have
come
to
rack
and
ruin
for
the
reason
that
being
one
of
the
small
fry
I
should
soon
have
been
jostled
out
of
the
way
by
the
crowd
Also
without
flattery
I
may
say
that
the
friendship
which
I
discern
to
be
existing
between
you
and
my
son
affords
me
the
greatest
pleasure
Only
this
moment
I
was
speaking
to
him
for
as
probably
you
know
he
jumps
out
of
bed
at
a
very
early
hour
and
goes
careering
all
over
the
countryside
M-might
I
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
you
whether
you
have
known
him
long
Only
since
last
winter
Indeed
Also
might
I
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
whether
But
sit
you
down
will
you
not
might
I
also
as
his
father
venture
to
ask
your
frank
opinion
of
him
Your
son
is
the
most
remarkable
man
that
I
have
ever
met
came
the
enthusiastic
reply
Vasili
Ivanitch
's
eyes
closed
suddenly
while
his
cheeks
quivered
and
the
spade
slipped
from
his
hand
Then
you
think
he
began
I
do
not
think
I
am
certain
that
there
lies
before
your
son
a
future
which
will
make
your
name
famous
I
have
felt
certain
of
this
since
the
first
moment
I
met
him
Indeed
Indeed
Vasili
Ivanitch
could
scarcely
articulate
the
words
but
on
his
capacious
lips
there
had
dawned
and
become
fixed
a
smile
of
triumph
Would
you
like
to
hear
how
our
first
meeting
came
about
Indeed
I
should
And
any
other
details
you
like
Arkady
therefore
plunged
into
a
discourse
on
Bazarov
of
the
same
ardour
and
the
same
enthusiasm
as
he
had
displayed
on
the
night
of
the
mazurka
with
Madame
Odintsov
As
Vasili
Ivanitch
listened
he
blew
his
nose
rolled
his
handkerchief
into
a
ball
coughed
and
ruffled
his
hair
until
no
longer
able
to
contain
himself
he
reached
over
in
Arkady's
direction
and
pressed
his
lips
to
the
young
man
's
shoulder
You
have
indeed
cheered
my
heart
he
exclaimed
still
smiling
I
simply
idolise
my
son
But
while
my
dear
old
wife
is
able
to
stand
on
rather
a
different
footing
with
Evgenii
she
is
his
mother
you
know
I
myself
dare
not
express
my
whole
feelings
in
his
presence
for
the
reason
that
he
dislikes
such
things
and
is
opposed
to
any
manifestations
of
emotion
For
the
same
reason
some
folk
accuse
him
of
hardness
of
heart
and
pride
and
insensibility
but
men
like
Evgenii
can
not
be
measured
by
ordinary
standards
can
they
For
example
any
one
but
he
would
have
gone
on
acting
as
a
drag
upon
his
parents
but
would
you
believe
it
never
once
since
his
birth
has
he
asked
us
for
a
kopeck
more
than
he
absolutely
needed
There
by
God
Yes
your
son
is
a
sincere
single-minded
man
agreed
Arkady
Yes
single-minded
affirmed
Vasili
Ivanitch
And
not
only
do
I
idolise
him
I
am
proud
of
him
and
have
as
my
one
conceit
the
hope
that
some
day
there
may
stand
in
his
biography
the
following
words
'He
was
the
son
of
a
plain
military
doctor
who
nevertheless
had
the
wit
to
divine
the
merits
of
the
subject
of
this
book
and
to
spare
no
pains
in
his
education
The
old
man
's
voice
faltered
for
a
moment
but
presently
resumed
What
think
you
Will
the
field
of
medicine
bring
him
the
fame
which
you
have
foretold
Not
the
field
of
medicine
alone
though
in
it
as
elsewhere
he
will
become
a
leader
What
field
then
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
I
could
not
say
But
in
any
case
he
will
rise
to
fame
'He
will
rise
to
fame
The
old
man
relapsed
into
a
state
of
ecstatic
contemplation
Presently
Anfisushka
arrived
with
a
large
plate
of
raspberries
and
the
message
Arina
Vlasievna
has
sent
me
to
say
that
breakfast
is
ready
Vasili
Ivanitch
started
from
his
reverie
Bring
us
also
some
nice
cool
plums
he
said
I
will
sir
Yes
mind
that
they
are
cool
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
do
not
stand
on
ceremony
but
help
yourself
Is
Evgenii
Vasilitch
yet
back
Anfisushka
I
am
called
Bazarov
from
Arkady
's
room
Vasili
Ivanitch
wheeled
about
Aha
he
cried
So
you
have
gone
to
pay
your
friend
a
visit
But
you
are
too
late
amice
he
and
I
have
been
having
a
long
conversation
together
and
it
is
now
breakfast
time
and
your
mother
is
calling
us
By
the
way
Evgenii
a
word
or
two
with
you
Concerning
what
Concerning
a
peasant
who
is
suffering
from
jaundice
Jaundice
Yes
of
a
very
chronic
and
stubborn
kind
I
have
prescribed
scurvy
grass
and
St
John
's
wort
and
ordered
the
man
to
eat
carrots
and
given
him
a
dose
of
soda
but
such
things
are
mere
palliatives
I
want
something
of
a
more
drastic
nature
That
you
laugh
at
medicine
I
am
of
course
aware
but
none
the
less
I
feel
certain
that
you
could
give
me
some
good
practical
advice
But
that
you
can
do
later
At
the
present
moment
let
us
go
in
to
breakfast
And
he
leapt
from
the
bench
on
which
he
had
been
seated
trolling
gaily
the
couplet
Let
us
take
for
our
rule
for
our
rule
let
us
take
it
To
live
but
for
pleasure
and
never
forsake
it
What
high
spirits
Bazarov
remarked
as
he
retired
from
the
window
Later
when
the
noontide
sun
was
glowing
from
behind
a
thin
canopy
of
dense
pale
vapour
and
all
was
still
save
that
the
chirping
of
a
few
birds
in
the
trees
lulled
the
hearer
to
a
curious
drowsy
lethargy
and
the
incessant
call
of
a
young
hawk
on
a
topmost
bough
made
the
air
ring
with
its
strident
note
Arkady
and
Bazarov
made
for
themselves
pillows
of
sweet
dry
fragrant
crackling
hay
and
stretched
themselves
in
the
shadow
of
a
rick
Do
you
see
that
aspen
tree
remarked
Bazarov
I
mean
the
one
growing
at
the
edge
of
a
depression
where
a
brick
kiln
used
to
stand
Well
when
I
was
a
boy
I
used
to
believe
that
together
the
depression
and
the
aspen
tree
constituted
a
special
talisman
in
that
when
near
them
I
never
found
time
hang
heavy
upon
my
hands
Of
course
the
explanation
is
that
in
those
days
I
failed
to
understand
that
that
immunity
from
ennui
was
due
to
the
very
fact
of
my
being
a
boy
But
now
that
I
am
grown
up
the
talisman
seems
to
have
lost
its
power
How
long
were
you
here
in
those
days
Only
two
years
After
that
we
moved
elsewhere
In
fact
we
led
a
wandering
life
and
spent
it
mostly
in
towns
Is
the
house
an
old
one
It
is
My
maternal
grandfather
built
it
Who
was
he
The
devil
only
knows
I
think
a
major
of
some
sort
a
man
who
had
served
under
Suvorov
1
and
could
tell
all
manner
of
tales
about
crossing
the
Alps
though
I
daresay
he
told
plenty
of
lies
too
Ah
I
noticed
a
portrait
of
Suvorov
in
the
drawing-room
Cheerful-looking
old
houses
like
this
I
simply
love
Somehow
they
seem
to
have
a
smell
of
their
own
Yes
a
smell
of
lamp-oil
mingled
with
trefoil
agreed
Bazarov
with
a
yawn
But
what
flies
they
contain
as
well
There
was
a
pause
Then
Arkady
resumed
Were
you
strictly
kept
when
you
were
a
boy
You
have
seen
for
yourself
what
my
parents
are
like
Surely
they
do
not
seem
very
severe
folk
And
do
you
love
them
very
much
I
do
Certainly
they
seem
to
love
you
Bazarov
was
silent
Presently
however
clasping
his
hands
behind
his
head
he
asked
Do
you
know
what
is
in
my
mind
No
What
I
am
thinking
of
the
pleasant
life
that
my
parents
must
lead
To
think
that
at
sixty
my
father
can
still
fuss
about
and
talk
of
'palliatives
and
doctor
people
and
do
the
bountiful
to
the
peasants
and
in
short
enjoy
himself
and
that
my
mother
has
her
days
so
crammed
full
of
occupations
including
sighing
and
groaning
that
she
does
not
know
which
to
begin
upon
first
On
the
other
hand
I
Yes
you
Am
doing
what
you
see
lying
under
a
rick
The
space
occupied
by
my
body
is
small
indeed
compared
with
the
surrounding
immensity
in
which
it
has
neither
part
nor
lot
and
the
portion
of
time
allotted
to
me
here
on
earth
is
insignificant
indeed
compared
with
the
eternity
which
I
have
never
known
and
shall
never
enter
Yet
in
this
same
atom
in
this
same
mathematical
point
which
I
call
my
body
the
blood
circulates
and
the
brain
operates
at
will
A
fine
discrepancy
for
you
a
fine
futility
I
would
remark
that
what
you
have
just
said
applies
to
every
human
being
in
creation
True
What
I
mean
is
that
my
parents
know
not
a
single
tedious
moment
nor
are
in
the
least
distressed
with
the
thought
of
their
insignificance
it
is
a
thought
which
never
stinks
in
their
nostrils
whereas
I
well
I
feel
nothing
but
weariness
and
rancour
in
my
breast
Rancour
Why
rancour
How
can
you
ask
Have
you
forgotten
the
recent
past
No
only
I
do
not
recognise
your
right
to
be
angry
unhappy
perhaps
but
not
I
perceive
you
to
understand
love
as
it
is
understood
by
all
our
modern
young
men
That
is
to
say
chirping
'Tsip
tsip
tsip
like
pullets
you
take
to
your
heels
as
soon
as
ever
you
see
love
approaching
I
however
am
different
But
enough
of
this
What
is
past
help
is
best
not
talked
about
Bazarov
rolled
over
on
to
his
elbow
Ah
Here
is
a
young
ant
towing
in
its
wake
a
half-dead
fly
Pull
brother
pull
Never
mind
that
the
fly
hangs
back
but
avail
yourself
of
your
animal
right
to
abjure
all
sympathy
seeing
that
our
friend
has
only
himself
to
thank
for
his
trouble
Do
not
speak
like
that
expostulated
Arkady
How
are
you
yourself
to
thank
for
your
trouble
Bazarov
raised
his
head
Nay
he
said
I
was
but
jesting
Never
have
I
got
myself
into
trouble
and
never
shall
any
woman
do
it
for
me
Amen
I
have
spoken
Never
will
you
hear
from
me
another
word
on
the
subject
For
a
while
the
two
friends
lay
without
speaking
Yes
continued
Bazarov
man
is
a
strange
being
Contemplating
from
a
distance
the
dull
life
led
by
my
parents
one
would
almost
feel
inclined
to
say
to
oneself
'What
could
be
better
than
that
seeing
that
in
that
existence
one
merely
eats
and
drinks
and
knows
oneself
to
be
acting
in
a
sane
and
regular
manner
Yet
a
man
will
still
become
depressed
and
yearn
for
company
even
though
he
may
curse
it
when
he
has
got
it
One
ought
so
to
order
one
's
life
that
every
moment
in
it
shall
be
of
significance
said
Arkady
sententiously
Of
course
but
while
the
significant
and
even
the
pseudo-significant
yes
the
absolutely
insignificant
as
well
may
be
bearable
it
is
trifles
trifles
that
matter
Unless
a
man
recognise
their
existence
they
do
not
exist
H
'm
A
contra-platitude
What
is
that
This
that
should
you
say
that
education
is
useful
you
will
be
uttering
a
platitude
but
should
you
say
that
education
is
harmful
you
will
be
uttering
a
contra-platitude
The
one
is
identical
with
the
other
except
that
they
differ
a
little
in
elegance
of
expression
And
which
has
right
on
its
side
'Which
has
right
on
its
side
I
can
only
re-echo
'Which
Come
You
are
out
of
spirits
to-day
Am
I
Then
the
sun
must
have
touched
me
a
little
or
else
I
must
have
eaten
too
many
raspberries
to
be
good
for
me
Then
you
would
do
well
to
have
a
sleep
I
think
you
are
right
Only
do
not
look
at
me
while
I
sleep
for
a
man
cuts
his
very
worst
figure
at
such
a
time
Surely
you
do
not
care
for
people
's
opinion
I
do
even
though
a
man
in
the
best
sense
of
the
term
ought
never
to
trouble
his
head
about
such
things
seeing
that
such
a
man
is
either
above
criticism
or
too
feared
and
hated
for
critics
to
wish
to
tackle
him
Curious
For
I
myself
never
hate
any
one
And
I
hate
a
great
many
people
You
you
see
are
a
tender
soul
you
are
so
much
pap
and
therefore
hatred
could
never
come
within
your
purview
People
as
retiring
as
devoid
of
self-confidence
as
you
are
What
about
your
own
self-confidence
interrupted
Arkady
What
about
your
own
opinion
of
yourself
Bazarov
paused
then
replied
As
we
were
passing
the
hut
of
your
starosta
to-day
what
a
neat
pretty
little
place
it
looked
you
said
to
me
'Not
until
every
peasant
shall
have
come
to
own
such
a
place
as
this
and
every
one
of
us
shall
have
contributed
his
mite
to
that
end
will
Russia
attain
perfection
But
for
my
part
I
abominate
the
scurvy
churl
for
whom
I
am
supposed
to
jump
out
of
my
skin
even
though
never
a
'thank
you
should
I
get
from
him
for
doing
so
For
why
should
he
thank
me
His
métier
happens
to
be
living
in
a
white
hut
and
mine
to
be
Come
come
Evgenii
One
is
almost
forced
to
agree
with
those
who
accuse
us
of
being
unprincipled
You
talk
like
your
uncle
No
such
thing
as
principle
exists
That
you
seem
never
to
have
divined
Instincts
only
exist
and
upon
them
everything
depends
How
so
Thus
We
will
take
myself
as
an
example
Owing
to
the
nature
of
my
instincts
I
am
prone
to
deny
I
am
prone
to
deny
because
my
brain
is
so
constituted
In
the
same
way
if
you
were
to
ask
me
why
I
am
interested
in
chemistry
and
why
you
like
apples
I
should
reply
that
the
same
reason
holds
good
in
each
case
that
our
respective
instincts
are
what
they
are
In
other
words
there
exists
between
your
instincts
and
mine
a
certain
affinity
Deeper
it
is
not
given
us
to
probe
Then
is
honour
an
instinct
It
is
Oh
Evgenii
cried
Arkady
sorrowfully
Do
you
dislike
the
conversation
Then
let
us
philosophise
no
more
but
'permit
nature
to
waft
upon
us
the
silence
of
sleep
to
quote
Pushkin
Pushkin
never
said
any
such
thing
objected
Arkady
Then
if
he
did
not
he
ought
being
a
poet
to
have
done
so
Perhaps
he
had
served
in
the
army
Never
did
he
serve
in
the
army
Indeed
Why
in
his
every
line
we
come
across
'To
battle
to
battle
for
the
honour
of
Russia
That
is
a
mere
invention
on
your
part
The
statement
is
an
absolute
calumny
A
calumny
What
matters
a
calumny
What
is
there
in
the
term
to
be
afraid
of
Slander
a
man
as
much
as
you
like
yet
for
himself
he
will
hear
things
twenty
times
worse
Suppose
we
sleep
said
Arkady
irritably
With
pleasure
Bazarov
replied
Nevertheless
neither
succeeded
in
the
effort
for
almost
every
sleep-destroying
sentiment
happened
to
be
in
the
ascendant
So
after
five
minutes
of
such
ineffectual
striving
both
opened
their
eyes
and
lay
mutely
gazing
about
then
Look
cried
Arkady
after
a
pause
Do
you
see
that
withered
maple
leaf
fluttering
to
the
ground
Are
not
its
movements
exactly
like
those
of
a
butterfly
Strange
that
an
object
so
joyous
and
full
of
life
should
be
able
so
to
counterfeit
an
object
mournful
and
dead
My
friend
protested
Bazarov
let
me
make
at
least
this
request
of
you
that
you
do
not
talk
in
'beautiful
language
I
talk
as
I
am
able
I
decline
to
be
domineered
over
Should
a
thought
chance
to
enter
my
head
why
should
I
not
express
it
Similarly
am
I
at
liberty
to
express
the
thought
that
to
talk
in
'beautiful
language
is
sheerly
indecent
Indecent
Then
swearing
is
not
indecent
Aha
I
perceive
you
still
to
be
minded
to
follow
in
your
uncle's
footsteps
How
the
idiot
would
have
rejoiced
if
he
could
have
heard
you
What
did
you
call
Paul
Petrovitch
I
called
him
merely
what
he
is
merely
an
idiot
Have
done
shouted
Arkady
Therein
I
detect
the
tie
of
blood
said
Bazarov
calmly
It
is
a
very
stubborn
factor
I
have
noticed
in
some
people
A
man
may
abjure
everything
else
and
cut
himself
adrift
from
every
other
prejudice
yet
still
remain
powerless
to
confess
that
the
brother
who
habitually
steals
his
shirts
is
a
thief
You
see
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
word
'my
Is
not
that
so
No
It
was
from
a
sense
of
justice
rather
than
from
a
sense
of
kinship
that
I
spoke
But
since
you
have
no
understanding
of
the
former
as
an
instinct
which
you
simply
do
not
possess
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
pass
judgment
upon
such
a
feeling
In
other
words
'I
Arkady
Kirsanov
am
altogether
above
your
comprehension
Well
I
make
mute
obeisance
to
that
Come
come
Evgenii
We
shall
end
by
quarrelling
Oh
that
you
would
do
me
the
favour
to
quarrel
We
could
have
a
real
set-to
à
outrance
and
with
our
coats
off
To
the
end
that
To
the
end
that
we
might
rend
one
another
in
pieces
Why
not
Here
amid
the
hay
in
this
idyllic
setting
far
from
the
madding
crowd
and
every
human
eye
it
would
be
not
at
all
a
bad
thing
No
you
shall
not
make
it
up
with
me
Rather
will
I
seize
you
by
the
throat
As
he
extended
his
long
sharp
fingers
Arkady
rolled
over
and
prepared
jestingly
to
grapple
with
his
assailant
But
the
next
moment
the
sight
of
Bazarov
's
face
with
its
expression
of
malice
and
the
non-jesting
menace
which
lurked
in
the
twisted
smile
and
the
flashing
eyes
gave
him
a
shock
and
filled
him
with
involuntary
awe
This
then
is
where
you
have
got
to
cried
Vasili
Ivanitch
from
behind
them
as
vested
in
a
home-made
cotton
pea-jacket
and
a
home-made
straw
hat
the
old
military
doctor
suddenly
confronted
the
pair
I
have
been
searching
for
you
everywhere
and
certainly
you
have
chosen
a
capital
spot
and
are
engaged
also
in
a
capital
occupation
in
the
occupation
of
lying
on
the
earth
and
gazing
at
the
heavens
For
my
part
I
believe
that
such
an
occupation
can
have
its
uses
I
gaze
at
the
heavens
only
when
I
am
going
to
sneeze
said
Bazarov
Then
turning
to
Arkady
he
added
in
an
undertone
Forgive
me
if
I
hurt
you
Do
not
mention
it
was
Arkady
's
rejoinder
in
a
similar
undertone
as
covertly
he
pressed
his
friend
's
hand
Shocks
of
such
a
kind
however
were
bound
in
time
to
react
upon
their
friendship
As
I
look
at
you
young
gentlemen
Vasili
Ivanitch
continued
as
nodding
his
head
he
rested
his
hands
upon
a
crooked
stick
his
own
manufacture
which
had
a
Turk
's
head
for
a
handle
I
can
not
sufficiently
admire
you
What
strength
you
embody
How
you
speak
of
the
flower
of
youth
of
capacity
and
of
talent
You
resemble
Castor
and
Pollux
themselves
To
think
of
your
flaunting
your
mythology
like
that
said
Bazarov
At
the
same
time
you
must
have
been
a
fine
Latin
scholar
in
your
day
In
fact
did
not
you
once
receive
a
silver
medal
for
an
essay
The
Dioscuri
the
Dioscuri
themselves
continued
the
old
man
ecstatically
Come
come
father
Do
not
play
the
fool
Ah
well
No
I
have
not
sought
you
out
to
pay
you
compliments
I
have
come
to
inform
the
pair
of
you
that
dinner
is
nearly
ready
and
also
to
give
you
Evgenii
a
warning
I
know
that
as
a
man
of
sense
as
well
as
a
man
well
versed
in
the
world
you
will
be
charitable
The
case
is
this
This
morning
your
mother
took
it
into
her
head
to
organise
a
thanksgiving
ceremony
on
the
occasion
of
your
return
No
do
not
think
that
I
am
inviting
you
to
the
ceremony
on
the
contrary
it
is
over
All
that
I
am
going
to
say
is
that
Father
Alexis
The
priest
Yes
and
our
private
confessor
Well
this
Father
Alexis
is
going
to
dine
with
us
even
though
I
had
not
expected
it
and
it
was
not
my
suggestion
but
merely
an
arrangement
which
has
come
about
somehow
probably
through
his
having
failed
to
understand
me
aright
Not
that
we
look
upon
him
as
anything
but
a
man
of
rectitude
and
good
sense
Surely
you
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
he
is
likely
to
devour
my
portion
of
the
food
do
you
Vasili
Ivanitch
burst
out
laughing
Ha
ha
ha
he
cried
I
feel
easy
then
continued
Bazarov
In
fact
never
do
I
mind
with
whom
I
sit
at
table
Vasili
Ivanitch
's
face
brightened
at
once
I
felt
sure
of
that
in
advance
he
said
Yes
I
knew
that
you
a
young
man
are
as
superior
to
prejudice
as
I
am
at
sixty-two
Vasili
had
none
the
less
shrunk
from
confessing
that
he
had
wished
for
the
thanksgiving
ceremony
as
much
as
his
wife
had
since
his
piety
was
fully
equal
to
hers
In
any
case
Father
Alexis
would
like
to
make
your
acquaintance
while
you
for
your
part
will
very
likely
take
to
him
seeing
that
he
not
only
plays
cards
but
also
though
this
is
quite
between
ourselves
smokes
a
pipe
Indeed
After
dinner
then
we
will
have
a
game
and
I
will
despoil
him
utterly
Ha
ha
ha
We
shall
see
we
shall
see
Then
at
times
you
hark
back
to
old
days
Bazarov
asked
with
a
tinge
of
surprise
Vasili
Ivanitch
's
bronzed
cheeks
took
on
a
faint
flush
For
shame
Evgenii
he
muttered
Remember
that
the
past
is
the
past
Nevertheless
even
in
this
gentleman
's
presence
I
am
ready
to
confess
that
in
my
youth
I
had
my
addictions
and
that
since
I
have
paid
for
them
But
how
hot
the
weather
is
Let
me
seat
myself
beside
you
though
I
hope
that
in
doing
so
I
shall
not
interrupt
your
conversation
By
no
means
replied
Arkady
with
alacrity
Vasili
Ivanitch
subsided
with
a
grunt
and
the
remark
Your
logement
reminds
me
of
my
military
bivouacking
days
this
rick
being
a
dressing-station
There
followed
a
sigh
Aye
many
and
many
an
experience
have
I
had
in
my
time
For
instance
let
me
tell
you
a
curious
story
about
the
black
death
in
Bessarabia
When
you
received
the
order
of
St
Vladimir
said
Bazarov
Yes
I
know
the
story
But
why
do
you
never
wear
the
badge
of
the
order
As
I
have
told
you
I
care
not
a
jot
for
appearances
protested
Vasili
Ivanitch
though
only
on
the
previous
day
had
he
had
the
red
riband
of
the
order
removed
from
his
coat
He
then
embarked
upon
the
story
Evgenii
has
gone
to
sleep
presently
he
whispered
to
Arkady
with
a
good-humoured
wink
and
a
pointing
finger
Come
come
Evgenii
he
added
in
a
louder
tone
It
is
time
to
get
up
Time
for
dinner
Father
Alexis
a
stout
good-looking
man
with
thick
well-combed
hair
and
an
embroidered
girdle
over
a
lilac
cassock
proved
a
clever
resourceful
guest
who
taking
the
initiative
as
regards
shaking
hands
with
Arkady
and
Bazarov
somehow
he
seemed
to
divine
that
they
did
not
require
his
blessing
bore
himself
in
general
with
complete
absence
of
restraint
and
while
neither
demeaning
himself
nor
imposing
general
constraint
made
merry
over
scholastic
Latin
defended
his
archbishop
quaffed
a
couple
of
glasses
of
wine
refusing
