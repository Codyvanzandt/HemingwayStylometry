's
done
Well
while
I
was
thinking
it
over
it
got
quite
dark
it
was
time
for
bed
I
went
to
bed
and
Tr
sor
of
course
was
close
by
me
But
whether
it
was
from
the
fight
from
the
stuffiness
from
the
fleas
or
from
my
thoughts
I
could
not
get
to
sleep
do
what
I
would
I
ca
n't
describe
the
depression
that
came
over
me
I
sipped
water
opened
the
window
and
played
the
'Kamarinsky
with
Italian
variations
on
the
guitar
No
good
I
felt
I
must
get
out
of
the
room
and
that
was
all
about
it
I
made
up
my
mind
at
last
I
took
my
pillow
my
quilt
and
my
sheet
and
made
my
way
across
the
garden
to
the
hayloft
and
settled
myself
there
And
how
pleasant
I
felt
in
there
gentlemen
it
was
a
still
still
night
only
from
time
to
time
a
breath
of
air
like
a
woman
's
hand
caressed
one
's
cheek
it
was
so
fresh
the
hay
smelt
as
sweet
as
tea
among
the
apple
trees
the
grasshoppers
were
chirping
then
all
at
once
came
the
cry
of
the
quail
and
one
felt
that
he
too
the
rogue
was
happy
sitting
in
the
dew
with
his
little
lady
And
the
sky
was
magnificent
The
stars
were
glowing
or
a
cloud
would
float
by
white
as
cotton
wool
scarcely
moving
At
this
point
in
the
story
Skvorevitch
sneezed
Kinarevitch
sneezed
too
he
never
failed
in
anything
to
follow
his
colleague
's
example
Anton
Stepanitch
looked
approvingly
at
both
of
them
Well
Porfiry
Kapitonitch
went
on
well
so
I
lay
there
and
again
could
not
go
to
sleep
I
fell
to
musing
and
what
I
thought
of
most
was
the
strangeness
of
it
all
how
correctly
Prohoritch
had
explained
it
as
a
warning
and
I
wondered
why
it
was
to
me
such
marvels
had
happened
I
marvelled
particularly
because
I
could
make
nothing
of
it
and
Tr
sor
kept
whining
as
he
twisted
round
in
the
hay
his
wounds
hurt
him
And
I
will
tell
you
what
else
prevented
me
from
sleeping
you
wo
n't
believe
it
the
moon
It
was
just
facing
me
so
big
and
round
and
yellow
and
flat
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
staring
at
me
it
really
did
And
so
insolently
so
persistently
I
put
out
my
tongue
at
it
at
last
I
really
did
What
are
you
so
inquisitive
about
I
thought
I
turned
away
from
it
and
it
seemed
to
be
creeping
into
my
ear
and
shining
on
the
back
of
my
head
so
that
I
felt
caught
in
it
as
in
rain
I
opened
my
eyes
and
every
blade
of
grass
every
paltry
being
in
the
hay
the
most
flimsy
spider
's
web
all
were
standing
out
as
though
they
were
chiselled
As
though
asking
to
be
looked
at
There
was
no
help
for
it
I
leaned
my
head
on
my
hand
and
began
gazing
And
I
could
n't
help
it
would
you
believe
it
my
eyes
bulged
out
like
a
hare
's
they
opened
so
wide
as
though
they
did
not
know
what
sleep
was
It
seemed
as
though
I
would
devour
it
all
with
my
eyes
The
doors
of
the
barn
were
wide
open
I
could
see
for
four
miles
into
the
open
country
distinctly
and
yet
not
as
it
always
is
on
a
moonlight
night
I
gazed
and
gazed
without
blinking
And
all
at
once
it
seemed
as
though
something
were
moving
far
far
away
like
a
faint
glimmer
in
the
distance
A
little
time
passed
again
the
shadow
stirred
now
a
little
nearer
then
again
nearer
still
'What
can
it
be
I
wondered
'a
hare
no
I
thought
'it
is
bigger
than
a
hare
and
its
action
is
not
the
same
I
looked
and
again
the
shadow
came
in
sight
and
was
moving
across
the
grazing
meadow
the
meadow
looked
whitish
in
the
moonlight
like
a
big
blur
it
was
clear
that
it
was
a
wild
animal
a
fox
or
a
wolf
My
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
though
one
might
wonder
why
I
was
frightened
All
sorts
of
wild
creatures
run
about
the
fields
at
night
But
curiosity
was
even
stronger
than
fear
I
sat
up
I
opened
my
eyes
wide
and
I
turned
cold
all
over
I
felt
frozen
as
though
I
had
been
thrust
into
the
ice
up
to
my
ears
and
why
The
Lord
only
knows
And
I
saw
the
shadow
growing
and
growing
so
it
was
running
straight
towards
the
barn
And
I
began
to
realise
that
it
certainly
was
a
wild
beast
big
with
a
huge
head
He
flew
like
a
whirlwind
like
a
bullet
Holy
saints
what
was
it
He
stopped
all
at
once
as
though
he
scented
something
Why
it
was
the
same
mad
dog
It
was
it
was
Heavens
And
I
could
not
stir
I
could
not
cry
out
It
darted
to
the
doors
with
glittering
eyes
howled
and
dashed
through
the
hay
straight
at
me
Out
of
the
hay
like
a
lion
leapt
my
Tr
sor
here
he
was
They
hung
on
to
each
other
's
jaws
and
rolled
on
the
ground
What
happened
then
I
do
n't
remember
all
I
remember
is
that
I
flew
headlong
between
them
into
the
garden
and
home
and
into
my
bedroom
and
almost
crept
under
the
bed
why
not
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
And
what
leaps
what
bounds
I
took
in
the
garden
The
pr
miere
danseuse
dancing
before
the
Emperor
Napoleon
on
his
nameday
could
n't
have
kept
pace
with
me
However
when
I
had
recovered
myself
a
little
I
roused
the
whole
household
I
ordered
them
all
to
arm
themselves
I
myself
took
a
sword
and
a
revolver
I
bought
that
revolver
I
must
own
soon
after
the
emancipation
you
know
in
case
anything
should
happen
but
it
turned
out
the
man
who
sold
it
was
such
a
rogue
it
would
be
sure
to
miss
fire
twice
out
of
every
three
shots
Well
I
took
all
this
and
so
we
went
a
regular
horde
of
us
with
stakes
and
lanterns
to
the
barn
We
approached
and
called
there
was
not
a
sound
at
last
we
went
into
the
barn
And
what
did
we
see
My
poor
Tr
sor
lay
dead
with
his
throat
torn
open
and
of
the
other
the
damned
brute
not
a
trace
to
be
seen
And
then
gentlemen
I
howled
like
a
calf
and
I
am
not
ashamed
to
say
so
I
stooped
down
to
the
friend
who
had
saved
my
life
twice
over
and
kissed
his
head
again
and
again
And
I
stayed
in
that
position
until
my
old
housekeeper
Praskovya
she
too
had
run
in
at
the
uproar
brought
me
to
my
senses
'How
can
you
Porfiry
Kapitonitch
she
said
'distress
yourself
so
about
a
dog
And
you
will
catch
cold
too
God
forbid
I
was
very
lightly
clad
'And
if
this
dog
has
lost
his
life
in
saving
you
it
may
be
taken
as
a
great
blessing
vouchsafed
him
Though
I
did
not
agree
with
Praskovya
I
went
home
And
next
day
a
soldier
of
the
garrison
shot
the
mad
dog
And
it
must
have
been
its
destined
end
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
the
soldier
had
fired
a
gun
though
he
had
a
medal
for
service
in
1812
So
this
was
the
supernatural
incident
that
happened
to
me
The
speaker
ceased
and
began
filling
his
pipe
We
all
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
Well
perhaps
you
have
led
a
very
virtuous
life
Mr
Finoplentov
began
so
in
recompense
But
he
broke
off
at
that
word
for
he
saw
Porfiry
Kapitonitch
's
cheeks
grow
round
and
flushed
while
his
eyes
screwed
up
he
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
into
a
guffaw
But
if
one
admits
the
possibility
of
the
supernatural
the
possibility
of
its
participation
in
everyday
life
so
to
say
Anton
Stepanitch
began
again
then
allow
me
to
ask
what
becomes
of
common
sense
None
of
us
found
anything
to
say
in
reply
and
we
remained
in
perplexity
as
before
1866
THE
WATCH
AN
OLD
MAN
'S
STORY
I
will
tell
you
my
adventures
with
a
watch
It
is
a
curious
story
It
happened
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
century
in
1801
I
had
just
reached
my
sixteenth
year
I
was
living
at
Ryazan
in
a
little
wooden
house
not
far
from
the
bank
of
the
river
Oka
with
my
father
my
aunt
and
my
cousin
my
mother
I
do
not
remember
she
died
three
years
after
her
marriage
my
father
had
no
other
children
His
name
was
Porfiry
Petrovitch
He
was
a
quiet
man
sickly
and
unattractive
in
appearance
he
was
employed
in
some
sort
of
legal
and
other
business
In
old
days
such
were
called
attorneys
sharpers
nettle-seeds
he
called
himself
a
lawyer
Our
domestic
life
was
presided
over
by
his
sister
my
aunt
an
old
maiden
lady
of
fifty
my
father
too
had
passed
his
fourth
decade
My
aunt
was
very
pious
or
to
speak
bluntly
she
was
a
canting
hypocrite
and
a
chattering
magpie
who
poked
her
nose
into
everything
and
indeed
she
had
not
a
kind
heart
like
my
father
We
were
not
badly
off
but
had
nothing
to
spare
My
father
had
a
brother
called
Yegor
but
he
had
been
sent
to
Siberia
in
the
year
1797
for
some
seditious
acts
and
Jacobin
tendencies
those
were
the
words
of
the
accusation
Yegor
's
son
David
my
cousin
was
left
on
my
father
's
hands
and
lived
with
us
He
was
only
one
year
older
than
I
but
I
respected
him
and
obeyed
him
as
though
he
were
quite
grown
up
He
was
a
sensible
fellow
with
character
in
appearance
thick-set
and
broad-shouldered
with
a
square
face
covered
with
freckles
with
red
hair
small
grey
eyes
thick
lips
a
short
nose
and
short
fingers
a
sturdy
lad
in
fact
and
strong
for
his
age
My
aunt
could
not
endure
him
my
father
was
positively
afraid
of
him
or
perhaps
he
felt
himself
to
blame
towards
him
There
was
a
rumour
that
if
my
father
had
not
given
his
brother
away
David
's
father
would
not
have
been
sent
to
Siberia
We
were
both
at
the
high
school
and
in
the
same
class
and
both
fairly
high
up
in
it
I
was
indeed
a
little
better
at
my
lessons
than
David
I
had
a
good
memory
but
boys
as
we
all
know
do
not
think
much
of
such
superiority
and
David
remained
my
leader
My
name
you
know
is
Alexey
I
was
born
on
the
seventh
of
March
and
my
name-day
is
the
seventeenth
In
accordance
with
the
old-fashioned
custom
I
was
given
the
name
of
the
saint
whose
festival
fell
on
the
tenth
day
after
my
birth
My
godfather
was
a
certain
Anastasy
Anastasyevitch
Putchkov
or
more
exactly
Nastasey
Nastasyeitch
for
that
was
what
everyone
called
him
He
was
a
terribly
shifty
pettifogging
knave
and
bribe-taker
a
thoroughly
bad
man
he
had
been
turned
out
of
the
provincial
treasury
and
had
had
to
stand
his
trial
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
was
often
of
use
to
my
father
They
used
to
do
business
together
In
appearance
he
was
a
round
podgy
figure
and
his
face
was
like
a
fox
's
with
a
nose
like
an
owl
's
His
eyes
were
brown
bright
also
like
a
fox
's
and
he
was
always
moving
them
those
eyes
to
right
and
to
left
and
he
twitched
his
nose
too
as
though
he
were
sniffing
the
air
He
wore
shoes
without
heels
and
wore
powder
every
day
which
was
looked
upon
as
very
exceptional
in
the
provinces
He
used
to
declare
that
he
could
not
go
without
powder
as
he
had
to
associate
with
generals
and
their
ladies
Well
my
name-day
had
come
Nastasey
Nastasyeitch
came
to
the
house
and
said
I
have
never
made
you
a
present
up
to
now
godson
but
to
make
up
for
that
look
what
a
fine
thing
I
have
brought
you
to-day
And
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
silver
watch
a
regular
turnip
with
a
rose
tree
engraved
on
the
face
and
a
brass
chain
I
was
overwhelmed
with
delight
while
my
aunt
Pelageya
Petrovna
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
Kiss
his
hand
kiss
his
hand
dirty
brat
I
proceeded
to
kiss
my
godfather
's
hand
while
my
aunt
went
piping
on
Oh
Nastasey
Nastasyeitch
Why
do
you
spoil
him
like
this
How
can
he
take
care
of
a
watch
He
will
be
sure
to
drop
it
break
it
or
spoil
it
My
father
walked
in
looked
at
the
watch
thanked
Nastasey
Nastasyeitch
somewhat
carelessly
and
invited
him
to
his
study
And
I
heard
my
father
say
as
though
to
himself
If
you
think
to
get
off
with
that
my
man
But
I
could
not
stay
still
I
put
on
the
watch
and
rushed
headlong
to
show
my
present
to
David
David
took
the
watch
opened
it
and
examined
it
attentively
He
had
great
mechanical
ability
he
liked
having
to
do
with
iron
copper
and
metals
of
all
sorts
he
had
provided
himself
with
various
instruments
and
it
was
nothing
for
him
to
mend
or
even
to
make
a
screw
a
key
or
anything
of
that
kind
David
turned
the
watch
about
in
his
hands
and
muttering
through
his
teeth
he
was
not
talkative
as
a
rule
Oh
poor
added
where
did
you
get
it
I
told
him
that
my
godfather
had
given
it
me
David
turned
his
little
grey
eyes
upon
me
Nastasey
Yes
Nastasey
Nastasyeitch
David
laid
the
watch
on
the
table
and
walked
away
without
a
word
Do
you
like
it
I
asked
Well
it
is
n't
that
But
if
I
were
you
I
would
not
take
any
sort
of
present
from
Nastasey
Why
Because
he
is
a
contemptible
person
and
you
ought
not
to
be
under
an
obligation
to
a
contemptible
person
And
to
say
thank
you
to
him
too
I
suppose
you
kissed
his
hand
Yes
Aunt
made
me
David
grinned
a
peculiar
grin
to
himself
That
was
his
way
He
never
laughed
aloud
he
considered
laughter
a
sign
of
feebleness
David
's
words
his
silent
grin
wounded
me
deeply
So
he
inwardly
despises
me
I
thought
So
I
too
am
contemptible
in
his
eyes
He
would
never
have
stooped
to
this
himself
He
would
not
have
accepted
presents
from
Nastasey
But
what
am
I
to
do
now
Give
back
the
watch
Impossible
I
did
try
to
talk
to
David
to
ask
his
advice
He
told
me
that
he
never
gave
advice
to
anyone
and
that
I
had
better
do
as
I
thought
best
As
I
thought
best
I
remember
I
did
not
sleep
all
night
afterwards
I
was
in
agonies
of
indecision
I
was
sorry
to
lose
the
watch
I
had
laid
it
on
the
little
table
beside
my
bed
its
ticking
was
so
pleasant
and
amusing
but
to
feel
that
David
despised
me
yes
it
was
useless
to
deceive
myself
he
did
despise
me
that
seemed
to
me
unbearable
Towards
morning
a
determination
had
taken
shape
in
me
I
wept
it
is
true
but
I
fell
asleep
upon
it
and
as
soon
as
I
woke
up
I
dressed
in
haste
and
ran
out
into
the
street
I
had
made
up
my
mind
to
give
my
watch
to
the
first
poor
person
I
met
I
had
not
run
far
from
home
when
I
hit
upon
what
I
was
looking
for
I
came
across
a
barelegged
boy
of
ten
a
ragged
urchin
who
was
often
hanging
about
near
our
house
I
dashed
up
to
him
at
once
and
without
giving
him
or
myself
time
to
recover
offered
him
my
watch
The
boy
stared
at
me
round-eyed
put
one
hand
before
his
mouth
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
being
scalded
and
held
out
the
other
Take
it
take
it
I
muttered
it
's
mine
I
give
it
you
you
can
sell
it
and
buy
yourself
something
you
want
Good-bye
I
thrust
the
watch
into
his
hand
and
went
home
at
a
gallop
Stopping
for
a
moment
at
the
door
of
our
common
bedroom
to
recover
my
breath
I
went
up
to
David
who
had
just
finished
dressing
and
was
combing
his
hair
Do
you
know
what
David
I
said
in
as
unconcerned
a
tone
as
I
could
I
have
given
away
Nastasey
's
watch
David
looked
at
me
and
passed
the
brush
over
his
temples
Yes
I
added
in
the
same
businesslike
voice
I
have
given
it
away
There
is
a
very
poor
boy
a
beggar
you
know
so
I
have
given
it
to
him
David
put
down
the
brush
on
the
washing-stand
He
can
buy
something
useful
I
went
on
with
the
money
he
can
get
for
it
Anyway
he
will
get
something
for
it
I
paused
Well
David
said
at
last
that
's
a
good
thing
and
he
went
off
to
the
schoolroom
I
followed
him
And
if
they
ask
you
what
you
have
done
with
it
he
said
turning
to
me
I
shall
tell
them
I
've
lost
it
I
answered
carelessly
No
more
was
said
about
the
watch
between
us
that
day
but
I
had
the
feeling
that
David
not
only
approved
of
what
I
had
done
but
was
to
some
extent
surprised
by
it
He
really
was
Two
days
more
passed
It
happened
that
no
one
in
the
house
thought
of
the
watch
My
father
was
taken
up
with
a
very
serious
unpleasantness
with
one
of
his
clients
he
had
no
attention
to
spare
for
me
or
my
watch
I
on
the
other
hand
thought
of
it
without
ceasing
Even
the
approval
the
presumed
approval
of
David
did
not
quite
comfort
me
He
did
not
show
it
in
any
special
way
the
only
thing
he
said
and
that
casually
was
that
he
had
n't
expected
such
recklessness
of
me
Certainly
I
was
a
loser
by
my
sacrifice
it
was
not
counter-balanced
by
the
gratification
afforded
me
by
my
vanity
And
what
is
more
as
ill-luck
would
have
it
another
schoolfellow
of
ours
the
son
of
the
town
doctor
must
needs
turn
up
and
begin
boasting
of
a
new
watch
a
present
from
his
grandmother
and
not
even
a
silver
but
a
pinch-back
one
I
could
not
bear
it
at
last
and
without
a
word
to
anyone
slipped
out
of
the
house
and
proceeded
to
hunt
for
the
beggar
boy
to
whom
I
had
given
my
watch
I
soon
found
him
he
was
playing
knucklebones
in
the
churchyard
with
some
other
boys
I
called
him
aside
and
breathless
and
stammering
told
him
that
my
family
were
angry
with
me
for
having
given
away
the
watch
and
that
if
he
would
consent
to
give
it
back
to
me
I
would
gladly
pay
him
for
it
To
be
ready
for
any
emergency
I
had
brought
with
me
an
old-fashioned
rouble
of
the
reign
of
Elizabeth
which
represented
the
whole
of
my
fortune
But
I
have
n't
got
it
your
watch
answered
the
boy
in
an
angry
and
tearful
voice
my
father
saw
it
and
took
it
away
from
me
and
he
was
for
thrashing
me
too
'You
must
have
stolen
it
from
somewhere
he
said
'What
fool
is
going
to
make
you
a
present
of
a
watch
And
who
is
your
father
My
father
Trofimitch
But
what
is
he
What
's
his
trade
He
is
an
old
soldier
a
sergeant
And
he
has
no
trade
at
all
He
mends
old
shoes
he
re-soles
them
That
's
all
his
trade
That
's
what
he
lives
by
Where
do
you
live
Take
me
to
him
To
be
sure
I
will
You
tell
my
father
that
you
gave
me
the
watch
For
he
keeps
pitching
into
me
and
calling
me
a
thief
And
my
mother
too
'Who
is
it
you
are
taking
after
she
says
'to
be
a
thief
I
set
off
with
the
boy
to
his
home
They
lived
in
a
smoky
hut
in
the
back-yard
of
a
factory
which
had
long
ago
been
burnt
down
and
not
rebuilt
We
found
both
Trofimitch
and
his
wife
at
home
The
discharged
sergeant
was
a
tall
old
man
erect
and
sinewy
with
yellowish
grey
whiskers
an
unshaven
chin
and
a
perfect
network
of
wrinkles
on
his
cheeks
and
forehead
His
wife
looked
older
than
he
Her
red
eyes
which
looked
buried
in
her
unhealthily
puffy
face
kept
blinking
dejectedly
Some
sort
of
dark
rags
hung
about
them
by
way
of
clothes
I
explained
to
Trofimitch
what
I
wanted
and
why
I
had
come
He
listened
to
me
in
silence
without
once
winking
or
moving
from
me
his
stupid
and
strained
typically
soldierly
eyes
Whims
and
fancies
he
brought
out
at
last
in
a
husky
toothless
bass
Is
that
the
way
gentlemen
behave
And
if
Petka
really
did
not
steal
the
watch
then
I
'll
give
him
one
for
that
To
teach
him
not
to
play
the
fool
with
little
gentlemen
And
if
he
did
steal
it
then
I
would
give
it
to
him
in
a
very
different
style
whack
whack
whack
With
the
flat
of
a
sword
in
horseguard
's
fashion
No
need
to
think
twice
about
it
What
's
the
meaning
of
it
Eh
Go
for
them
with
sabres
Here
's
a
nice
business
Tfoo
This
last
interjection
Trofimitch
pronounced
in
a
falsetto
He
was
obviously
perplexed
If
you
are
willing
to
restore
the
watch
to
me
I
explained
to
him
I
did
not
dare
to
address
him
familiarly
in
spite
of
his
being
a
soldier
I
will
with
pleasure
pay
you
this
rouble
here
The
watch
is
not
worth
more
I
imagine
Well
growled
Trofimitch
still
amazed
and
from
old
habit
devouring
me
with
his
eyes
as
though
I
were
his
superior
officer
It
's
a
queer
business
eh
Well
there
it
is
no
understanding
it
Ulyana
hold
your
tongue
he
snapped
out
at
his
wife
who
was
opening
her
mouth
Here
's
the
watch
he
added
opening
the
table
drawer
if
it
really
is
yours
take
it
by
all
means
but
what
's
the
rouble
for
Eh
Take
the
rouble
Trofimitch
you
senseless
man
wailed
his
wife
You
have
gone
crazy
in
your
old
age
We
have
not
a
half-rouble
between
us
and
then
you
stand
on
your
dignity
It
was
no
good
their
cutting
off
your
pigtail
you
are
a
regular
old
woman
just
the
same
How
can
you
go
on
like
that
when
you
know
nothing
about
it
Take
the
money
if
you
have
a
fancy
to
give
back
the
watch
Ulyana
hold
your
tongue
you
dirty
slut
Trofimitch
repeated
Whoever
heard
of
such
a
thing
talking
away
Eh
The
husband
is
the
head
and
yet
she
talks
Petka
do
n't
budge
I
'll
kill
you
Here's
the
watch
Trofimitch
held
out
the
watch
to
me
but
did
not
let
go
of
it
He
pondered
looked
down
then
fixed
the
same
intent
stupid
stare
upon
me
Then
all
at
once
bawled
at
the
top
of
his
voice
Where
is
it
Where
's
your
rouble
Here
it
is
here
it
is
I
responded
hurriedly
and
I
snatched
the
coin
out
of
my
pocket
But
he
did
not
take
it
he
still
stared
at
me
I
laid
the
rouble
on
the
table
He
suddenly
brushed
it
into
the
drawer
thrust
the
watch
into
my
hand
and
wheeling
to
the
left
with
a
loud
stamp
he
hissed
at
his
wife
and
his
son
Get
along
you
low
wretches
Ulyana
muttered
something
but
I
had
already
dashed
out
into
the
yard
and
into
the
street
Thrusting
the
watch
to
the
very
bottom
of
my
pocket
and
clutching
it
tightly
in
my
hand
I
hurried
home
I
had
regained
the
possession
of
my
watch
but
it
afforded
me
no
satisfaction
whatever
I
did
not
venture
to
wear
it
it
was
above
all
necessary
to
conceal
from
David
what
I
had
done
What
would
he
think
of
me
of
my
lack
of
will
I
could
not
even
lock
up
the
luckless
watch
in
a
drawer
we
had
all
our
drawers
in
common
I
had
to
hide
it
sometimes
on
the
top
of
the
cupboard
sometimes
under
my
mattress
sometimes
behind
the
stove
And
yet
I
did
not
succeed
in
hoodwinking
David
One
day
I
took
the
watch
from
under
a
plank
in
the
floor
of
our
room
and
proceeded
to
rub
the
silver
case
with
an
old
chamois
leather
glove
David
had
gone
off
somewhere
in
the
town
I
did
not
at
all
expect
him
to
be
back
quickly
Suddenly
he
was
in
the
doorway
I
was
so
overcome
that
I
almost
dropped
the
watch
and
utterly
disconcerted
my
face
painfully
flushing
crimson
I
fell
to
fumbling
about
my
waistcoat
with
it
unable
to
find
my
pocket
David
looked
at
me
and
as
usual
smiled
without
speaking
What
's
the
matter
he
brought
out
at
last
You
imagined
I
didn't
know
you
had
your
watch
again
I
saw
it
the
very
day
you
brought
it
back
I
assure
you
I
began
almost
on
the
point
of
tears
David
shrugged
his
shoulders
The
watch
is
yours
you
are
free
to
do
what
you
like
with
it
Saying
these
cruel
words
he
went
out
I
was
overwhelmed
with
despair
This
time
there
could
be
no
doubt
David
certainly
despised
me
I
could
not
leave
it
so
I
will
show
him
I
thought
clenching
my
teeth
and
at
once
with
a
firm
step
I
went
into
the
passage
found
our
page-boy
Yushka
and
presented
him
with
the
watch
Yushka
would
have
refused
it
but
I
declared
that
if
he
did
not
take
the
watch
from
me
I
would
smash
it
that
very
minute
trample
it
under
foot
break
it
to
bits
and
throw
it
in
the
cesspool
He
thought
a
moment
giggled
and
took
the
watch
I
went
back
to
our
room
and
seeing
David
reading
there
I
told
him
what
I
had
done
David
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
page
and
again
shrugging
his
shoulder
and
smiling
to
himself
repeated
that
the
watch
was
mine
and
that
I
was
free
to
do
what
I
liked
with
it
But
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
already
despised
me
a
little
less
I
was
fully
persuaded
that
I
should
never
again
expose
myself
to
the
reproach
of
weakness
of
character
for
the
watch
the
disgusting
present
from
my
disgusting
godfather
had
suddenly
grown
so
distasteful
to
me
that
I
was
quite
incapable
of
understanding
how
I
could
have
regretted
it
how
I
could
have
begged
for
it
back
from
the
wretched
Trofimitch
who
had
moreover
the
right
to
think
that
he
had
treated
me
with
generosity
Several
days
passed
I
remember
that
on
one
of
them
the
great
news
reached
our
town
that
the
Emperor
Paul
was
dead
and
his
son
Alexandr
of
whose
graciousness
and
humanity
there
were
such
favourable
rumours
had
ascended
the
throne
This
news
excited
David
intensely
the
possibility
of
seeing
of
shortly
seeing
his
father
occurred
to
him
at
once
My
father
was
delighted
too
They
will
bring
back
all
the
exiles
from
Siberia
now
and
I
expect
brother
Yegor
will
not
be
forgotten
he
kept
repeating
rubbing
his
hands
coughing
and
at
the
same
time
seeming
rather
nervous
David
and
I
at
once
gave
up
working
and
going
to
the
high
school
we
did
not
even
go
for
walks
but
sat
in
a
corner
counting
and
reckoning
in
how
many
months
in
how
many
weeks
in
how
many
days
brother
Yegor
ought
to
come
back
and
where
to
write
to
him
and
how
to
go
to
meet
him
and
in
what
way
we
should
begin
to
live
afterwards
Brother
Yegor
was
an
architect
David
and
I
decided
that
he
ought
to
settle
in
Moscow
and
there
build
big
schools
for
poor
people
and
we
would
go
to
be
his
assistants
The
watch
of
course
we
had
completely
forgotten
besides
David
had
new
cares
Of
them
I
will
speak
later
but
the
watch
was
destined
to
remind
us
of
its
existence
again
One
morning
we
had
only
just
finished
lunch
I
was
sitting
alone
by
the
window
thinking
of
my
uncle
's
release
outside
there
was
the
steam
and
glitter
of
an
April
thaw
when
all
at
once
my
aunt
Pelageya
Petrovna
walked
into
the
room
She
was
at
all
times
restless
and
fidgetty
she
spoke
in
a
shrill
voice
and
was
always
waving
her
arms
about
on
this
occasion
she
simply
pounced
on
me
Go
along
go
to
your
father
at
once
sir
she
snapped
out
What
pranks
have
you
been
up
to
you
shameless
boy
You
will
catch
it
both
of
you
Nastasey
Nastasyeitch
has
shown
up
all
your
tricks
Go
along
your
father
wants
you
Go
along
this
very
minute
Understanding
nothing
I
followed
my
aunt
and
as
I
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
drawing-room
I
saw
my
father
striding
up
and
down
and
ruffling
up
his
hair
Yushka
in
tears
by
the
door
and
sitting
on
a
chair
in
the
corner
my
godfather
Nastasey
Nastasyeitch
with
an
expression
of
peculiar
malignancy
in
his
distended
nostrils
and
in
his
fiery
slanting
eyes
My
father
swooped
down
upon
me
as
soon
as
I
walked
in
Did
you
give
your
watch
to
Yushka
Tell
me
I
glanced
at
Yushka
Tell
me
repeated
my
father
stamping
Yes
I
answered
and
immediately
received
a
stinging
slap
in
the
face
which
afforded
my
aunt
great
satisfaction
I
heard
her
gulp
as
though
she
had
swallowed
some
hot
tea
From
me
my
father
ran
to
Yushka
And
you
you
rascal
ought
not
to
have
dared
to
accept
such
a
present
he
said
pulling
him
by
the
hair
and
you
sold
it
too
you
good-for-nothing
boy
Yushka
as
I
learned
later
had
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
taken
my
watch
to
a
neighbouring
watchmaker
's
The
