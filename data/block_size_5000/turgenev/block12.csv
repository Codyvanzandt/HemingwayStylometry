should
have
jumped
on
purpose
I
shall
certainly
learn
But
the
watch
now
ah
But
at
that
moment
my
father
walked
with
a
majestic
step
into
our
room
You
my
fine
fellow
he
said
addressing
me
I
shall
certainly
whip
you
need
have
no
doubt
about
that
though
you
are
too
big
to
lie
on
the
bench
now
Then
he
went
up
to
the
bed
on
which
David
was
lying
In
Siberia
he
began
in
an
impressive
and
dignified
tone
in
Siberia
sir
in
penal
servitude
in
the
mines
there
are
people
living
and
dying
who
are
less
guilty
less
criminal
than
you
Are
you
a
suicide
or
simply
a
thief
or
altogether
a
fool
Be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
just
that
I
am
not
a
suicide
and
I
am
not
a
thief
answered
David
but
the
truth
's
the
truth
there
are
good
men
in
Siberia
better
than
you
or
I
who
should
know
that
if
not
you
My
father
gave
a
subdued
gasp
drew
back
a
step
looked
intently
at
David
spat
on
the
floor
and
slowly
crossing
himself
walked
away
Do
n't
you
like
that
David
called
after
him
and
put
his
tongue
out
Then
he
tried
to
get
up
but
could
not
I
must
have
hurt
myself
somehow
he
said
gasping
and
frowning
I
remember
the
water
dashed
me
against
a
post
Did
you
see
Raissa
he
added
suddenly
No
I
did
not
Stay
stay
stay
Now
I
remember
was
n't
it
she
standing
on
the
bank
by
the
bridge
Yes
yes
a
dark
dress
a
yellow
kerchief
on
her
head
yes
it
must
have
been
Raissa
Well
and
afterwards
Did
you
see
her
Afterwards
I
do
n't
know
I
had
no
thought
to
spare
for
her
You
jumped
in
David
was
suddenly
roused
Alyosha
darling
go
to
her
at
once
tell
her
I
am
all
right
that
there
's
nothing
the
matter
with
me
Tomorrow
I
shall
be
with
them
Go
as
quickly
as
you
can
brother
for
my
sake
David
held
out
both
hands
to
me
His
red
hair
by
now
dry
stuck
up
in
amusing
tufts
But
the
softened
expression
of
his
face
seemed
the
more
genuine
for
that
I
took
my
cap
and
went
out
of
the
house
trying
to
avoid
meeting
my
father
and
reminding
him
of
his
promise
Yes
indeed
I
reflected
as
I
walked
towards
the
Latkins
how
was
it
that
I
did
not
notice
Raissa
What
became
of
her
She
must
have
seen
And
all
at
once
I
remembered
that
the
very
moment
of
David
's
fall
a
terrible
piercing
shriek
had
rung
in
my
ears
Was
not
that
Raissa
But
how
was
it
I
did
not
see
her
afterwards
Before
the
little
house
in
which
Latkin
lodged
there
stretched
a
waste-ground
overgrown
with
nettles
and
surrounded
by
a
broken
hurdle
I
had
scarcely
clambered
over
the
hurdle
there
was
no
gate
anywhere
when
the
following
sight
met
my
eyes
Raissa
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
chin
propped
on
her
clasped
hands
was
sitting
on
the
lowest
step
in
front
of
the
house
she
was
looking
fixedly
straight
before
her
near
her
stood
her
little
dumb
sister
with
the
utmost
composure
brandishing
a
little
whip
while
facing
the
steps
with
his
back
to
me
old
Latkin
in
torn
and
shabby
drawers
and
high
felt
boots
was
trotting
and
prancing
up
and
down
capering
and
jerking
his
elbows
Hearing
my
footsteps
he
suddenly
turned
round
and
squatted
on
his
heels
then
at
once
skipping
up
to
me
began
speaking
very
rapidly
in
a
trembling
voice
incessantly
repeating
Tchoo
tchoo
tchoo
I
was
dumbfoundered
I
had
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
and
should
not
of
course
have
known
him
if
I
had
met
him
anywhere
else
That
red
wrinkled
toothless
face
those
lustreless
round
eyes
and
touzled
grey
hair
those
jerks
and
capers
that
senseless
halting
speech
What
did
it
mean
What
inhuman
despair
was
torturing
this
unhappy
creature
What
dance
of
death
was
this
Tchoo
tchoo
he
muttered
wriggling
incessantly
See
Vassilyevna
here
came
in
tchoo
tchoo
just
now
Do
you
hear
With
a
trough
on
the
roof
he
slapped
himself
on
the
head
with
his
hand
and
there
she
sits
like
a
spade
and
she
is
cross-eyed
cross-eyed
like
Andryushka
Vassilyevna
is
cross-eyed
he
probably
meant
to
say
dumb
tchoo
My
Vassilyevna
is
cross-eyed
They
are
both
on
the
same
cork
now
You
may
wonder
good
Christians
I
have
only
these
two
little
boats
Eh
Latkin
was
evidently
conscious
that
he
was
not
saying
the
right
thing
and
made
terrible
efforts
to
explain
to
me
what
was
the
matter
Raissa
did
not
seem
to
hear
what
her
father
was
saying
and
the
little
sister
went
on
lashing
the
whip
Good-bye
diamond-merchant
good-bye
good-bye
Latkin
drawled
several
times
in
succession
making
a
low
bow
seeming
delighted
at
having
at
last
got
hold
of
an
intelligible
word
My
head
began
to
go
round
What
does
it
all
mean
I
asked
of
an
old
woman
who
was
looking
out
of
the
window
of
the
little
house
Well
my
good
gentleman
she
answered
in
a
sing-song
voice
they
say
some
man
the
Lord
only
knows
who
went
and
drowned
himself
and
she
saw
it
Well
it
gave
her
a
fright
or
something
when
she
came
home
she
seemed
all
right
though
but
when
she
sat
down
on
the
step
here
she
has
been
sitting
ever
since
like
an
image
it
's
no
good
talking
to
her
I
suppose
she
has
lost
her
speech
too
Oh
dear
Oh
dear
Good-bye
good-bye
Latkin
kept
repeating
still
with
the
same
bow
I
went
up
to
Raissa
and
stood
directly
facing
her
Raissa
dear
what
's
the
matter
with
you
She
made
no
answer
she
seemed
not
to
notice
me
Her
face
had
not
grown
pale
had
not
changed
but
had
turned
somehow
stony
and
there
was
a
look
in
it
as
though
she
were
just
falling
asleep
She
is
cross-eyed
cross-eyed
Latkin
muttered
in
my
ear
I
took
Raissa
by
the
hand
David
is
alive
I
cried
more
loudly
than
before
Alive
and
well
David
's
alive
do
you
understand
He
was
pulled
out
of
the
water
he
is
at
home
now
and
told
me
to
say
that
he
will
come
to
you
to-morrow
he
is
alive
As
it
were
with
effort
Raissa
turned
her
eyes
on
me
she
blinked
several
times
opening
them
wider
and
wider
then
leaned
her
head
on
one
side
and
flushed
slightly
all
over
while
her
lips
parted
she
slowly
drew
in
a
deep
breath
winced
as
though
in
pain
and
with
fearful
effort
articulated
Da
Dav
a
alive
got
up
impulsively
and
rushed
away
Where
are
you
going
I
exclaimed
But
with
a
faint
laugh
she
ran
staggering
across
the
waste-ground
I
of
course
followed
her
while
behind
me
a
wail
rose
up
in
unison
from
the
old
man
and
the
child
Raissa
darted
straight
to
our
house
Here
's
a
day
I
thought
trying
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
black
dress
that
was
fluttering
before
me
Well
Passing
Vassily
my
aunt
and
even
Trankvillitatin
Raissa
ran
into
the
room
where
David
was
lying
and
threw
herself
on
his
neck
Oh
oh
Da
vidushka
her
voice
rang
out
from
under
her
loose
curls
oh
Flinging
wide
his
arms
David
embraced
her
and
nestled
his
head
against
her
Forgive
me
my
heart
I
heard
his
voice
saying
And
both
seemed
swooning
with
joy
But
why
did
you
go
home
Raissa
why
did
n't
you
stay
I
said
to
her
She
still
kept
her
head
bowed
You
would
have
seen
that
he
was
saved
Ah
I
do
n't
know
Ah
I
do
n't
know
Do
n't
ask
I
do
n't
know
I
don't
remember
how
I
got
home
I
only
remember
I
saw
you
in
the
air
something
seemed
to
strike
me
and
what
happened
afterwards
Seemed
to
strike
you
repeated
David
and
we
all
three
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
together
We
were
very
happy
What
may
be
the
meaning
of
this
may
I
ask
we
heard
behind
us
a
threatening
voice
the
voice
of
my
father
He
was
standing
in
the
doorway
Will
there
ever
be
an
end
to
these
fooleries
Where
are
we
living
Are
we
in
the
Russian
Empire
or
the
French
Republic
He
came
into
the
room
Anyone
who
wants
to
be
rebellious
and
immoral
had
better
go
to
France
And
how
dare
you
come
here
he
said
turning
to
Raissa
who
quietly
sitting
up
and
turning
to
face
him
was
evidently
taken
aback
but
still
smiled
as
before
a
friendly
and
blissful
smile
The
daughter
of
my
sworn
enemy
How
dare
you
And
hugging
him
too
Away
with
you
at
once
or
Uncle
David
brought
out
and
he
sat
up
in
bed
Do
n't
insult
Raissa
She
is
going
away
only
do
n't
insult
her
And
who
are
you
to
teach
me
I
am
not
insulting
her
I
am
not
in
sul
ting
her
I
am
simply
turning
her
out
of
the
house
I
have
an
account
to
settle
with
you
too
presently
You
have
made
away
with
other
people
's
property
have
attempted
to
take
your
own
life
have
put
me
to
expense
To
what
expense
David
interrupted
What
expense
You
have
ruined
your
clothes
Do
you
count
that
as
nothing
And
I
had
to
tip
the
men
who
brought
you
You
have
given
the
whole
family
a
fright
and
are
you
going
to
be
unruly
now
And
if
this
young
woman
regardless
of
shame
and
honour
itself
David
made
a
dash
as
though
to
get
out
of
bed
Do
n't
insult
her
I
tell
you
Hold
your
tongue
Do
n't
dare
Hold
your
tongue
Do
n't
dare
to
insult
my
betrothed
cried
David
at
the
top
of
his
voice
my
future
wife
Betrothed
repeated
my
father
with
round
eyes
Betrothed
Wife
Ho
ho
ho
Ha
ha
ha
my
aunt
echoed
behind
the
door
Why
how
old
are
you
He
's
been
no
time
in
the
world
the
milk
is
hardly
dry
on
his
lips
he
is
a
mere
babe
and
he
is
going
to
be
married
But
I
but
you
Let
me
go
let
me
go
whispered
Raissa
and
she
made
for
the
door
She
looked
more
dead
than
alive
I
am
not
going
to
ask
permission
of
you
David
went
on
shouting
propping
himself
up
with
his
fists
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
but
of
my
own
father
who
is
bound
to
be
here
one
day
soon
he
is
a
law
to
me
but
you
are
not
but
as
for
my
age
if
Raissa
and
I
are
not
old
enough
we
will
bide
our
time
whatever
you
may
say
Ai
ai
Davidka
do
n't
forget
yourself
my
father
interrupted
Just
look
at
yourself
You
are
not
fit
to
be
seen
You
have
lost
all
sense
of
decency
David
put
his
hand
to
the
front
of
his
shirt
Whatever
you
may
say
he
repeated
Oh
shut
his
mouth
Porfiry
Petrovitch
piped
my
aunt
from
behind
the
door
shut
his
mouth
and
as
for
this
hussy
this
baggage
this
But
something
extraordinary
must
have
cut
short
my
aunt
's
eloquence
at
that
moment
her
voice
suddenly
broke
off
and
in
its
place
we
heard
another
feeble
and
husky
with
old
age
Brother
this
weak
voice
articulated
Christian
soul
We
all
turned
round
In
the
same
costume
in
which
I
had
just
seen
him
thin
pitiful
and
wild
looking
Latkin
stood
before
us
like
an
apparition
God
he
pronounced
in
a
sort
of
childish
way
pointing
upwards
with
a
bent
and
trembling
finger
and
gazing
impotently
at
my
father
God
has
chastised
me
but
I
have
come
for
Va
for
Ra
yes
yes
for
Raissotchka
What
tchoo
what
is
there
for
me
Soon
underground
and
what
do
you
call
it
One
little
stick
another
cross-beam
that
's
what
I
want
but
you
brother
diamond-merchant
mind
I
'm
a
man
too
Raissa
crossed
the
room
without
a
word
and
taking
his
arm
buttoned
his
vest
Let
us
go
Vassilyevna
he
said
they
are
all
saints
here
don't
come
to
them
and
he
lying
there
in
his
case
he
pointed
to
David
is
a
saint
too
but
you
and
I
are
sinners
brother
Come
Tchoo
Forgive
an
old
man
with
a
pepper
pot
gentleman
We
have
stolen
together
he
shouted
suddenly
stolen
together
stolen
together
he
repeated
with
evident
satisfaction
that
his
tongue
had
obeyed
him
at
last
Everyone
in
the
room
was
silent
And
where
is
the
ikon
here
he
asked
throwing
back
his
head
and
turning
up
his
eyes
we
must
cleanse
ourselves
a
bit
He
fell
to
praying
to
one
of
the
corners
crossing
himself
fervently
several
times
in
succession
tapping
first
one
shoulder
and
then
the
other
with
his
fingers
and
hurriedly
repeating
Have
mercy
me
oh
Lor
me
oh
Lor
me
oh
Lor
My
father
who
had
not
taken
his
eyes
off
Latkin
and
had
not
uttered
a
word
suddenly
started
stood
beside
him
and
began
crossing
himself
too
Then
he
turned
to
him
bowed
very
low
so
that
he
touched
the
floor
with
one
hand
saying
You
forgive
me
too
Martinyan
Gavrilitch
kissed
him
on
the
shoulder
Latkin
in
response
smacked
his
lips
in
the
air
and
blinked
I
doubt
whether
he
quite
knew
what
he
was
doing
Then
my
father
turned
to
everyone
in
the
room
to
David
to
Raissa
and
to
me
Do
as
you
like
act
as
you
think
best
he
brought
out
in
a
soft
and
mournful
voice
and
he
withdrew
My
aunt
was
running
up
to
him
but
he
cried
out
sharply
and
gruffly
to
her
He
was
overwhelmed
Me
oh
Lor
me
oh
Lor
mercy
Latkin
repeated
I
am
a
man
Good-bye
Davidushka
said
Raissa
and
she
too
went
out
of
the
room
with
the
old
man
I
will
be
with
you
tomorrow
David
called
after
her
and
turning
his
face
to
the
wall
he
whispered
I
am
very
tired
it
will
be
as
well
to
have
some
sleep
now
and
was
quiet
It
was
a
long
while
before
I
went
out
of
the
room
I
kept
in
hiding
I
could
not
forget
my
father
's
threats
But
my
apprehensions
turned
out
to
be
unnecessary
He
met
me
and
did
not
utter
a
word
He
seemed
to
feel
awkward
himself
But
night
soon
came
on
and
everything
was
quiet
in
the
house
Next
morning
David
got
up
as
though
nothing
were
the
matter
and
not
long
after
on
the
same
day
two
important
events
occurred
in
the
morning
old
Latkin
died
and
towards
evening
my
uncle
Yegor
David's
father
arrived
in
Ryazan
Without
sending
any
letter
in
advance
without
warning
anyone
he
descended
on
us
like
snow
on
our
heads
My
father
was
completely
taken
aback
and
did
not
know
what
to
offer
to
his
dear
guest
and
where
to
make
him
sit
He
rushed
about
as
though
delirious
was
flustered
as
though
he
were
guilty
but
my
uncle
did
not
seem
to
be
much
touched
by
his
brother
's
fussy
solicitude
he
kept
repeating
What
's
this
for
or
I
do
n't
want
anything
His
manner
with
my
aunt
was
even
colder
she
had
no
great
liking
for
him
indeed
In
her
eyes
he
was
an
infidel
a
heretic
a
Voltairian
he
had
in
fact
learnt
French
to
read
Voltaire
in
the
original
I
found
my
Uncle
Yegor
just
as
David
had
described
him
He
was
a
big
heavy
man
with
a
broad
pock-marked
face
grave
and
serious
He
always
wore
a
hat
with
feathers
in
it
cuffs
a
frilled
shirt
front
and
a
snuff-coloured
vest
and
a
sword
at
his
side
David
was
unspeakably
delighted
to
see
him
he
actually
looked
brighter
in
the
face
and
better
looking
and
his
eyes
looked
different
merrier
keener
more
shining
but
he
did
his
utmost
to
moderate
his
joy
and
not
to
show
it
in
words
he
was
afraid
of
being
too
soft
The
first
night
after
Uncle
Yegor
's
arrival
father
and
son
shut
themselves
up
in
the
room
that
had
been
assigned
to
my
uncle
and
spent
a
long
time
talking
together
in
a
low
voice
next
morning
I
saw
that
my
uncle
looked
particularly
affectionately
and
trustfully
at
his
son
he
seemed
very
much
pleased
with
him
David
took
him
to
the
requiem
service
for
Latkin
I
went
to
it
too
my
father
did
not
hinder
my
going
but
remained
at
home
himself
Raissa
impressed
me
by
her
calm
she
looked
pale
and
much
thinner
but
did
not
shed
tears
and
spoke
and
behaved
with
perfect
simplicity
and
with
all
that
strange
to
say
I
saw
a
certain
grandeur
in
her
the
unconscious
grandeur
of
sorrow
forgetful
of
itself
Uncle
Yegor
made
her
acquaintance
on
the
spot
in
the
church
porch
from
his
manner
to
her
it
was
evident
that
David
had
already
spoken
of
her
He
was
as
pleased
with
her
as
with
his
son
I
could
read
that
in
David
's
eyes
when
he
looked
at
them
both
I
remember
how
his
eyes
sparkled
when
his
father
said
speaking
of
her
She
's
a
clever
girl
she
'll
make
a
capable
woman
At
the
Latkins
I
was
told
that
the
old
man
had
quietly
expired
like
a
candle
that
has
burnt
out
and
that
until
he
had
lost
power
and
consciousness
he
kept
stroking
his
daughter
's
head
and
saying
something
unintelligible
but
not
gloomy
and
he
was
smiling
to
the
end
My
father
went
to
the
funeral
and
to
the
service
in
the
church
and
prayed
very
devoutly
Trankvillitatin
actually
sang
in
the
choir
Beside
the
grave
Raissa
suddenly
broke
into
sobs
and
sank
forward
on
the
ground
but
she
soon
recovered
herself
Her
little
deaf
and
dumb
sister
stared
at
everyone
and
everything
with
big
bright
rather
wild-looking
eyes
from
time
to
time
she
huddled
up
to
Raissa
but
there
was
no
sign
of
terror
about
her
The
day
after
the
funeral
Uncle
Yegor
who
judging
from
appearances
had
not
come
back
from
Siberia
with
empty
hands
he
paid
for
the
funeral
and
liberally
rewarded
David
's
rescuer
but
who
told
us
nothing
of
his
doings
there
or
of
his
plans
for
the
future
Uncle
Yegor
suddenly
informed
my
father
that
he
did
not
intend
to
remain
in
Ryazan
but
was
going
to
Moscow
with
his
son
My
father
from
a
feeling
of
propriety
expressed
regret
and
even
tried
very
faintly
it
is
true
to
induce
my
uncle
to
alter
his
decision
but
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
I
think
he
was
really
much
relieved
The
presence
of
his
brother
with
whom
he
had
very
little
in
common
who
did
not
even
condescend
to
reproach
him
whose
feeling
for
him
was
more
one
of
simple
disgust
than
disdain
oppressed
him
and
parting
with
David
could
not
have
caused
him
much
regret
I
of
course
was
utterly
crushed
by
the
separation
I
was
utterly
desolate
at
first
and
lost
all
support
in
life
and
all
interest
in
it
And
so
my
uncle
went
away
and
took
with
him
not
only
David
but
to
the
great
astonishment
and
even
indignation
of
our
whole
street
Raissa
and
her
little
sister
too
When
she
heard
of
this
my
aunt
promptly
called
him
a
Turk
and
called
him
a
Turk
to
the
end
of
her
days
And
I
was
left
alone
alone
but
this
story
is
not
about
me
So
this
is
the
end
of
my
tale
of
the
watch
What
more
have
I
to
tell
you
Five
years
after
David
was
married
to
his
Black-lip
and
in
1812
as
a
lieutenant
of
artillery
he
died
a
glorious
death
on
the
battlefield
of
Borodino
in
defence
of
the
Shevardinsky
redoubt
Much
water
has
flowed
by
since
then
and
I
have
had
many
watches
I
have
even
attained
the
dignity
of
a
real
repeater
with
a
second
hand
and
the
days
of
the
week
on
it
But
in
a
secret
drawer
of
my
writing
table
there
is
preserved
an
old-fashioned
silver
watch
with
a
rose
on
the
face
I
bought
it
from
a
Jewish
pedlar
struck
by
its
likeness
to
the
watch
which
was
once
presented
to
me
by
my
godfather
From
time
to
time
when
I
am
alone
and
expect
no
one
I
take
it
out
of
the
drawer
and
looking
at
it
remember
my
young
days
and
the
companion
of
those
days
that
have
fled
never
to
return
Paris
1875
INTRODUCTION
In
this
masterly
unromantic
novel
Turgenev
drew
a
character
Bazarov
who
served
to
express
what
he
taught
us
to
call
Nihilism
and
made
a
movement
into
a
man
In
Russia
itself
the
effect
of
the
story
was
astonishing
The
portrait
of
Bazarov
was
immediately
and
angrily
resented
as
a
cold
travesty
The
portraits
of
the
backwoodsmen
or
retired
aristocrats
fared
no
better
Turgenev
had
indeed
roused
the
ire
of
both
sides
only
too
surely
The
Petrovitchs
typical
figures
as
he
designed
them
of
the
Russian
nobility
were
intended
he
confessed
to
breathe
feebleness
nonchalance
narrowness
of
mind
His
sense
of
fitness
made
him
paint
with
extreme
care
these
choice
representatives
of
their
class
They
were
the
pick
and
if
they
were
humanly
ineffective
what
of
their
weaker
kind
Si
la
crême
est
mauvaise
que
sera
le
lait
as
he
put
it
The
bitterest
criticism
came
however
from
the
side
of
the
revolutionaries
and
incompatibles
They
felt
in
Turgenev
the
sharper
artistry
and
the
intimate
irony
as
if
he
had
only
used
these
qualities
in
dealing
with
the
specific
case
of
Bazarov
whereas
they
were
temperamental
effects
of
his
narrative
art
He
was
ready
to
assert
himself
one
of
the
party
of
youth
He
was
at
one
with
Bazarov
he
declared
in
nearly
all
his
ideas
a
chief
exception
being
Bazarov's
ideas
on
art
which
in
truth
are
apt
to
be
more
crudely
delivered
than
the
rest
of
that
iconoclast
's
destructive
opinions
Bazarov
he
said
once
and
again
was
his
favourite
child
It
is
nearly
forty
years
now
in
1921
since
the
novel
appeared
in
The
Russian
Messenger
a
weekly
which
was
the
recognised
exponent
of
the
new
movement
That
proverbial
period
has
lent
a
softer
cast
to
the
lineaments
of
the
people
in
the
group
as
time
touches
the
canvas
of
the
pictures
in
an
old
country-house
gallery
But
the
interesting
thing
is
to
find
that
history
in
the
large
has
terribly
and
irresistibly
confirmed
the
history
in
little
that
Turgenev
drew
with
a
sure
instinct
for
the
potential
anticipations
of
his
saga
But
we
should
be
wrong
if
we
mistook
its
clear
pervading
realities
for
those
of
a
tract-novel
or
a
document
of
any
one
particular
generation
It
is
as
its
title
declares
in
a
sense
another
fable
of
the
inevitable
coil
and
recoil
of
the
two
generations
The
sympathetic
power
of
Turgenev
is
shown
in
his
instinctive
understanding
of
them
both
An
aristocrat
by
training
he
was
saved
as
Tolstoi
was
from
sterilising
his
imaginative
and
dramatic
powers
by
any
sense
of
caste
and
privilege
He
loved
the
play
of
human
nature
knew
how
to
reckon
with
its
foibles
its
pride
habitual
prejudices
and
all
tragic
and
comic
susceptibilities
So
he
drew
Bazarov
as
a
protagonist
of
the
revolt
against
the
old
order
and
the
protective
habit
of
age
When
Bazarov
enters
the
house
of
Arkady
's
father
he
is
like
Don
Quixote
entering
the
inn
of
his
direst
probation
If
the
parallel
seems
a
trifle
fantastic
it
was
yet
one
that
Turgenev
would
let
pass
since
he
affirmed
that
Don
Quixote
himself
was
in
his
inimitable
extravagance
a
type
of
the
eternal
spirit
of
revolution
And
one
would
like
if
there
were
room
for
it
to
print
as
preamble
to
Fathers
and
Sons
the
essay
in
which
its
writer
has
compared
the
deeper
essentials
of
Hamlet
and
Quixote
We
must
be
satisfied
instead
to
recall
the
direct
event
of
the
novel
as
it
falls
in
his
own
record
The
present
writer
some
years
ago
spent
a
spring
at
Ventnor
in
the
Isle
of
Wight
and
found
the
house
on
the
sea-brink
in
which
he
stayed
had
been
occupied
by
Turgenev
at
one
time
Then
and
there
it
was
in
1860
and
at
Ventnor
that
he
had
the
first
idea
of
this
novel
and
it
is
scarcely
being
too
fanciful
to
think
that
he
imagined
the
home
environment
and
the
spacious
vista
of
the
Russian
provinces
more
fondly
and
more
freely
because
of
his
being
at
a
long
remove
from
them
in
that
small
and
confined
seaside
nook
of
Ventnor
Already
we
must
remember
the
liberation
of
the
serf
had
taken
place
and
the
ferment
of
liberal
ideas
was
working
in
the
new
generation
As
we
look
back
we
see
in
our
wisdom
after
the
event
having
realised
Turgenev
for
the
novelist
he
was
an
artist
who
was
for
ever
adjusting
the
moment
to
the
permanent
in
art
that
it
was
inevitable
he
should
write
this
book
this
tragi-comedy
of
age
and
youth
of
the
old
order
and
the
new
the
conservating
fathers
and
the
revolutionary
sons

Can

asked
a
barin
1
of
about
forty
who
hatless
and
clad
in
a
dusty
jacket
over
a
pair
of
tweed
breeches
stepped
on
to
the
verandah
of
a
posting-house
on
the
20th
day
of
May
1859
The
person
addressed
was
the
barin's
servant
a
round-cheeked
young
fellow
with
small
dull
eyes
and
a
chin
adorned
with
a
tuft
of
pale-coloured
down
Glancing
along
the
high
road
in
a
supercilious
manner
the
servant
in
whom
everything
from
the
turquoise
ear-ring
to
the
dyed
pomaded
hair
and
the
mincing
gait
revealed
the
modern
the
rising
generation
replied
No
barin
I
can
not
Is
that
so
queried
the
barin
Yes
the
servant
affirmed
The
barin
sighed
and
seated
himself
upon
a
bench
While
he
is
sitting
there
with
his
knees
drawn
under
him
and
his
eyes
moodily
glancing
to
right
and
left
the
reader
may
care
to
become
better
acquainted
with
his
personality
His
name
was
Nikolai
Petrovitch
Kirsanov
and
he
owned
some
fifteen
versts
from
the
posting-house
a
respectable
little
property
of
about
two
hundred
souls
or
as
after
that
he
had
apportioned
his
peasantry
allotments
and
set
up
a
farm
he
himself
expressed
it
a
property
of
two
thousand
desiatini
2
His
father
one
of
the
generals
of
1812
had
spent
his
life
exclusively
in
military
service
as
the
commander
first
of
a
brigade
and
then
of
a
division
and
always
he
had
been
quartered
in
the
provinces
where
his
rank
had
enabled
him
to
cut
a
not
inconspicuous
figure
As
for
Nikolai
Petrovitch
himself
he
was
born
in
Southern
Russia
as
also
was
his
elder
brother
Paul
of
whom
presently
and
until
his
fourteenth
year
received
his
education
amid
a
circle
of
hard-up
governors
free-and-easy
aides-de-camp
and
sundry
staff
and
regimental
officers
His
mother
came
of
the
family
of
the
Koliazins
and
known
in
maidenhood
as
Agathe
and
subsequently
as
Agathoklea
Kuzminishna
Kirsanov
belonged
to
the
type
of
officer's
lady
That
is
to
say
she
wore
pompous
mobcaps
and
rustling
silk
dresses
was
always
the
first
to
approach
the
cross
in
church
talked
volubly
and
in
a
loud
tone
of
set
practice
admitted
her
sons
to
kiss
her
hand
in
the
morning
and
never
failed
to
bless
them
before
retiring
to
rest
at
night
In
short
she
lived
the
life
which
suited
her
As
the
son
of
a
general
Nikolai
Petrovitch
was
bound
though
he
evinced
no
particular
bravery
and
might
even
have
seemed
a
coward
to
follow
his
brother
Paul
's
example
by
entering
the
army
but
unfortunately
owing
to
the
fact
that
on
the
very
day
when
there
arrived
the
news
of
his
commission
he
happened
to
break
his
leg
it
befell
that
after
two
months
in
bed
