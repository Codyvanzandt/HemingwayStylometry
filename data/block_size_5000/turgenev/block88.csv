of
a
child
clear
common-sense
and
an
innate
feeling
for
beauty
a
continual
striving
towards
the
true
and
the
lofty
and
a
comprehension
of
everything
even
of
the
vicious
even
of
the
ridiculous
a
soft
womanly
charm
brooding
over
all
this
like
an
angel
s
white
wings
But
what
s
the
use
of
words
We
have
read
a
great
deal
we
have
talked
a
great
deal
together
during
this
month
Reading
with
her
is
a
delight
such
as
I
had
never
experienced
before
You
seem
to
be
discovering
new
worlds
She
never
goes
into
ecstasies
over
anything
anything
boisterous
is
distasteful
to
her
she
is
softly
radiant
all
over
when
she
likes
anything
and
her
face
wears
such
a
noble
and
good
yes
good
expression
From
her
earliest
childhood
Vera
has
not
known
what
deceit
was
she
is
accustomed
to
truth
it
is
the
breath
of
her
being
and
so
in
poetry
too
only
what
is
true
strikes
her
as
natural
at
once
without
effort
or
difficulty
she
recognises
it
as
a
familiar
face
a
great
privilege
and
happiness
One
must
give
her
mother
credit
for
it
How
many
times
have
I
thought
as
I
watched
Vera
yes
Goethe
was
right
the
good
even
in
their
obscure
striving
feel
always
where
the
true
path
lies
There
is
only
one
thing
annoying
her
husband
is
always
about
the
place
Please
don
t
laugh
a
senseless
guffaw
don
t
sully
our
pure
friendship
even
in
thought
He
is
about
as
capable
of
understanding
poetry
as
I
am
of
playing
the
flute
but
he
does
not
like
to
lag
behind
his
wife
he
wants
to
improve
himself
too
Sometimes
she
puts
me
out
of
patience
herself
all
of
a
sudden
a
mood
comes
over
her
she
won
t
read
or
talk
she
works
at
her
embroidery
frame
busies
herself
with
Natasha
or
with
the
housekeeper
runs
off
all
at
once
into
the
kitchen
or
simply
sits
with
her
hands
folded
looking
out
of
the
window
or
sets
to
playing
fools
with
the
nurse
I
have
noticed
at
these
times
it
doesn
t
do
to
bother
her
it
s
better
to
bide
one
s
time
till
she
comes
up
begins
to
talk
or
takes
up
a
book
She
has
a
great
deal
of
independence
and
I
am
very
glad
of
it
In
the
days
of
our
youth
do
you
remember
young
girls
would
sometimes
repeat
one
s
own
words
to
one
as
they
so
well
knew
how
and
one
would
be
in
ecstasies
over
the
echo
and
possibly
quite
impressed
by
it
till
one
realised
what
it
meant
but
this
woman
s
not
so
she
thinks
for
herself
She
takes
nothing
on
trust
there
s
no
overawing
her
with
authority
she
won
t
begin
arguing
but
she
won
t
give
in
either
We
have
discussed
Faust
more
than
once
but
strange
to
say
Gretchen
she
never
speaks
of
herself
she
only
listens
to
what
I
say
of
her
Mephistopheles
terrifies
her
not
as
the
devil
but
as
something
which
may
exist
in
every
man
These
are
her
own
words
I
began
trying
to
convince
her
that
this
something
is
what
we
call
reflection
but
she
does
not
understand
the
word
reflection
in
its
German
sense
she
only
knows
the
French
refl
xion
and
is
accustomed
to
regarding
it
as
useful
Our
relations
are
marvellous
From
a
certain
point
of
view
I
can
say
that
I
have
a
great
influence
over
her
and
am
as
it
were
educating
her
but
she
too
though
she
is
unaware
of
it
herself
is
changing
me
for
the
better
in
many
ways
It
s
only
lately
for
instance
thanks
to
her
that
I
have
discovered
what
an
immense
amount
of
conventional
rhetorical
stuff
there
is
in
many
fine
and
celebrated
poetical
works
What
leaves
her
cold
is
at
once
suspect
in
my
eyes
Yes
I
have
grown
better
serener
One
can
t
be
near
her
see
her
and
remain
the
man
one
was
What
will
come
of
all
this
you
ask
I
really
believe
nothing
I
shall
pass
my
time
very
delightfully
till
September
and
then
go
away
Life
will
seem
dark
and
dreary
to
me
for
the
first
months
I
shall
get
used
to
it
I
know
how
full
of
danger
is
any
tie
whatever
between
a
man
and
a
young
woman
how
imperceptibly
one
feeling
passes
into
another
I
should
have
had
the
strength
to
break
it
off
if
I
had
not
been
sure
that
we
were
both
perfectly
undisturbed
It
is
true
one
day
something
queer
passed
between
us
I
don
t
know
how
or
from
what
I
remember
we
had
been
reading
Oniegin
I
kissed
her
hand
She
turned
a
little
away
bent
her
eyes
upon
me
I
have
never
seen
such
a
look
except
in
her
there
is
dreaminess
and
intent
attention
in
it
and
a
sort
of
sternness
suddenly
flushed
got
up
and
went
away
I
did
not
succeed
in
being
alone
with
her
that
day
She
avoided
me
and
for
four
mortal
hours
she
played
cards
with
her
husband
the
nurse
and
the
governess
Next
morning
she
proposed
a
walk
in
the
garden
to
me
We
walked
all
through
it
down
to
the
lake
Suddenly
without
turning
towards
me
she
softly
whispered
Please
don
t
do
that
again
and
instantly
began
telling
me
about
something
else
I
was
very
much
ashamed
I
must
admit
that
her
image
is
never
out
of
my
mind
and
indeed
I
may
almost
say
I
have
begun
writing
a
letter
to
you
with
the
object
of
having
a
reason
for
thinking
and
talking
about
her
I
hear
the
tramp
and
neighing
of
horses
it
s
my
carriage
being
got
ready
I
am
going
to
see
them
My
coachman
has
given
up
asking
me
where
to
drive
to
when
I
get
into
my
carriage
he
takes
me
straight
off
to
the
Priemkovs
A
mile
and
a
half
from
their
village
at
an
abrupt
turn
in
the
road
their
house
suddenly
peeps
out
from
behind
a
birch
copse
Each
time
I
feel
a
thrill
of
joy
in
my
heart
directly
I
catch
the
glimmer
of
its
windows
in
the
distance
Schimmel
the
harmless
old
man
comes
to
see
them
from
time
to
time
the
princes
H
thank
God
have
only
called
once
Schimmel
with
the
modest
solemnity
characteristic
of
him
said
very
aptly
pointing
to
the
house
where
Vera
lives
That
is
the
abode
of
peace
In
that
house
dwells
an
angel
of
peace
Cover
me
with
thy
wing
Still
the
throbbing
of
my
heart
And
grateful
will
be
the
shade
To
the
enraptured
soul
But
enough
of
this
or
you
ll
be
fancying
all
sorts
of
things
Till
next
time
What
shall
I
write
to
you
next
time
I
wonder
Good-bye
By
the
way
she
never
says
Good-bye
but
always
So
good-bye
I
like
that
tremendously
Yours
P
B
P.S
I
can
t
recollect
whether
I
told
you
that
she
knows
I
wanted
to
marry
her
SIXTH
LETTER
From
the
SAME
to
the
SAME
M
VILLAGE
August
10
1850
Confess
you
are
expecting
a
letter
from
me
of
despair
or
of
rapture
Nothing
of
the
sort
My
letter
will
be
like
any
other
letter
Nothing
new
has
happened
and
nothing
I
imagine
possibly
can
happen
The
other
day
we
went
out
in
a
boat
on
the
lake
I
will
tell
you
about
this
boating
expedition
We
were
three
she
Schimmel
and
I
I
don
t
know
what
induces
her
to
invite
the
old
fellow
so
often
The
H
s
I
hear
are
annoyed
with
him
for
neglecting
his
lessons
This
time
though
he
was
entertaining
Priemkov
did
not
come
with
us
he
had
a
headache
The
weather
was
splendid
brilliant
great
white
clouds
that
seemed
torn
to
shreds
over
a
blue
sky
everywhere
glitter
a
rustle
in
the
trees
the
plash
and
lapping
of
water
on
the
bank
running
coils
of
gold
on
the
waves
freshness
and
sunlight
At
first
the
German
and
I
rowed
then
we
hoisted
a
sail
and
flew
before
the
wind
The
boat
s
bow
almost
dipped
in
the
water
and
a
constant
hissing
and
foaming
followed
the
helm
She
sat
at
the
rudder
and
steered
she
tied
a
kerchief
over
her
head
she
could
not
have
kept
a
hat
on
her
curls
strayed
from
under
it
and
fluttered
in
the
air
She
held
the
rudder
firmly
in
her
little
sunburnt
hand
and
smiled
at
the
spray
which
flew
at
times
in
her
face
I
was
curled
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
not
far
from
her
feet
The
German
brought
out
a
pipe
smoked
his
shag
and
only
fancy
began
singing
in
a
rather
pleasing
bass
First
he
sang
the
old-fashioned
song
Freut
euch
des
Lebens
then
an
air
from
the
Magic
Flute
then
a
song
called
the
A
B
C
of
Love
In
this
song
all
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
with
additions
of
course
are
sung
through
in
order
beginning
with
A
B
C
D
Wenn
ich
dich
seh
and
ending
with
U
V
W
X
Mach
einen
Knicks
He
sang
all
the
couplets
with
much
expression
but
you
should
have
seen
how
slily
he
winked
with
his
left
eye
at
the
word
Knicks
Vera
laughed
and
shook
her
finger
at
him
I
observed
that
as
far
as
I
could
judge
Mr
Schimmel
had
been
a
redoubtable
fellow
in
his
day
Oh
yes
I
could
take
my
own
part
he
rejoined
with
dignity
and
he
knocked
the
ash
out
of
his
pipe
on
to
his
open
hand
and
with
a
knowing
air
held
the
mouth-piece
on
one
side
in
his
teeth
while
he
felt
in
the
tobacco-pouch
When
I
was
a
student
he
added
o-oh-oh
He
said
nothing
more
But
what
an
o-oh-oh
it
was
Vera
begged
him
to
sing
some
students
song
and
he
sang
her
Knaster
den
gelben
but
broke
down
on
the
last
note
Altogether
he
was
quite
jovial
and
expansive
Meanwhile
the
wind
had
blown
up
the
waves
began
to
be
rather
large
and
the
boat
heeled
a
little
over
on
one
side
swallows
began
flitting
above
the
water
all
about
us
We
made
the
sail
loose
and
began
to
tack
about
The
wind
suddenly
blew
a
cross
squall
we
had
not
time
to
right
the
sail
a
wave
splashed
over
the
boat
s
edge
and
flung
a
lot
of
water
into
the
boat
And
now
the
German
proved
himself
a
man
of
spirit
he
snatched
the
cord
from
me
and
set
the
sail
right
saying
as
he
did
so
So
macht
man
ins
Kuxhaven
Vera
was
most
likely
frightened
for
she
turned
pale
but
as
her
way
is
she
did
not
utter
a
word
but
picked
up
her
skirt
and
put
her
feet
upon
the
crosspiece
of
the
boat
I
was
suddenly
reminded
of
the
poem
of
Goethe
s
I
have
been
simply
steeped
in
him
for
some
time
past
you
remember
On
the
waves
glitter
a
thousand
dancing
stars
and
I
repeated
it
aloud
When
I
reached
the
line
My
eyes
why
do
you
look
down
she
slightly
raised
her
eyes
I
was
sitting
lower
than
she
her
gaze
had
rested
on
me
from
above
and
looked
a
long
while
away
into
the
distance
screwing
up
her
eyes
from
the
wind
A
light
rain
came
on
in
an
instant
and
pattered
making
bubbles
on
the
water
I
offered
her
my
overcoat
she
put
it
over
her
shoulders
We
got
to
the
bank
not
at
the
landing-place
and
walked
home
I
gave
her
my
arm
I
kept
feeling
that
I
wanted
to
tell
her
something
but
I
did
not
speak
I
asked
her
though
I
remember
why
she
always
sat
when
she
was
at
home
under
the
portrait
of
Madame
Eltsov
like
a
little
bird
under
its
mother
s
wing
Your
comparison
is
a
very
true
one
she
responded
I
never
want
to
come
out
from
under
her
wing
Shouldn
t
you
like
to
come
out
into
freedom
I
asked
again
She
made
no
answer
I
don
t
know
why
I
have
described
this
expedition
perhaps
because
it
has
remained
in
my
memory
as
one
of
the
brightest
events
of
the
past
days
though
in
reality
how
can
one
call
it
an
event
I
had
such
a
sense
of
comfort
and
unspeakable
gladness
of
heart
and
tears
light
happy
tears
were
on
the
point
of
bursting
from
my
eyes
Oh
fancy
the
next
day
as
I
was
walking
in
the
garden
by
the
arbour
I
suddenly
heard
a
pleasing
musical
woman
s
voice
singing
Freut
euch
des
Lebens
I
glanced
into
the
arbour
it
was
Vera
Bravo
I
cried
I
didn
t
know
you
had
such
a
splendid
voice
She
was
rather
abashed
and
did
not
speak
Joking
apart
she
has
a
fine
strong
soprano
And
I
do
believe
she
has
never
even
suspected
that
she
has
a
good
voice
What
treasures
of
untouched
wealth
lie
hid
in
her
She
does
not
know
herself
But
am
I
not
right
in
saying
such
a
woman
is
a
rarity
in
our
time
August
12
We
had
a
very
strange
conversation
yesterday
We
touched
first
upon
apparitions
Fancy
she
believes
in
them
and
says
she
has
her
own
reasons
for
it
Priemkov
who
was
sitting
there
dropped
his
eyes
and
shook
his
head
as
though
in
confirmation
of
her
words
I
began
questioning
her
but
soon
noticed
that
this
conversation
was
disagreeable
to
her
We
began
talking
of
imagination
of
the
power
of
imagination
I
told
them
that
in
my
youth
I
used
to
dream
a
great
deal
about
happiness
the
common
occupation
of
people
who
have
not
had
or
are
not
having
good
luck
in
life
Among
other
dreams
I
used
to
brood
over
the
bliss
it
would
be
to
spend
a
few
weeks
with
the
woman
I
loved
in
Venice
I
so
often
mused
over
this
especially
at
night
that
gradually
there
grew
up
in
my
head
a
whole
picture
which
I
could
call
up
at
will
I
had
only
to
close
my
eyes
This
is
what
I
imagined
night
a
moon
the
moonlight
white
and
soft
a
scent
of
lemon
do
you
suppose
no
of
vanilla
a
scent
of
cactus
a
wide
expanse
of
water
a
flat
island
overgrown
with
olives
on
the
island
at
the
edge
of
the
shore
a
small
marble
house
with
open
windows
music
audible
coming
from
I
know
not
where
in
the
house
trees
with
dark
leaves
and
the
light
of
a
half-shaded
lamp
from
one
window
a
heavy
velvet
cloak
with
gold
fringe
hangs
out
with
one
end
falling
in
the
water
and
with
their
arms
on
the
cloak
sit
he
and
she
gazing
into
the
distance
where
Venice
can
be
seen
All
this
rose
as
clearly
before
my
mind
as
though
I
had
seen
it
all
with
my
own
eyes
She
listened
to
my
nonsense
and
said
that
she
too
often
dreamed
but
that
her
day-dreams
were
of
a
different
sort
she
fancied
herself
in
the
deserts
of
Africa
with
some
explorer
or
seeking
the
traces
of
Franklin
in
the
frozen
Arctic
Ocean
She
vividly
imagined
all
the
hardships
she
had
to
endure
all
the
difficulties
she
had
to
contend
with
You
have
read
a
lot
of
travels
observed
her
husband
Perhaps
she
responded
but
if
one
must
dream
why
need
one
dream
of
the
unattainable
And
why
not
I
retorted
Why
is
the
poor
unattainable
to
be
condemned
I
did
not
say
that
she
said
I
meant
to
say
what
need
is
there
to
dream
of
oneself
of
one
s
own
happiness
It
s
useless
thinking
of
that
it
does
not
come
why
pursue
it
It
is
like
health
when
you
don
t
think
of
it
it
means
that
it
s
there
These
words
astonished
me
There
s
a
great
soul
in
this
woman
believe
me
From
Venice
the
conversation
passed
to
Italy
to
the
Italians
Priemkov
went
away
Vera
and
I
were
left
alone
You
have
Italian
blood
in
your
veins
too
I
observed
Yes
she
responded
shall
I
show
you
the
portrait
of
my
grandmother
Please
do
She
went
to
her
own
sitting-room
and
brought
out
a
rather
large
gold
locket
Opening
this
locket
I
saw
excellently
painted
miniature
portraits
of
Madame
Eltsov
s
father
and
his
wife
the
peasant
woman
from
Albano
Vera
s
grandfather
struck
me
by
his
likeness
to
his
daughter
Only
his
features
set
in
a
white
cloud
of
powder
seemed
even
more
severe
sharp
and
hard
and
in
his
little
yellow
eyes
there
was
a
gleam
of
a
sort
of
sullen
obstinacy
But
what
a
face
the
Italian
woman
had
voluptuous
open
like
a
full-blown
rose
with
prominent
large
liquid
eyes
and
complacently
smiling
red
lips
Her
delicate
sensual
nostrils
seemed
dilating
and
quivering
as
after
recent
kisses
The
dark
cheeks
seemed
fragrant
of
glowing
heat
and
health
the
luxuriance
of
youth
and
womanly
power
That
brow
had
never
done
any
thinking
and
thank
God
she
had
been
depicted
in
her
Albanian
dress
The
artist
a
master
had
put
a
vine
in
her
hair
which
was
black
as
pitch
with
bright
grey
high
lights
this
Bacchic
ornament
was
in
marvellous
keeping
with
the
expression
of
her
face
And
do
you
know
of
whom
the
face
reminded
me
My
Manon
Lescaut
in
the
black
frame
And
what
is
most
wonderful
of
all
as
I
looked
at
the
portrait
I
recalled
that
in
Vera
too
in
spite
of
the
utter
dissimilarity
of
the
features
there
is
at
times
a
gleam
of
something
like
that
smile
that
look
Yes
I
tell
you
again
neither
she
herself
nor
any
one
else
in
the
world
knows
as
yet
all
that
is
latent
in
her
By
the
way
Madame
Eltsov
before
her
daughter
s
marriage
told
her
all
her
life
her
mother
s
death
and
so
on
probably
with
a
view
to
her
edification
What
specially
affected
Vera
was
what
she
heard
about
her
grandfather
the
mysterious
Ladanov
Isn
t
it
owing
to
that
that
she
believes
in
apparitions
It
s
strange
She
is
so
pure
and
bright
herself
and
yet
is
afraid
of
everything
dark
and
underground
and
believes
in
it
But
enough
Why
write
all
this
However
as
it
is
written
it
may
be
sent
off
to
you
Yours

SEVENTH
LETTER
From
the
SAME
to
the
SAME
M
VILLAGE
August
22
1850
I
take
up
my
pen
ten
days
after
my
last
letter
Oh
my
dear
fellow
I
can
t
hide
my
feelings
any
longer
How
wretched
I
am
How
I
love
her
You
can
imagine
with
what
a
thrill
of
bitterness
I
write
that
fatal
word
I
am
not
a
boy
not
a
young
man
even
I
am
no
longer
at
that
stage
when
to
deceive
another
is
almost
impossible
but
to
deceive
oneself
costs
no
effort
I
know
all
and
see
clearly
I
know
that
I
am
just
on
forty
that
she
s
another
man
s
wife
that
she
loves
her
husband
I
know
very
well
that
the
unhappy
feeling
which
has
gained
possession
of
me
can
lead
to
nothing
but
secret
torture
and
an
utter
waste
of
vital
energy
I
know
all
that
I
expect
nothing
and
I
wish
for
nothing
but
I
am
not
the
better
off
for
that
As
long
as
a
month
ago
I
began
to
notice
that
the
attraction
she
has
for
me
was
growing
stronger
and
stronger
This
partly
troubled
me
and
partly
even
delighted
me
But
how
could
I
dream
that
everything
would
be
repeated
with
me
which
you
would
have
thought
could
no
more
come
again
than
youth
can
What
am
I
saying
I
never
loved
like
this
no
never
Manon
Lescauts
Fritilions
these
were
my
idols
such
idols
can
easily
be
broken
but
now
only
now
I
have
found
out
what
it
is
to
love
a
woman
I
feel
ashamed
even
to
speak
of
it
but
it
s
so
I
m
ashamed
Love
is
egoism
any
way
and
at
my
years
it
s
not
permissible
to
be
an
egoist
at
thirty-seven
one
can
not
live
for
oneself
one
must
live
to
some
purpose
with
the
aim
of
doing
one
s
duty
one
s
work
on
earth
And
I
had
begun
to
set
to
work
And
here
everything
is
scattered
to
the
winds
again
as
by
a
hurricane
Now
I
understand
what
I
wrote
to
you
in
my
first
letter
I
understand
now
what
was
the
experience
I
had
missed
How
suddenly
this
blow
has
fallen
upon
me
I
stand
and
look
senselessly
forward
a
black
veil
hangs
before
my
eyes
my
heart
is
full
of
heaviness
and
dread
I
can
control
myself
I
am
outwardly
calm
not
only
before
others
but
even
in
solitude
I
can
t
really
rave
like
a
boy
But
the
worm
has
crept
into
my
heart
and
gnaws
it
night
and
day
How
will
it
end
Hitherto
I
have
fretted
and
suffered
when
away
from
her
and
in
her
presence
was
at
peace
again
at
once
now
I
have
no
rest
even
when
I
am
with
her
that
is
what
alarms
me
Oh
my
friend
how
hard
it
is
to
be
ashamed
of
one
s
tears
to
hide
them
Only
youth
may
weep
tears
are
only
fitting
for
the
young
I
can
not
read
over
this
letter
it
has
been
wrung
from
me
involuntarily
like
a
groan
I
can
add
nothing
tell
you
nothing
Give
me
time
I
will
come
to
myself
and
possess
my
soul
again
I
will
talk
to
you
like
a
man
but
now
I
am
longing
to
lay
my
head
on
your
breast
and
Oh
Mephistopheles
you
too
are
no
help
to
me
I
stopped
short
of
set
purpose
of
set
purpose
I
called
up
what
irony
is
in
me
I
told
myself
how
ludicrous
and
mawkish
these
laments
these
outbursts
will
seem
to
me
in
a
year
in
half
a
year
No
Mephistopheles
is
powerless
his
tooth
has
lost
its
edge
Farewell
Yours

EIGHTH
LETTER
From
the
SAME
to
the
SAME
M
VILLAGE
September
8
1850
My
dear
Semyon
Nikolaitch
You
have
taken
my
last
letter
too
much
to
heart
You
know
I
have
always
been
given
to
exaggerating
my
sensations
It
s
done
as
it
were
unconsciously
in
me
a
womanish
nature
In
the
process
of
years
this
will
pass
away
of
course
but
I
admit
with
a
sigh
I
have
not
corrected
the
failing
so
far
So
set
your
mind
at
rest
I
am
not
going
to
deny
the
impression
made
on
me
by
Vera
but
I
say
again
in
all
this
there
is
nothing
out
of
the
way
For
you
to
come
here
as
you
write
of
doing
would
be
out
of
the
question
quite
Post
over
a
thousand
versts
God
knows
with
what
object
why
it
would
be
madness
But
I
am
very
grateful
for
this
fresh
proof
of
your
affection
and
believe
me
I
shall
never
forget
it
Your
journey
here
would
be
the
more
out
of
place
as
I
mean
to
come
to
Petersburg
shortly
myself
When
I
am
sitting
on
your
sofa
I
shall
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
you
but
now
I
really
don
t
want
to
what
s
the
use
I
shall
only
talk
nonsense
I
dare
say
and
muddle
things
up
I
will
write
to
you
again
before
I
start
And
so
good-bye
for
a
little
while
Be
well
and
happy
and
don
t
worry
yourself
too
much
about
the
fate
of
your
devoted

NINTH
LETTER
From
the
SAME
to
the
SAME
P
VILLAGE
March
10
1853
I
have
been
a
long
while
without
answering
your
letter
I
have
been
all
these
days
thinking
about
it
I
felt
that
it
was
not
idle
curiosity
but
real
friendship
that
prompted
you
and
yet
I
hesitated
whether
to
follow
your
advice
whether
to
act
on
your
desire
I
have
made
up
my
mind
at
last
I
will
tell
you
everything
Whether
my
confession
will
ease
my
heart
as
you
suppose
I
don
t
know
but
it
seems
to
me
I
have
no
right
to
hide
from
you
what
has
changed
my
life
for
ever
it
seems
to
me
indeed
that
I
should
be
wronging
alas
even
more
wronging
the
dear
being
ever
in
my
thoughts
if
I
did
not
confide
our
mournful
secret
to
the
one
heart
still
dear
to
me
You
alone
perhaps
on
earth
remember
Vera
and
you
judge
of
her
lightly
and
falsely
that
I
can
not
endure
You
shall
know
all
Alas
it
can
all
be
told
in
a
couple
of
words
All
there
was
between
us
flashed
by
in
an
instant
like
lightning
and
like
lightning
brought
death
and
ruin
Over
two
years
have
passed
since
she
died
since
I
took
up
my
abode
in
this
remote
spot
which
I
shall
not
leave
till
the
end
of
my
days
and
everything
is
still
as
vivid
in
my
memory
my
wounds
are
still
as
fresh
my
grief
as
bitter
I
will
not
complain
Complaints
rouse
up
sorrow
and
so
ease
it
but
not
mine
I
will
begin
my
story
Do
you
remember
my
last
letter
the
letter
in
which
I
tried
to
allay
your
fears
and
dissuaded
you
from
coming
from
Petersburg
You
suspected
its
assumed
lightness
of
tone
you
put
no
faith
in
our
seeing
each
other
soon
you
were
right
On
the
day
before
I
wrote
to
you
I
had
learnt
that
I
was
loved
As
I
write
these
words
I
realise
how
hard
it
would
be
for
me
to
tell
my
story
to
the
end
The
ever
insistent
thought
of
her
death
will
torture
me
with
redoubled
force
I
shall
be
consumed
by
these
memories
But
I
will
try
to
master
myself
and
will
either
throw
aside
the
pen
or
will
say
not
a
word
more
than
is
necessary
This
is
how
I
learnt
that
Vera
loved
me
First
of
all
I
must
tell
you
and
you
will
believe
me
that
up
to
that
day
I
had
absolutely
no
suspicion
It
is
true
she
had
grown
pensive
at
times
which
had
never
been
the
way
with
her
before
but
I
did
not
know
why
this
change
had
come
upon
her
At
last
one
day
the
seventh
of
September
a
day
memorable
for
me
this
is
what
happened
You
know
how
I
loved
her
and
how
wretched
I
was
I
wandered
about
like
an
uneasy
spirit
and
could
find
no
rest
I
tried
to
keep
at
home
but
I
could
not
control
myself
and
went
off
to
her
I
found
her
alone
in
her
own
sitting-room
Priemkov
was
not
at
home
he
had
gone
out
shooting
When
I
went
in
to
Vera
she
looked
intently
at
me
and
did
not
respond
to
my
bow
She
was
sitting
at
the
window
on
her
knees
lay
a
book
I
recognised
at
once
it
was
my
Faust
Her
face
showed
traces
of
weariness
I
sat
down
opposite
her
She
asked
me
to
read
aloud
the
scene
of
Faust
with
Gretchen
when
she
asks
him
if
he
believes
in
God
I
took
the
book
and
began
reading
When
I
had
finished
I
glanced
at
her
Her
head
leaning
on
the
back
of
her
low
chair
and
her
arms
crossed
on
her
bosom
she
was
still
looking
as
intently
at
me
I
don
t
know
why
my
heart
suddenly
began
to
throb
What
have
you
done
to
me
she
said
in
a
slow
voice
What
I
articulated
in
confusion
Yes
what
have
you
done
to
me
she
repeated
You
mean
to
say
I
began
why
did
I
persuade
you
to
read
such
books
She
rose
without
speaking
and
went
out
of
the
room
I
looked
after
her
On
the
doorway
she
stopped
and
turned
to
me
I
love
you
she
said
that
s
what
you
have
done
to
me
The
blood
rushed
to
my
head
I
love
you
I
am
in
love
with
you
repeated
Vera
She
went
out
and
shut
the
door
after
her
I
will
not
try
to
describe
what
passed
within
me
then
I
remember
I
went
out
into
the
garden
made
my
way
into
a
thicket
leaned
against
a
tree
and
how
long
I
stood
there
I
could
not
say
I
felt
faint
and
numb
a
feeling
of
bliss
came
over
my
heart
with
a
rush
from
time
to
time
No
I
can
not
speak
of
that
Priemkov
s
voice
roused
me
from
my
stupor
they
had
sent
to
tell
him
I
had
come
he
had
come
home
from
shooting
and
was
looking
for
me
He
was
surprised
at
finding
me
alone
in
the
garden
without
a
hat
on
and
he
led
me
into
the
house
My
wife
s
in
the
drawing-room
he
observed
let
s
go
to
her
You
can
imagine
my
sensations
as
I
stepped
through
the
doorway
of
the
drawing-room
Vera
was
sitting
in
the
corner
at
her
embroidery
frame
I
stole
a
glance
at
her
and
it
was
a
long
while
before
I
raised
my
eyes
again
To
my
amazement
she
seemed
composed
there
was
no
trace
of
agitation
in
what
she
said
nor
in
the
sound
of
her
voice
At
last
I
brought
myself
to
look
at
her
Our
eyes
met
She
faintly
blushed
and
bent
over
her
canvas
I
began
to
watch
her
She
seemed
as
it
were
perplexed
a
cheerless
smile
hung
about
her
lips
now
and
then
Priemkov
went
out
She
suddenly
raised
her
head
and
in
a
rather
loud
voice
asked
me
What
do
you
intend
to
do
now
I
was
taken
aback
and
hurriedly
in
a
subdued
voice
answered
that
I
intended
to
do
the
duty
of
an
honest
man
to
go
away
for
I
added
I
love
you
Vera
Nikolaevna
you
have
probably
seen
that
long
ago
She
bent
over
her
canvas
again
and
seemed
to
ponder
I
must
talk
with
you
she
said
come
this
evening
after
tea
to
our
little
house
