hands
He
could
not
speak
he
was
choking
with
delight
She
looked
with
a
smile
into
his
eyes
there
was
such
rapture
in
them
she
felt
shy
Stay
she
said
fondly
taking
her
hand
away
from
him
let
me
take
off
my
hat
She
untied
the
strings
of
her
hat
flung
it
down
slipped
the
cape
off
her
shoulders
tidied
her
hair
and
sat
down
on
the
little
old
sofa
Insarov
gazed
at
her
without
stirring
like
one
enchanted
Sit
down
she
said
not
lifting
her
eyes
to
him
and
motioning
him
to
a
place
beside
her
Insarov
sat
down
not
on
the
sofa
but
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
Come
take
off
my
gloves
she
said
in
an
uncertain
voice
She
felt
afraid
He
began
first
to
unbutton
and
then
to
draw
off
one
glove
he
drew
it
half
off
and
greedily
pressed
his
lips
to
the
slender
soft
wrist
which
was
white
under
it
Elena
shuddered
and
would
have
pushed
him
back
with
the
other
hand
he
began
kissing
the
other
hand
too
Elena
drew
it
away
he
threw
back
his
head
she
looked
into
his
face
bent
above
him
and
their
lips
touched
An
instant
passed
she
broke
away
got
up
whispered
No
no
and
went
quickly
up
to
the
writing-table
I
am
mistress
here
you
know
so
you
ought
not
to
have
any
secrets
from
me
she
said
trying
to
seem
at
ease
and
standing
with
her
back
to
him
What
a
lot
of
papers
what
are
these
letters
Insarov
knitted
his
brows
Those
letters
he
said
getting
up
you
can
read
them
Elena
turned
them
over
in
her
hand
There
are
so
many
of
them
and
the
writing
is
so
fine
and
I
have
to
go
directly
let
them
be
They
re
not
from
a
rival
eh
and
they
re
not
in
Russian
she
added
turning
over
the
thin
sheets
Insarov
came
close
to
her
and
fondly
touched
her
waist
She
turned
suddenly
to
him
smiled
brightly
at
him
and
leant
against
his
shoulder
Those
letters
are
from
Bulgaria
Elena
my
friends
write
to
me
they
want
me
to
come
Now
To
them
Yes
now
while
there
is
still
time
while
it
is
still
possible
to
come
All
at
once
she
flung
both
arms
round
his
neck
You
will
take
me
with
you
yes
He
pressed
her
to
his
heart
O
my
sweet
girl
O
my
heroine
how
you
said
that
But
isn
t
it
wicked
isn
t
it
mad
for
me
a
homeless
solitary
man
to
drag
you
with
me
and
out
there
too
She
shut
his
mouth
Sh
or
I
shall
be
angry
and
never
come
to
see
you
again
Why
isn
t
it
all
decided
all
settled
between
us
Am
I
not
your
wife
Can
a
wife
be
parted
from
her
husband
Wives
don
t
go
into
war
he
said
with
a
half-mournful
smile
Oh
yes
when
they
can
t
stay
behind
and
I
can
not
stay
here
Elena
my
angel
but
think
I
have
perhaps
to
leave
Moscow
in
a
fortnight
I
can
t
think
of
university
lectures
or
finishing
my
work
What
interrupted
Elena
you
have
to
go
soon
If
you
like
I
will
stop
at
once
this
minute
with
you
for
ever
and
not
go
home
shall
I
Shall
we
go
at
once
Insarov
clasped
her
in
his
arms
with
redoubled
warmth
May
God
so
reward
me
then
he
cried
if
I
am
doing
wrong
From
to-day
we
are
one
for
ever
Am
I
to
stay
asked
Elena
No
my
pure
girl
no
my
treasure
You
shall
go
back
home
to-day
only
keep
yourself
in
readiness
This
is
a
matter
we
can
t
manage
straight
off
we
must
plan
it
out
well
We
want
money
a
passport
I
have
money
put
in
Elena
Eighty
roubles
Well
that
s
not
much
observed
Insarov
but
everything
s
a
help
But
I
can
get
more
I
will
borrow
I
will
ask
mamma
No
I
won
t
ask
mamma
for
any
But
I
can
sell
my
watch
I
have
earrings
too
and
two
bracelets
and
lace
Money
s
not
the
chief
difficulty
Elena
the
passport
your
passport
how
about
that
Yes
how
about
it
Is
a
passport
absolutely
necessary
Absolutely
Elena
laughed
What
a
queer
idea
I
remember
when
I
was
little
a
maid
of
ours
ran
away
She
was
caught
and
forgiven
and
lived
with
us
a
long
while
but
still
every
one
used
to
call
her
Tatyana
the
runaway
I
never
thought
then
that
I
too
might
perhaps
be
a
runaway
like
her
Elena
aren
t
you
ashamed
Why
Of
course
it
s
better
to
go
with
a
passport
But
if
we
can
t
We
will
settle
all
that
later
later
wait
a
little
said
Insarov
Let
me
look
about
let
me
think
a
little
We
will
talk
over
everything
together
thoroughly
I
too
have
money
Elena
pushed
back
the
hair
that
fell
over
on
his
forehead
O
Dmitri
how
glorious
it
will
be
for
us
two
to
set
off
together
Yes
said
Insarov
but
there
when
we
get
there
Well
put
in
Elena
and
won
t
it
be
glorious
to
die
together
too
but
no
why
should
we
die
We
will
live
we
are
young
How
old
are
you
Twenty-six
Yes
twenty-six
And
I
am
twenty
There
is
plenty
of
time
before
us
Ah
you
tried
to
run
away
from
me
You
did
not
want
a
Russian
s
love
you
Bulgarian
Let
me
see
you
trying
to
escape
from
me
now
What
would
have
become
of
us
if
I
hadn
t
come
to
you
then
Elena
you
know
what
forced
me
to
go
away
I
know
you
were
in
love
and
you
were
afraid
But
surely
you
must
have
suspected
that
you
were
loved
I
swear
on
my
honour
Elena
I
didn
t
She
gave
him
a
quick
unexpected
kiss
There
I
love
you
for
that
too
And
goodbye
You
can
t
stop
longer
asked
Insarov
No
dearest
Do
you
think
it
s
easy
for
me
to
get
out
alone
The
quarter
of
an
hour
was
over
long
ago
She
put
on
her
cape
and
hat
And
you
come
to
us
to-morrow
evening
No
the
day
after
to-morrow
We
shall
be
constrained
and
dreary
but
we
can
t
help
that
at
least
we
shall
see
each
other
Good-bye
Let
me
go
He
embraced
her
for
the
last
time
Ah
take
care
you
have
broken
my
watch-chain
Oh
what
a
clumsy
boy
There
never
mind
It
s
all
the
better
I
will
go
to
Kuznetsky
bridge
and
leave
it
to
be
mended
If
I
am
asked
I
can
say
I
have
been
to
Kuznetsky
bridge
She
held
the
door-handle
By-the-way
I
forgot
to
tell
you
Monsieur
Kurnatovsky
will
certainly
make
me
an
offer
in
a
day
or
two
But
the
answer
I
shall
make
him
will
be
this
She
put
the
thumb
of
her
left
hand
to
the
tip
of
her
nose
and
flourished
the
other
fingers
in
the
air
Good-bye
till
we
see
each
other
again
Now
I
know
the
way
And
don
t
lose
any
time
Elena
opened
the
door
a
little
listened
turned
round
to
Insarov
nodded
her
head
and
glided
out
of
the
room
For
a
minute
Insarov
stood
before
the
closed
door
and
he
too
listened
The
door
downstairs
into
the
court
slammed
He
went
up
to
the
sofa
sat
down
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
Never
before
had
anything
like
this
happened
to
him
What
have
I
done
to
deserve
such
love
he
thought
Is
it
a
dream
But
the
delicate
scent
of
mignonette
left
by
Elena
in
his
poor
dark
little
room
told
of
her
visit
And
with
it
it
seemed
that
the
air
was
still
full
of
the
notes
of
a
young
voice
and
the
sound
of
a
light
young
tread
and
the
warmth
and
freshness
of
a
young
girlish
body
Insarov
decided
to
await
more
positive
news
and
began
to
make
preparations
for
departure
The
difficulty
was
a
serious
one
For
him
personally
there
were
no
obstacles
He
had
only
to
ask
for
a
passport
but
how
would
it
be
with
Elena
To
get
her
a
passport
in
the
legal
way
was
impossible
Should
he
marry
her
secretly
and
should
they
then
go
and
present
themselves
to
the
parents
They
would
let
us
go
then
he
thought
But
if
they
did
not
We
would
go
all
the
same
But
suppose
they
were
to
make
a
complaint
if
No
better
try
to
get
a
passport
somehow
He
decided
to
consult
of
course
mentioning
no
names
one
of
his
acquaintances
an
attorney
retired
from
practice
or
perhaps
struck
off
the
rolls
an
old
and
experienced
hand
at
all
sorts
of
clandestine
business
This
worthy
person
did
not
live
near
Insarov
was
a
whole
hour
in
getting
to
him
in
a
very
sorry
droshky
and
to
make
matters
worse
he
did
not
find
him
at
home
and
on
his
way
back
got
soaked
to
the
skin
by
a
sudden
downpour
of
rain
The
next
morning
in
spite
of
a
rather
severe
headache
Insarov
set
off
a
second
time
to
call
on
the
retired
attorney
The
retired
attorney
listened
to
him
attentively
taking
snuff
from
a
snuff-box
decorated
with
a
picture
of
a
full-bosomed
nymph
and
glancing
stealthily
at
his
visitor
with
his
sly
and
also
snuff-coloured
little
eyes
he
heard
him
to
the
end
and
then
demanded
greater
definiteness
in
the
statement
of
the
facts
of
the
case
and
observing
that
Insarov
was
unwilling
to
launch
into
particulars
it
was
against
the
grain
that
he
had
come
to
him
at
all
he
confined
himself
to
the
advice
to
provide
himself
above
all
things
with
the
needful
and
asked
him
to
come
to
him
again
when
you
have
he
added
sniffing
at
the
snuff
in
the
open
snuff-box
augmented
your
confidence
and
decreased
your
diffidence
he
talked
with
a
broad
accent
A
passport
he
added
as
though
to
himself
is
a
thing
that
can
be
arranged
you
go
a
journey
for
instance
who
s
to
tell
whether
you
re
Marya
Bredihin
or
Karolina
Vogel-meier
A
feeling
of
nausea
came
over
Insarov
but
he
thanked
the
attorney
and
promised
to
come
to
him
again
in
a
day
or
two
The
same
evening
he
went
to
the
Stahovs
Anna
Vassilyevna
met
him
cordially
reproached
him
a
little
for
having
quite
forgotten
them
and
finding
him
pale
inquired
especially
after
his
health
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
did
not
say
a
single
word
to
him
he
only
stared
at
him
with
elaborately
careless
curiosity
Shubin
treated
him
coldly
but
Elena
astounded
him
She
was
expecting
him
she
had
put
on
for
him
the
very
dress
she
wore
on
the
day
of
their
first
interview
in
the
chapel
but
she
welcomed
him
so
calmly
and
was
so
polite
and
carelessly
gay
that
no
one
looking
at
her
could
have
believed
that
this
girl
s
fate
was
already
decided
and
that
it
was
only
the
secret
consciousness
of
happy
love
that
gave
fire
to
her
features
lightness
and
charm
to
all
her
gestures
She
poured
out
tea
in
Zoya
s
place
jested
chattered
she
knew
Shubin
would
be
watching
her
that
Insarov
was
incapable
of
wearing
a
mask
and
incapable
of
appearing
indifferent
and
she
had
prepared
herself
beforehand
She
was
not
mistaken
Shubin
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
and
Insarov
was
very
silent
and
gloomy
the
whole
evening
Elena
was
so
happy
that
she
even
felt
an
inclination
to
tease
him
Oh
by
the
way
she
said
to
him
suddenly
is
your
plan
getting
on
at
all
Insarov
was
taken
aback
What
plan
he
said
Why
have
you
forgotten
she
rejoined
laughing
in
his
face
he
alone
could
tell
the
meaning
of
that
happy
laugh
Your
Bulgarian
selections
for
Russian
readers
Quelle
bourde
muttered
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
between
his
teeth
Zoya
sat
down
to
the
piano
Elena
gave
a
just
perceptible
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
with
her
eyes
motioned
Insarov
to
the
door
Then
she
twice
slowly
touched
the
table
with
her
finger
and
looked
at
him
He
understood
that
she
was
promising
to
see
him
in
two
days
and
she
gave
him
a
quick
smile
when
she
saw
he
understood
her
Insarov
got
up
and
began
to
take
leave
he
felt
unwell
Kurnatovsky
arrived
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
jumped
up
raised
his
right
hand
higher
than
his
head
and
softly
dropped
it
into
the
palm
of
the
chief
secretary
Insarov
would
have
remained
a
few
minutes
longer
to
have
a
look
at
his
rival
Elena
shook
her
head
unseen
the
host
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
introduce
them
to
one
another
and
Insarov
departed
exchanging
one
last
look
with
Elena
Shubin
pondered
and
pondered
and
threw
himself
into
a
fierce
argument
with
Kurnatovsky
on
a
legislative
question
about
which
he
had
not
a
single
idea
Insarov
did
not
sleep
all
night
and
in
the
morning
he
felt
very
ill
he
set
to
work
however
putting
his
papers
into
order
and
writing
letters
but
his
head
was
heavy
and
confused
At
dinner
time
he
began
to
be
in
a
fever
he
could
eat
nothing
The
fever
grew
rapidly
worse
towards
evening
he
had
aching
pains
in
all
his
limbs
and
a
terrible
headache
Insarov
lay
down
on
the
very
little
sofa
on
which
Elena
had
lately
sat
he
thought
It
serves
me
right
for
going
to
that
old
rascal
and
he
tried
to
sleep
But
the
illness
had
by
now
complete
mastery
of
him
His
veins
were
throbbing
violently
his
blood
was
on
fire
his
thoughts
were
flying
round
like
birds
He
sank
into
forgetfulness
He
lay
like
a
man
felled
by
a
blow
on
his
face
and
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
some
one
was
softly
laughing
and
whispering
over
him
he
opened
his
eyes
with
an
effort
the
light
of
the
flaring
candle
smote
him
like
a
knife
What
was
it
the
old
attorney
was
before
him
in
an
Oriental
silk
gown
belted
with
a
silk
handkerchief
as
he
had
seen
him
the
evening
before
Karolina
Vogelmeier
muttered
his
toothless
mouth
Insarov
stared
and
the
old
man
grew
wide
and
thick
and
tall
he
was
no
longer
a
man
he
was
a
tree
Insarov
had
to
climb
along
its
gnarled
branches
He
clung
and
fell
with
his
breast
on
a
sharp
stone
and
Karolina
Vogelmeier
was
sitting
on
her
heels
looking
like
a
pedlar-woman
and
lisping
Pies
pies
pies
for
sale
and
there
were
streams
of
blood
and
swords
flashing
incessantly
Elena
And
everything
vanished
is
a
crimson
chaos
There
s
some
one
here
looks
like
a
locksmith
or
something
of
the
sort
Bersenyev
was
informed
the
following
evening
by
his
servant
who
was
distinguished
by
a
severe
deportment
and
sceptical
turn
of
mind
towards
his
master
he
wants
to
see
you
Ask
him
in
said
Bersenyev
The
locksmith
entered
Bersenyev
recognised
in
him
the
tailor
the
landlord
of
Insarov
s
lodgings
What
do
you
want
he
asked
him
I
came
to
your
honour
began
the
tailor
shifting
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
at
times
waving
his
right
hand
with
his
cuff
clutched
in
his
three
last
fingers
Our
lodger
seemingly
is
very
ill
Insarov
Yes
our
lodger
to
be
sure
yesterday
morning
he
was
still
on
his
legs
in
the
evening
he
asked
for
nothing
but
drink
the
missis
took
him
some
water
and
at
night
he
began
talking
away
we
could
hear
him
through
the
partition-wall
and
this
morning
he
lies
without
a
word
like
a
log
and
the
fever
he
s
in
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
I
thought
upon
my
word
he
ll
die
for
sure
I
ought
to
send
word
to
the
police
station
I
thought
For
he
s
so
alone
but
the
missis
said
Go
to
that
gentleman
she
says
at
whose
country
place
our
lodger
stayed
maybe
he
ll
tell
you
what
to
do
or
come
himself
So
I
ve
come
to
your
honour
for
we
can
t
so
to
say
Bersenyev
snatched
up
his
cap
thrust
a
rouble
into
the
tailor
s
hand
and
at
once
set
off
with
him
post
haste
to
Insarov
s
lodgings
He
found
him
lying
on
the
sofa
unconscious
and
not
undressed
His
face
was
terribly
changed
Bersenyev
at
once
ordered
the
people
of
the
house
to
undress
him
and
put
him
to
bed
while
he
rushed
off
himself
and
returned
with
a
doctor
The
doctor
prescribed
leeches
mustard-poultices
and
calomel
and
ordered
him
to
be
bled
Is
he
dangerously
ill
asked
Bersenyev
Yes
very
dangerously
answered
the
doctor
Severe
inflammation
of
the
lungs
peripneumonia
fully
developed
and
the
brain
perhaps
affected
but
the
patient
is
young
His
very
strength
is
something
against
him
now
I
was
sent
for
too
late
still
we
will
do
all
that
science
dictates
The
doctor
was
young
himself
and
still
believed
in
science
Bersenyev
stayed
the
night
The
people
of
the
house
seemed
kind
and
even
prompt
directly
there
was
some
one
to
tell
them
what
was
to
be
done
An
assistant
arrived
and
began
to
carry
out
the
medical
measures
Towards
morning
Insarov
revived
for
a
few
minutes
recognised
Bersenyev
asked
Am
I
ill
then
looked
about
him
with
the
vague
listless
bewilderment
of
a
man
dangerously
ill
and
again
relapsed
into
unconsciousness
Bersenyev
went
home
changed
his
clothes
and
taking
a
few
books
along
with
him
he
returned
to
Insarov
s
lodgings
He
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
there
at
least
for
a
time
He
shut
in
Insarov
s
bed
with
screens
and
arranged
a
little
place
for
himself
by
the
sofa
The
day
passed
slowly
and
drearily
Bersenyev
did
not
leave
the
room
except
to
get
his
dinner
The
evening
came
He
lighted
a
candle
with
a
shade
and
settled
down
to
a
book
Everything
was
still
around
Through
the
partition
wall
could
be
heard
suppressed
whispering
in
the
landlord
s
room
then
a
yawn
and
a
sigh
Some
one
sneezed
and
was
scolded
in
a
whisper
behind
the
screen
was
heard
the
patient
s
heavy
uneven
breathing
sometimes
broken
by
a
short
groan
and
the
uneasy
tossing
of
his
head
on
the
pillow
Strange
fancies
came
over
Bersenyev
He
found
himself
in
the
room
of
a
man
whose
life
was
hanging
on
a
thread
the
man
whom
as
he
knew
Elena
loved
He
remembered
that
night
when
Shubin
had
overtaken
him
and
declared
that
she
loved
him
him
Bersenyev
And
now
What
am
I
to
do
now
he
asked
himself
Let
Elena
know
of
his
illness
Wait
a
little
This
would
be
worse
news
for
her
than
what
I
told
her
once
before
strange
how
fate
makes
me
the
go-between
between
them
He
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
better
to
wait
a
little
His
eyes
fell
on
the
table
covered
with
heaps
of
papers
Will
he
carry
out
his
dreams
thought
Bersenyev
Can
it
be
that
all
will
come
to
nothing
And
he
was
filled
with
pity
for
the
young
life
struck
down
and
he
vowed
to
himself
to
save
it
The
night
was
an
uneasy
one
The
sick
man
was
very
delirious
Several
times
Bersenyev
got
up
from
his
little
sofa
approached
the
bed
on
tip-toe
and
listened
with
a
heavy
heart
to
his
disconnected
muttering
Only
once
Insarov
spoke
with
sudden
distinctness
I
won
t
I
won
t
she
mustn
t
Bersenyev
started
and
looked
at
Insarov
his
face
suffering
and
death-like
at
the
same
time
was
immovable
and
his
hands
lay
powerless
I
won
t
he
repeated
scarcely
audibly
The
doctor
came
in
the
morning
shook
his
head
and
wrote
fresh
prescriptions
The
crisis
is
a
long
way
off
still
he
said
putting
on
his
hat
And
after
the
crisis
asked
Bersenyev
The
crisis
may
end
in
two
ways
aut
Caesar
aut
nihil
The
doctor
went
away
Bersenyev
walked
a
few
times
up
and
down
the
street
he
felt
in
need
of
fresh
air
He
went
back
and
took
up
a
book
again
Raumer
he
had
finished
long
ago
he
was
now
making
a
study
of
Grote
Suddenly
the
door
softly
creaked
and
the
head
of
the
landlord
s
daughter
covered
as
usual
with
a
heavy
kerchief
was
cautiously
thrust
into
the
room
Here
is
the
lady
she
whispered
who
gave
me
a
silver
piece
The
child
s
head
vanished
quickly
and
in
its
place
appeared
Elena
Bersenyev
jumped
up
as
if
he
had
been
stung
but
Elena
did
not
stir
nor
cry
out
It
seemed
as
if
she
understood
everything
in
a
single
instant
A
terrible
pallor
overspread
her
face
she
went
up
to
the
screen
looked
behind
it
threw
up
her
arms
and
seemed
turned
to
stone
A
moment
more
and
she
would
have
flung
herself
on
Insarov
but
Bersenyev
stopped
her
What
are
you
doing
he
said
in
a
trembling
whisper
you
might
be
the
death
of
him
She
was
reeling
He
led
her
to
the
sofa
and
made
her
sit
down
She
looked
into
his
face
then
her
eyes
ran
over
him
from
head
to
foot
then
stared
at
the
floor
Will
he
die
she
asked
so
coldly
and
quietly
that
Bersenyev
was
frightened
For
God
s
sake
Elena
Nikolaevna
he
began
what
are
you
saying
He
is
ill
certainly
and
rather
seriously
but
we
will
save
him
I
promise
you
that
He
is
unconscious
she
asked
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
as
before
Yes
he
is
unconscious
at
present
That
s
always
the
case
at
the
early
stage
of
these
illnesses
but
it
means
nothing
nothing
I
assure
you
Drink
some
water
She
raised
her
eyes
to
his
and
he
saw
she
had
not
heard
his
answer
If
he
dies
she
said
in
the
same
voice
I
will
die
too
At
that
instant
Insarov
uttered
a
slight
moan
she
trembled
all
over
clutched
at
her
head
then
began
untying
the
strings
of
her
hat
What
are
you
doing
Bersenyev
asked
her
I
will
stay
here
You
will
stay
for
long
I
don
t
know
perhaps
all
day
the
night
always
I
don
t
know
For
God
s
sake
Elena
Nikolaevna
control
yourself
I
could
not
of
course
have
any
expectation
of
seeing
you
here
but
still
I
assume
you
have
come
for
a
short
time
Remember
they
may
miss
you
at
home
What
then
They
will
look
for
you
find
you
What
then
Elena
Nikolaevna
You
see
He
can
not
now
protect
you
She
dropped
her
head
seemed
lost
in
thought
raised
a
handkerchief
to
her
lips
and
convulsive
sobs
tearing
her
by
their
violence
were
suddenly
wrung
from
her
breast
She
threw
herself
face
downwards
on
the
sofa
trying
to
stifle
them
but
still
her
body
heaved
and
throbbed
like
a
captured
bird
Elena
Nikolaevna
for
God
s
sake
Bersenyev
was
repeating
over
her
Ah
What
is
it
suddenly
sounded
the
voice
of
Insarov
Elena
started
up
and
Bersenyev
felt
rooted
to
the
spot
After
waiting
a
little
he
went
up
to
the
bed
Insarov
s
head
lay
on
the
pillow
helpless
as
before
his
eyes
were
closed
Is
he
delirious
whispered
Elena
It
seems
so
answered
Bersenyev
but
that
s
nothing
it
s
always
so
especially
if
When
was
he
taken
ill
Elena
broke
in
The
day
before
yesterday
I
have
been
here
since
yesterday
Rely
on
me
Elena
Nikolaevna
I
will
not
leave
him
everything
shall
be
done
If
necessary
we
will
have
a
consultation
He
will
die
without
me
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
I
give
you
my
word
I
will
let
you
hear
every
day
how
his
illness
goes
on
and
if
there
should
be
immediate
danger
Swear
you
will
send
for
me
at
once
whenever
it
may
be
day
or
night
write
a
note
straight
to
me
I
care
for
nothing
now
Do
you
hear
you
promise
you
will
do
that
I
promise
before
God
Swear
it
I
swear
She
suddenly
snatched
his
hand
and
before
he
had
time
to
pull
it
away
she
had
bent
and
pressed
her
lips
to
it
Elena
Nikolaevna
what
are
you
he
stammered
No
no
I
won
t
have
it
Insarov
muttered
indistinctly
and
sighed
painfully
Elena
went
up
to
the
screen
her
handkerchief
pressed
between
her
teeth
and
bent
a
long
long
look
on
the
sick
man
Silent
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
Elena
Nikolaevna
Bersenyev
said
to
her
he
might
come
to
himself
and
recognise
you
there
s
no
knowing
if
that
wouldn
t
do
harm
Besides
from
hour
to
hour
I
expect
the
doctor
Elena
took
her
hat
from
the
sofa
put
it
on
and
stood
still
Her
eyes
strayed
mournfully
over
the
room
She
seemed
to
be
remembering
I
can
not
go
away
she
whispered
at
last
Bersenyev
pressed
her
hand
Try
to
pull
yourself
together
he
said
calm
yourself
you
are
leaving
him
in
my
care
I
will
come
to
you
this
very
evening
Elena
looked
at
him
said
Oh
my
good
kind
friend
broke
into
sobs
and
rushed
away
Bersenyev
leaned
against
the
door
A
feeling
of
sorrow
and
bitterness
not
without
a
kind
of
strange
consolation
overcame
him
My
good
kind
friend
he
thought
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
Who
is
here
he
heard
Insarov
s
voice
Bersenyev
went
up
to
him
I
am
here
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
How
are
you
How
do
you
feel
Are
you
alone
asked
the
sick
man
Yes
And
she
Whom
do
you
mean
Bersenyev
asked
almost
in
dismay
Insarov
was
silent
Mignonette
he
murmured
and
his
eyes
closed
again
For
eight
whole
days
Insarov
lay
between
life
and
death
The
doctor
was
incessantly
visiting
him
interested
as
a
young
man
in
a
difficult
case
Shubin
heard
of
Insarov
s
critical
position
and
made
inquiries
after
him
His
compatriots
Bulgarians
came
among
them
Bersenyev
recognised
the
two
strange
figures
who
had
puzzled
him
by
their
unexpected
visit
to
the
cottage
they
all
showed
genuine
sympathy
some
offered
to
take
Bersenyev
s
place
by
the
patient
s
bed-side
but
he
would
not
consent
to
that
remembering
his
promise
to
Elena
He
saw
her
every
day
and
secretly
reported
to
her
sometimes
by
word
of
mouth
sometimes
in
a
brief
note
every
detail
of
the
illness
With
what
sinkings
of
the
heart
she
awaited
him
how
she
listened
and
questioned
him
She
was
always
on
the
point
of
hastening
to
Insarov
herself
but
Bersenyev
begged
her
not
to
do
this
Insarov
was
seldom
alone
On
the
first
day
she
knew
of
his
illness
she
herself
had
almost
fallen
ill
directly
she
got
home
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
but
she
was
summoned
to
dinner
and
appeared
in
the
dining-room
with
such
a
face
that
Anna
Vassilyevna
was
alarmed
and
was
anxious
to
put
her
to
bed
Elena
succeeded
however
in
controlling
herself
If
he
dies
she
repeated
it
will
be
the
end
of
me
too
This
thought
tranquillised
her
and
enabled
her
to
seem
indifferent
Besides
no
one
troubled
her
much
Anna
Vassilyevna
was
taken
up
with
her
swollen
face
Shubin
was
working
furiously
Zoya
was
given
up
to
pensiveness
and
disposed
to
read
Werther
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
was
much
displeased
at
the
frequent
visits
of
the
scholar
especially
as
his
cherished
projects
in
regard
to
Kurnatovsky
were
making
no
way
the
practical
chief
secretary
was
puzzled
and
biding
his
time
Elena
did
not
even
thank
Bersenyev
there
are
services
for
which
thanks
are
cruel
and
shameful
Only
once
at
her
fourth
interview
with
him
Insarov
had
passed
a
very
bad
night
the
doctor
had
hinted
at
a
consultation
only
then
she
reminded
him
of
his
promise
Very
well
then
let
us
go
he
said
to
her
She
got
up
and
was
going
to
get
ready
No
he
decided
let
us
wait
till
to-morrow
Towards
evening
Insarov
was
rather
better
For
eight
days
this
torture
was
prolonged
Elena
appeared
calm
but
she
could
eat
nothing
and
did
not
sleep
at
night
There
was
a
dull
ache
in
all
her
limbs
her
head
seemed
full
of
a
sort
of
dry
burning
smoke
Our
young
lady
s
wasting
like
a
candle
her
maid
said
of
her
At
last
by
the
ninth
day
the
crisis
was
passing
over
Elena
was
sitting
in
the
drawing-room
near
Anna
Vassilyevna
and
without
knowing
herself
what
she
was
doing
was
reading
her
the
Moscow
Gazette
Bersenyev
came
in
Elena
glanced
at
him
how
rapid
and
fearful
and
penetrating
and
tremulous
was
the
first
glance
she
turned
on
him
every
time
and
at
once
she
guessed
that
he
brought
good
news
He
was
smiling
he
nodded
slightly
to
her
she
got
up
to
go
and
meet
him
He
has
regained
consciousness
he
is
saved
he
will
be
quite
well
again
in
a
week
he
whispered
to
her
Elena
had
stretched
out
her
arm
as
though
to
ward
off
a
blow
and
she
said
nothing
only
her
lips
trembled
and
a
flush
of
crimson
overspread
her
whole
face
Bersenyev
began
to
talk
to
Anna
Vassilyevna
and
Elena
went
off
to
her
own
room
dropped
on
her
knees
and
fell
to
praying
to
thanking
God
Light
shining
tears
trickled
down
her
cheeks
Suddenly
she
was
conscious
of
intense
weariness
laid
her
head
down
on
the
pillow
whispered
poor
Andrei
Petrovitch
and
at
once
fell
asleep
with
wet
eheeks
and
eyelashes
It
was
long
since
she
had
slept
or
wept
Bersenyev
s
words
turned
out
only
partly
true
the
danger
was
over
but
Insarov
gained
strength
slowly
and
the
doctor
talked
of
a
complete
undermining
of
the
whole
system
The
patient
left
his
bed
for
all
that
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
Bersenyev
went
home
to
his
own
lodging
but
he
came
every
day
to
his
still
feeble
friend
and
every
day
as
before
he
informed
Elena
of
the
state
of
his
health
Insarov
did
not
dare
to
write
to
her
and
only
indirectly
in
his
conversations
with
Bersenyev
referred
to
her
but
Bersenyev
with
assumed
carelessness
told
him
about
his
visits
to
the
Stahovs
trying
however
to
give
