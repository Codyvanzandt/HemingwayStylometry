Derzhavin
but
liked
Marlinsky
and
called
Ammalat-Bek
the
best
of
the
pack
A
few
days
after
my
first
meeting
with
the
two
friends
I
set
off
for
the
village
of
Bezsonovo
to
see
Panteley
Eremyitch
His
little
house
could
be
seen
a
long
way
off
it
stood
out
on
a
bare
place
half
a
mile
from
the
village
on
the
'bluff
as
it
is
called
like
a
hawk
on
a
ploughed
field
Tchertop-hanov
's
homestead
consisted
of
nothing
more
than
four
old
tumble-down
buildings
of
different
sizes
that
is
a
lodge
a
stable
a
barn
and
a
bath-house
Each
building
stood
apart
by
itself
there
was
neither
a
fence
round
nor
a
gate
to
be
seen
My
coachman
stopped
in
perplexity
at
a
well
which
was
choked
up
and
had
almost
disappeared
Near
the
barn
some
thin
and
unkempt
puppies
were
mangling
a
dead
horse
probably
Orbassan
one
of
them
lifted
up
the
bleeding
nose
barked
hurriedly
and
again
fell
to
devouring
the
bare
ribs
Near
the
horse
stood
a
boy
of
seventeen
with
a
puffy
yellow
face
dressed
like
a
Cossack
and
barelegged
he
looked
with
a
responsible
air
at
the
dogs
committed
to
his
charge
and
now
and
then
gave
the
greediest
a
lash
with
his
whip
'Is
your
master
at
home
I
inquired
'The
Lord
knows
answered
the
lad
'you
'd
better
knock
I
jumped
out
of
the
droshky
and
went
up
to
the
steps
of
the
lodge
Mr
Tchertop-hanov
's
dwelling
presented
a
very
cheerless
aspect
the
beams
were
blackened
and
bulging
forward
the
chimney
had
fallen
off
the
corners
of
the
house
were
stained
with
damp
and
sunk
out
of
the
perpendicular
the
small
dusty
bluish
windows
peeped
out
from
under
the
shaggy
overhanging
roof
with
an
indescribably
morose
expression
some
old
vagrants
have
eyes
that
look
like
that
I
knocked
no
one
responded
I
could
hear
however
through
the
door
some
sharply
uttered
words
'A
B
C
there
now
idiot
a
hoarse
voice
was
saying
'A
B
C
D
no
D
E
E
E
Now
then
idiot
I
knocked
a
second
time
The
same
voice
shouted
'Come
in
who
's
there
I
went
into
the
small
empty
hall
and
through
the
open
door
I
saw
Tchertop-hanov
himself
In
a
greasy
oriental
dressing-gown
loose
trousers
and
a
red
skull-cap
he
was
sitting
on
a
chair
in
one
hand
he
gripped
the
face
of
a
young
poodle
while
in
the
other
he
was
holding
a
piece
of
bread
just
above
his
nose
'Ah
he
pronounced
with
dignity
not
stirring
from
his
seat
'delighted
to
see
you
Please
sit
down
I
am
busy
here
with
Venzor
Tihon
Ivanitch
he
added
raising
his
voice
'come
here
will
you
Here
's
a
visitor
'I
'm
coming
I
'm
coming
Tihon
Ivanitch
responded
from
the
other
room
'Masha
give
me
my
cravat
Tchertop-hanov
turned
to
Venzor
again
and
laid
the
piece
of
bread
on
his
nose
I
looked
round
Except
an
extending
table
much
warped
with
thirteen
legs
of
unequal
length
and
four
rush
chairs
worn
into
hollows
there
was
no
furniture
of
any
kind
in
the
room
the
walls
which
had
been
washed
white
ages
ago
with
blue
star-shaped
spots
were
peeling
off
in
many
places
between
the
windows
hung
a
broken
tarnished
looking-glass
in
a
huge
frame
of
red
wood
In
the
corners
stood
pipestands
and
guns
from
the
ceiling
hung
fat
black
cobwebs
'A
B
C
D
Tchertop-hanov
repeated
slowly
and
suddenly
he
cried
furiously
'_E
E
E
E
What
a
stupid
brute
But
the
luckless
poodle
only
shivered
and
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
open
his
mouth
he
still
sat
wagging
his
tail
uneasily
and
wrinkling
up
his
face
blinked
dejectedly
and
frowned
as
though
saying
to
himself
'Of
course
it
's
just
as
you
please
'There
eat
come
take
it
repeated
the
indefatigable
master
'You
've
frightened
him
I
remarked
'Well
he
can
get
along
then
He
gave
him
a
kick
The
poor
dog
got
up
softly
dropped
the
bread
off
his
nose
and
walked
as
it
were
on
tiptoe
to
the
hall
deeply
wounded
And
with
good
reason
a
stranger
calling
for
the
first
time
and
to
treat
him
like
that
The
door
from
the
next
room
gave
a
subdued
creak
and
Mr
Nedopyuskin
came
in
affably
bowing
and
smiling
I
got
up
and
bowed
'Do
n't
disturb
yourself
do
n't
disturb
yourself
he
lisped
We
sat
down
Tchertop-hanov
went
into
the
next
room
'You
have
been
for
some
time
in
our
neighbourhood
began
Nedopyuskin
in
a
subdued
voice
coughing
discreetly
into
his
hand
and
holding
his
fingers
before
his
lips
from
a
feeling
of
propriety
'I
came
last
month
'Indeed
We
were
silent
for
a
little
'Lovely
weather
we
are
having
just
now
resumed
Nedopyuskin
and
he
looked
gratefully
at
me
as
though
I
were
in
some
way
responsible
for
the
weather
'the
corn
one
may
say
is
doing
wonderfully
I
nodded
in
token
of
assent
We
were
silent
again
'Panteley
Eremyitch
was
pleased
to
hunt
two
hares
yesterday
Nedopyuskin
began
again
with
an
effort
obviously
wishing
to
enliven
the
conversation
'yes
indeed
very
big
hares
they
were
sir
'Has
Mr
Tchertop-hanov
good
hounds
'The
most
wonderful
hounds
sir
Nedopyuskin
replied
delighted
'one
may
say
the
best
in
the
province
indeed
He
drew
nearer
to
me
'But
then
Panteley
Eremyitch
is
such
a
wonderful
man
He
has
only
to
wish
for
anything
he
has
only
to
take
an
idea
into
his
head
and
before
you
can
look
round
it
's
done
everything
you
may
say
goes
like
clockwork
Panteley
Eremyitch
I
assure
you
Tchertop-hanov
came
into
the
room
Nedopyuskin
smiled
ceased
speaking
and
indicated
him
to
me
with
a
glance
which
seemed
to
say
'There
you
will
see
for
yourself
We
fell
to
talking
about
hunting
'Would
you
like
me
to
show
you
my
leash
Tchertop-hanov
asked
me
and
not
waiting
for
a
reply
he
called
Karp
A
sturdy
lad
came
in
in
a
green
nankin
long
coat
with
a
blue
collar
and
livery
buttons
'Tell
Fomka
said
Tchertop-hanov
abruptly
'to
bring
in
Ammalat
and
Saiga
and
in
good
order
do
you
understand
Karp
gave
a
broad
grin
uttered
an
indefinite
sound
and
went
away
Fomka
made
his
appearance
well
combed
and
tightly
buttoned
up
in
boots
and
with
the
hounds
From
politeness
I
admired
the
stupid
beasts
harriers
are
all
exceedingly
stupid
Tchertop-hanov
spat
right
into
Ammalat
's
nostrils
which
did
not
however
apparently
afford
that
dog
the
slightest
satisfaction
Nedopyuskin
too
stroked
Ammalat
from
behind
We
began
chatting
again
By
degrees
Tchertop-hanov
unbent
completely
and
no
longer
stood
on
his
dignity
nor
snorted
defiantly
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
He
glanced
at
me
and
at
Nedopyuskin
'Hey
he
cried
suddenly
'why
should
she
sit
in
there
alone
Masha
hi
Masha
come
in
here
Some
one
stirred
in
the
next
room
but
there
was
no
answer
'Ma-a-sha
Tchertop-hanov
repeated
caressingly
'come
in
here
It
's
all
right
do
n't
be
afraid
The
door
was
softly
opened
and
I
caught
sight
of
a
tall
and
slender
girl
of
twenty
with
a
dark
gypsy
face
golden-brown
eyes
and
hair
black
as
pitch
her
large
white
teeth
gleamed
between
full
red
lips
She
had
on
a
white
dress
a
blue
shawl
pinned
close
round
her
throat
with
a
gold
brooch
half
hid
her
slender
beautiful
arms
in
which
one
could
see
the
fineness
of
her
race
She
took
two
steps
with
the
bashful
awkwardness
of
some
wild
creature
stood
still
and
looked
down
'Come
let
me
introduce
said
Panteley
Eremyitch
'wife
she
is
not
but
she
's
to
be
respected
as
a
wife
Masha
flushed
slightly
and
smiled
in
confusion
I
made
her
a
low
bow
I
thought
her
very
charming
The
delicate
falcon
nose
with
distended
half-transparent
nostrils
the
bold
sweep
of
her
high
eyebrows
the
pale
almost
sunken
cheeks
every
feature
of
her
face
denoted
wilful
passion
and
reckless
devilry
From
under
the
coil
of
her
hair
two
rows
of
little
shining
hairs
ran
down
her
broad
neck
a
sign
of
race
and
vigour
She
went
to
the
window
and
sat
down
I
did
not
want
to
increase
her
embarrassment
and
began
talking
with
Tchertop-hanov
Masha
turned
her
head
slyly
and
began
peeping
from
under
her
eyelids
at
me
stealthily
shyly
and
swiftly
Her
glance
seemed
to
flash
out
like
a
snake
's
sting
Nedopyuskin
sat
beside
her
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
She
smiled
again
When
she
smiled
her
nose
slightly
puckered
up
and
her
upper
lip
was
raised
which
gave
her
face
something
of
the
expression
of
a
cat
or
a
lion
'Oh
but
you
're
one
of
the
hands
off
sort
I
thought
in
my
turn
stealing
a
look
at
her
supple
frame
her
hollow
breast
and
her
quick
angular
movements
'Masha
Tchertop-hanov
asked
'do
n't
you
think
we
ought
to
give
our
visitor
some
entertainment
eh
'We
've
got
some
jam
she
replied
'Well
bring
the
jam
here
and
some
vodka
too
while
you
're
about
it
And
I
say
Masha
he
shouted
after
her
'bring
the
guitar
in
too
'What
's
the
guitar
for
I
'm
not
going
to
sing
'Why
'I
do
n't
want
to
'Oh
nonsense
you
'll
want
to
when
'What
asked
Masha
rapidly
knitting
her
brows
'When
you
're
asked
Tchertop-hanov
went
on
with
some
embarrassment
'Oh
She
went
out
soon
came
back
with
jam
and
vodka
and
again
sat
by
the
window
There
was
still
a
line
to
be
seen
on
her
forehead
the
two
eyebrows
rose
and
drooped
like
a
wasp
's
antennae
Have
you
ever
noticed
reader
what
a
wicked
face
the
wasp
has
'Well
I
thought
'I
'm
in
for
a
storm
The
conversation
flagged
Nedopyuskin
shut
up
completely
and
wore
a
forced
smile
Tchertop-hanov
panted
turned
red
and
opened
his
eyes
wide
I
was
on
the
point
of
taking
leave
Suddenly
Masha
got
up
flung
open
the
window
thrust
out
her
head
and
shouted
lustily
to
a
passing
peasant
woman
'Aksinya
The
woman
started
and
tried
to
turn
round
but
slipped
down
and
flopped
heavily
on
to
a
dung-heap
Masha
threw
herself
back
and
laughed
merrily
Tchertop-hanov
laughed
too
Nedopyuskin
shrieked
with
delight
We
all
revived
The
storm
had
passed
off
in
one
flash
of
lightning
the
air
was
clear
again
Half-an-hour
later
no
one
would
have
recognised
us
we
were
chatting
and
frolicking
like
children
Masha
was
the
merriest
of
all
Tchertop-hanov
simply
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
Her
face
grew
paler
her
nostrils
dilated
her
eyes
glowed
and
darkened
at
the
same
time
It
was
a
wild
creature
at
play
Nedopyuskin
limped
after
her
on
his
short
fat
little
legs
like
a
drake
after
a
duck
Even
Venzor
crawled
out
of
his
hiding-place
in
the
hall
stood
a
moment
in
the
doorway
glanced
at
us
and
suddenly
fell
to
jumping
up
into
the
air
and
barking
Masha
flitted
into
the
other
room
fetched
the
guitar
flung
off
the
shawl
from
her
shoulders
seated
herself
quickly
and
raising
her
head
began
singing
a
gypsy
song
Her
voice
rang
out
vibrating
like
a
glass
bell
when
it
is
struck
it
flamed
up
and
died
away
It
filled
the
heart
with
sweetness
and
pain
Tchertop-hanov
fell
to
dancing
Nedopyuskin
stamped
and
swung
his
legs
in
tune
Masha
was
all
a-quiver
like
birch-bark
in
the
fire
her
delicate
fingers
flew
playfully
over
the
guitar
her
dark-skinned
throat
slowly
heaved
under
the
two
rows
of
amber
All
at
once
she
would
cease
singing
sink
into
exhaustion
and
twang
the
guitar
as
it
were
involuntarily
and
Tchertop-hanov
stood
still
merely
working
his
shoulders
and
turning
round
in
one
place
while
Nedopyuskin
nodded
his
head
like
a
Chinese
figure
then
she
would
break
out
into
song
like
a
mad
thing
drawing
herself
up
and
holding
up
her
head
and
Tchertop-hanov
again
curtsied
down
to
the
ground
leaped
up
to
the
ceiling
spun
round
like
a
top
crying
'Quicker
'Quicker
quicker
quicker
Nedopyuskin
chimed
in
speaking
very
fast
It
was
late
in
the
evening
when
I
left
Bezsonovo
THE
END
OF
TCHERTOP-HANOV
I
It
was
two
years
after
my
visit
that
Panteley
Eremyitch
's
troubles
began
his
real
troubles
Disappointments
disasters
even
misfortunes
he
had
had
before
that
time
but
he
had
paid
no
attention
to
them
and
had
risen
superior
to
them
in
former
days
The
first
blow
that
fell
upon
him
was
the
most
heartrending
for
him
Masha
left
him
What
induced
her
to
forsake
his
roof
where
she
seemed
to
be
so
thoroughly
at
home
it
is
hard
to
say
Tchertop-hanov
to
the
end
of
his
days
clung
to
the
conviction
that
a
certain
young
neighbour
a
retired
captain
of
Uhlans
named
Yaff
was
at
the
root
of
Masha
's
desertion
He
had
taken
her
fancy
according
to
Panteley
Eremyitch
simply
by
constantly
curling
his
moustaches
pomading
himself
to
excess
and
sniggering
significantly
but
one
must
suppose
that
the
vagrant
gypsy
blood
in
Masha
's
veins
had
more
to
do
with
it
However
that
may
have
been
one
fine
summer
evening
Masha
tied
up
a
few
odds
and
ends
in
a
small
bundle
and
walked
out
of
Tchertop-hanov
's
house
For
three
days
before
this
she
had
sat
crouched
up
in
a
corner
huddled
against
the
wall
like
a
wounded
fox
and
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
any
one
she
had
only
turned
her
eyes
about
and
twitched
her
eyebrows
and
faintly
gnashed
her
teeth
and
moved
her
arms
as
though
she
were
wrapping
herself
up
This
mood
had
come
upon
her
before
but
had
never
lasted
long
Tchertop-hanov
knew
that
and
so
he
neither
worried
himself
nor
worried
her
But
when
on
coming
in
from
the
kennels
where
in
his
huntsman
's
words
the
last
two
hounds
'had
departed
he
met
a
servant
girl
who
in
a
trembling
voice
informed
him
that
Marya
Akinfyevna
sent
him
her
greetings
and
left
word
that
she
wished
him
every
happiness
but
she
was
not
coming
back
to
him
any
more
Tchertop-hanov
after
reeling
round
where
he
stood
and
uttering
a
hoarse
yell
rushed
at
once
after
the
runaway
snatching
up
his
pistol
as
he
went
He
overtook
her
a
mile
and
a
half
from
his
house
near
a
birch
wood
on
the
high-road
to
the
district
town
The
sun
was
sinking
on
the
horizon
and
everything
was
suddenly
suffused
with
purple
glow
trees
plants
and
earth
alike
'To
Yaff
to
Yaff
groaned
Tchertop-hanov
directly
he
caught
sight
of
Masha
'Going
to
Yaff
he
repeated
running
up
to
her
and
almost
stumbling
at
every
step
Masha
stood
still
and
turned
round
facing
him
She
stood
with
her
back
to
the
light
and
looked
all
black
as
though
she
had
been
carved
out
of
dark
wood
only
the
whites
of
her
eyes
stood
out
like
silvery
almonds
but
the
eyes
themselves
the
pupils
were
darker
than
ever
She
flung
her
bundle
aside
and
folded
her
arms
'You
are
going
to
Yaff
wretched
girl
repeated
Tchertop-hanov
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
seizing
her
by
the
shoulder
but
meeting
her
eyes
he
was
abashed
and
stood
uneasily
where
he
was
'I
am
not
going
to
Mr
Yaff
Panteley
Eremyitch
replied
Masha
in
soft
even
tones
'it
's
only
I
ca
n't
live
with
you
any
longer
'Ca
n't
live
with
me
Why
not
Have
I
offended
you
in
some
way
Masha
shook
her
head
'You
've
not
offended
me
in
any
way
Panteley
Eremyitch
only
my
heart
is
heavy
in
your
house
Thanks
for
the
past
but
I
ca
n't
stay
no
Tchertop-hanov
was
amazed
he
positively
slapped
his
thighs
and
bounced
up
and
down
in
his
astonishment
'How
is
that
Here
she
's
gone
on
living
with
me
and
known
nothing
but
peace
and
happiness
and
all
of
a
sudden
her
heart
's
heavy
and
she
flings
me
over
She
goes
and
puts
a
kerchief
on
her
head
and
is
gone
She
received
every
respect
like
any
lady
'I
do
n't
care
for
that
in
the
least
Masha
interrupted
'Do
n't
care
for
it
From
a
wandering
gypsy
to
turn
into
a
lady
and
she
does
n't
care
for
it
How
do
n't
you
care
for
it
you
low-born
slave
Do
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
There
's
treachery
hidden
in
it
treachery
He
began
frowning
again
'There
's
no
treachery
in
my
thoughts
and
never
has
been
said
Masha
in
her
distinct
resonant
voice
'I
've
told
you
already
my
heart
was
heavy
'Masha
cried
Tchertop-hanov
striking
himself
a
blow
on
the
chest
with
his
fist
'there
stop
it
hush
you
have
tortured
me
now
it's
enough
O
my
God
think
only
what
Tisha
will
say
you
might
have
pity
on
him
at
least
'Remember
me
to
Tihon
Ivanitch
and
tell
him
Tchertop-hanov
wrung
his
hands
'No
you
are
talking
nonsense
you
are
not
going
Your
Yaff
may
wait
for
you
in
vain
'Mr
Yaff
Masha
was
beginning
'A
fine
Mister
Yaff
Tchertop-hanov
mimicked
her
'He
's
an
underhand
rascal
a
low
cur
that
's
what
he
is
and
a
phiz
like
an
ape
's
For
fully
half-an-hour
Tchertop-hanov
was
struggling
with
Masha
He
came
close
to
her
he
fell
back
he
shook
his
fists
at
her
he
bowed
down
before
her
he
wept
he
scolded
'I
ca
n't
repeated
Masha
'I
am
so
sad
at
heart
devoured
by
weariness
Little
by
little
her
face
assumed
such
an
indifferent
almost
drowsy
expression
that
Tchertop-hanov
asked
her
if
they
had
not
drugged
her
with
laudanum
'It
's
weariness
she
said
for
the
tenth
time
'Then
what
if
I
kill
you
he
cried
suddenly
and
he
pulled
the
pistol
out
of
his
pocket
Masha
smiled
her
face
brightened
'Well
kill
me
Panteley
Eremyitch
as
you
will
but
go
back
I
wo
n't
'You
wo
n't
come
back
Tchertop-hanov
cocked
the
pistol
'I
wo
n't
go
back
my
dearie
Never
in
my
life
will
I
go
back
My
word
is
steadfast
Tchertop-hanov
suddenly
thrust
the
pistol
into
her
hand
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
'Then
you
kill
me
Without
you
I
do
n't
care
to
live
I
have
grown
loathsome
to
you
and
everything
's
loathsome
for
me
Masha
bent
down
took
up
her
bundle
laid
the
pistol
on
the
grass
its
mouth
away
from
Tchertop-hanov
and
went
up
to
him
'Ah
my
dearie
why
torture
yourself
Do
n't
you
know
what
we
gypsy
girls
are
It
's
our
nature
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
it
When
there
comes
weariness
the
divider
and
calls
the
soul
away
to
strange
distant
parts
how
is
one
to
stay
here
Do
n't
forget
your
Masha
you
wo
n't
find
such
another
sweetheart
and
I
wo
n't
forget
you
my
dearie
but
our
life
together
's
over
'I
loved
you
Masha
Tchertop-hanov
muttered
into
the
fingers
in
which
he
had
buried
his
face
'And
I
loved
you
little
friend
Panteley
Eremyitch
'I
love
you
I
love
you
madly
senselessly
and
when
I
think
now
that
you
in
your
right
senses
without
rhyme
or
reason
are
leaving
me
like
this
and
going
to
wander
over
the
face
of
the
earth
well
it
strikes
me
that
if
I
were
n't
a
poor
penniless
devil
you
would
n't
be
throwing
me
over
At
these
words
Masha
only
laughed
'And
he
used
to
say
I
did
n't
care
for
money
she
commented
and
she
gave
Tchertop-hanov
a
vigorous
thump
on
the
shoulder
He
jumped
up
on
to
his
feet
'Come
at
least
you
must
let
me
give
you
some
money
how
can
you
go
like
this
without
a
halfpenny
But
best
of
all
kill
me
I
tell
you
plainly
kill
me
once
for
all
Masha
shook
her
head
again
'Kill
you
Why
get
sent
to
Siberia
my
dearie
Tchertop-hanov
shuddered
'Then
it
's
only
from
that
from
fear
of
penal
servitude
He
rolled
on
the
grass
again
Masha
stood
over
him
in
silence
'I
'm
sorry
for
you
dear
she
said
with
a
sigh
'you
're
a
good
fellow
but
there
's
no
help
for
it
good-bye
She
turned
away
and
took
two
steps
The
night
had
come
on
by
now
and
dim
shadows
were
closing
in
on
all
sides
Tchertop-hanov
jumped
up
swiftly
and
seized
Masha
from
behind
by
her
two
elbows
'You
are
going
away
like
this
serpent
to
Yaff
'Good-bye
Masha
repeated
sharply
and
significantly
she
tore
herself
away
and
walked
off
Tchertop-hanov
looked
after
her
ran
to
the
place
where
the
pistol
was
lying
snatched
it
up
took
aim
fired
But
before
he
touched
the
trigger
his
arm
twitched
upwards
the
ball
whistled
over
Masha
's
head
She
looked
at
him
over
her
shoulder
without
stopping
and
went
on
swinging
as
she
walked
as
though
in
defiance
of
him
He
hid
his
face
and
fell
to
running
But
before
he
had
run
fifty
paces
he
suddenly
stood
still
as
though
turned
to
stone
A
well-known
too
well-known
voice
came
floating
to
him
Masha
was
singing
'It
was
in
the
sweet
days
of
youth
she
sang
every
note
seemed
to
linger
plaintive
and
ardent
in
the
evening
air
Tchertop-hanov
listened
intently
The
voice
retreated
and
retreated
at
one
moment
it
died
away
at
the
next
it
floated
across
hardly
audible
but
still
with
the
same
passionate
glow
'She
does
it
to
spite
me
thought
Tchertop-hanov
but
at
once
he
moaned
'oh
no
it
's
her
last
farewell
to
me
for
ever
and
he
burst
into
floods
of
tears
The
next
day
he
appeared
at
the
lodgings
of
Mr
Yaff
who
as
a
true
man
of
the
world
not
liking
the
solitude
of
the
country
resided
in
the
district
town
'to
be
nearer
the
young
ladies
as
he
expressed
it
Tchertop-hanov
did
not
find
Yaff
he
had
in
the
words
of
his
valet
set
off
for
Moscow
the
evening
before
'Then
it
is
so
cried
Tchertop-hanov
furiously
'there
was
an
arrangement
between
them
she
has
run
away
with
him
but
wait
a
bit
He
broke
into
the
young
cavalry
captain
's
room
in
spite
of
the
resistance
of
the
valet
In
the
room
there
was
hanging
over
the
sofa
a
portrait
in
oils
of
the
master
in
the
Uhlan
uniform
'Ah
here
you
are
you
tailless
ape
thundered
Tchertop-hanov
he
jumped
on
to
the
sofa
and
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
burst
a
big
hole
in
the
taut
canvas
'Tell
your
worthless
master
he
turned
to
the
valet
'that
in
the
absence
of
his
own
filthy
phiz
the
nobleman
Tchertop-hanov
put
a
hole
through
the
painted
one
and
if
he
cares
for
satisfaction
from
me
he
knows
where
to
find
the
nobleman
Tchertop-hanov
or
else
I
'll
find
him
out
myself
I
'll
fetch
the
rascally
ape
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
Saying
these
words
Tchertop-hanov
jumped
off
the
sofa
and
majestically
withdrew
But
the
cavalry
captain
Yaff
did
not
demand
satisfaction
from
him
indeed
he
never
met
him
anywhere
and
Tchertop-hanov
did
not
think
of
seeking
his
enemy
out
and
no
scandal
followed
Masha
herself
soon
after
this
disappeared
beyond
all
trace
Tchertop-hanov
took
to
drink
however
he
'reformed
later
But
then
a
second
blow
fell
upon
him
This
was
the
death
of
his
bosom
friend
Tihon
Ivanovitch
Nedopyuskin
His
health
had
begun
to
fail
two
years
before
his
death
he
began
to
suffer
from
asthma
and
was
constantly
dropping
asleep
and
on
waking
up
could
not
at
once
come
to
himself
the
district
doctor
maintained
that
this
was
the
result
of
'something
rather
like
fits
During
the
three
days
which
preceded
Masha
's
departure
those
three
days
when
'her
heart
was
heavy
Nedopyuskin
had
been
away
at
his
own
place
at
Bezselendyevka
he
had
been
laid
up
with
a
severe
cold
Masha
's
conduct
was
consequently
even
more
unexpected
for
him
it
made
almost
a
deeper
impression
on
him
than
on
Tchertop-hanov
himself
With
his
natural
sweetness
and
diffidence
he
gave
utterance
to
nothing
but
the
tenderest
sympathy
with
his
friend
and
the
most
painful
perplexity
but
it
crushed
and
made
havoc
of
everything
in
him
'She
has
torn
the
heart
out
of
me
he
would
murmur
to
himself
as
he
sat
on
his
favourite
checked
sofa
and
twisted
his
fingers
Even
when
Tchertop-hanov
had
got
over
it
he
Nedopyuskin
did
not
recover
and
still
felt
that
'there
was
a
void
within
him
'Here
he
would
say
pointing
to
the
middle
of
his
breast
above
his
stomach
In
that
way
he
lingered
on
till
the
winter
When
the
frosts
came
his
asthma
got
better
but
he
was
visited
by
not
'something
rather
like
a
fit
this
time
but
a
real
unmistakable
fit
He
did
not
lose
his
memory
at
once
he
still
knew
Tchertop-hanov
and
his
friend's
cry
of
despair
'How
can
you
desert
me
Tisha
without
my
consent
just
as
Masha
did
He
even
responded
with
faltering
uncertain
tongue
'O
P
a
ey
E
e
yitch
I
will
o
bey
you
This
did
not
however
prevent
him
from
dying
the
same
day
without
waiting
for
the
district
doctor
who
on
seeing
the
hardly
cold
body
found
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
with
a
melancholy
recognition
of
the
instability
of
all
things
mortal
to
ask
for
'a
drop
of
vodka
and
a
snack
of
fish
As
might
have
been
anticipated
Tihon
Ivanitch
had
bequeathed
his
property
to
his
revered
patron
and
generous
protector
Panteley
Eremyitch
Tchertop-hanov
but
it
was
of
no
great
benefit
to
the
revered
patron
as
it
was
shortly
after
sold
by
public
auction
partly
in
order
to
cover
the
expense
of
a
sepulchral
monument
a
statue
which
Tchertop-hanov
and
one
can
see
his
father
's
craze
coming
out
in
him
here
had
thought
fit
to
put
up
over
the
ashes
of
his
friend
This
statue
which
was
to
have
represented
an
angel
praying
was
ordered
by
him
from
Moscow
but
the
agent
recommended
to
him
conceiving
that
connoisseurs
in
sculpture
were
not
often
to
be
met
with
in
the
provinces
sent
him
instead
of
an
angel
a
goddess
Flora
which
had
for
many
years
adorned
one
of
those
neglected
gardens
near
Moscow
laid
out
in
the
days
of
Catherine
He
had
an
excellent
reason
for
doing
so
since
this
statue
though
highly
artistic
in
the
rococo
style
with
plump
little
arms
tossing
curls
a
wreath
of
roses
round
the
bare
bosom
and
a
serpentine
figure
was
obtained
by
him
the
agent
for
nothing
And
so
to
this
day
the
mythological
goddess
stands
with
one
foot
elegantly
lifted
above
the
tomb
of
Tihon
Ivanovitch
and
with
a
genuinely
Pompadour
simper
gazes
at
the
calves
and
sheep
those
invariable
visitors
of
our
village
graveyards
as
they
stray
about
her
On
the
loss
of
his
faithful
friend
Tchertop-hanov
again
took
to
drink
and
this
time
far
more
seriously
Everything
went
utterly
to
the
bad
with
him
He
had
no
money
left
for
sport
the
last
of
his
meagre
fortune
was
spent
the
last
of
his
few
servants
ran
away
Panteley
Eremyitch's
isolation
became
complete
he
had
no
one
to
speak
a
word
to
even
far
less
to
open
his
heart
to
His
pride
alone
had
suffered
no
diminution
On
the
contrary
the
worse
his
surroundings
became
the
more
haughty
and
lofty
and
inaccessible
he
was
himself
He
became
a
complete
misanthrope
in
the
end
One
distraction
one
delight
was
left
him
a
superb
grey
horse
of
the
Don
breed
named
by
him
Malek-Adel
a
really
wonderful
animal
This
horse
came
into
his
possession
in
this
fashion
As
he
was
riding
one
day
through
a
neighbouring
village
Tchertop-hanov
heard
a
crowd
of
peasants
shouting
and
hooting
before
a
tavern
In
the
middle
of
the
crowd
stalwart
arms
were
continually
rising
and
falling
in
exactly
the
same
place
'What
is
happening
there
he
asked
in
the
peremptory
tone
peculiar
to
him
of
an
old
peasant
woman
who
was
standing
on
the
threshold
of
her
hut
Leaning
against
the
doorpost
as
though
dozing
the
old
woman
stared
in
the
direction
of
the
tavern
A
white-headed
urchin
in
a
print
smock
with
a
cypress-wood
cross
on
his
little
bare
breast
was
sitting
with
little
outstretched
legs
and
little
clenched
fists
between
her
bast
slippers
a
chicken
close
by
was
chipping
at
a
stale
crust
of
rye-bread
'The
Lord
knows
your
honour
answered
the
old
woman
Bending
forward
she
laid
her
wrinkled
brown
hand
on
the
child
's
head
'They
say
our
lads
are
beating
a
Jew
'A
Jew
What
Jew
'The
Lord
knows
your
honour
A
Jew
came
among
us
and
where
he
's
come
from
who
knows
Vassya
come
to
your
mammy
sir
sh
sh
nasty
brute
The
old
woman
drove
away
the
chicken
while
Vassya
clung
to
her
petticoat
'So
you
see
they
're
beating
him
sir
'Why
beating
him
What
for
'I
do
n't
know
your
honour
No
doubt
he
deserves
it
And
indeed
why
not
beat
him
You
know
your
honour
he
crucified
Christ
Tchertop-hanov
uttered
a
whoop
gave
his
horse
a
lash
on
the
neck
with
the
riding-whip
flew
straight
towards
the
crowd
and
plunging
into
it
began
with
the
same
riding-whip
thrashing
the
peasants
to
left
and
to
right
indiscriminately
shouting
in
broken
tones
'Lawless
brutes
lawless
brutes
It
's
for
the
law
to
punish
and
not
pri-vate
per-sons
The
law
the
law
the
law
Before
two
minutes
had
passed
the
crowd
had
beaten
a
retreat
in
various
directions
and
on
the
ground
before
the
tavern
door
could
be
seen
a
small
thin
swarthy
creature
in
a
nankin
long
coat
dishevelled
and
mangled
a
pale
face
rolling
eyes
open
mouth
What
was
it
deadly
terror
or
death
itself
'Why
have
you
killed
this
Jew
Tchertop-hanov
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
brandishing
his
riding-whip
menacingly
The
crowd
faintly
roared
in
response
One
peasant
was
rubbing
his
shoulder
another
his
side
a
third
his
nose
'You
're
pretty
free
with
your
whip
was
heard
in
the
back
rows
'Why
have
you
killed
the
Jew
you
christened
Pagans
repeated
Tchertop-hanov
But
at
this
point
the
