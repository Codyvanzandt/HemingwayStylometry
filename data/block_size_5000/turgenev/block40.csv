so
much
better
than
here
for
grouse
I
did
not
proceed
to
question
my
faithful
companion
why
he
had
not
taken
me
to
those
parts
before
and
the
same
day
we
made
our
way
to
my
mother
's
peasant
settlement
the
existence
of
which
I
must
confess
I
had
not
even
suspected
up
till
then
At
this
settlement
it
turned
out
there
was
a
little
lodge
It
was
very
old
but
as
it
had
not
been
inhabited
it
was
clean
I
passed
a
fairly
tranquil
night
in
it
The
next
day
I
woke
up
very
early
The
sun
had
only
just
risen
there
was
not
a
single
cloud
in
the
sky
everything
around
shone
with
a
double
brilliance
the
brightness
of
the
fresh
morning
rays
and
of
yesterday's
downpour
While
they
were
harnessing
me
a
cart
I
went
for
a
stroll
about
a
small
orchard
now
neglected
and
run
wild
which
enclosed
the
little
lodge
on
all
sides
with
its
fragrant
sappy
growth
Ah
how
sweet
it
was
in
the
open
air
under
the
bright
sky
where
the
larks
were
trilling
whence
their
bell-like
notes
rained
down
like
silvery
beads
On
their
wings
doubtless
they
had
carried
off
drops
of
dew
and
their
songs
seemed
steeped
in
dew
I
took
my
cap
off
my
head
and
drew
a
glad
deep
breath
On
the
slope
of
a
shallow
ravine
close
to
the
hedge
could
be
seen
a
beehive
a
narrow
path
led
to
it
winding
like
a
snake
between
dense
walls
of
high
grass
and
nettles
above
which
struggled
up
God
knows
whence
brought
the
pointed
stalks
of
dark-green
hemp
I
turned
along
this
path
I
reached
the
beehive
Beside
it
stood
a
little
wattled
shanty
where
they
put
the
beehives
for
the
winter
I
peeped
into
the
half-open
door
it
was
dark
still
dry
within
there
was
a
scent
of
mint
and
balm
In
the
corner
were
some
trestles
fitted
together
and
on
them
covered
with
a
quilt
a
little
figure
of
some
sort
I
was
walking
away
'Master
master
Piotr
Petrovitch
I
heard
a
voice
faint
slow
and
hoarse
like
the
whispering
of
marsh
rushes
I
stopped
'Piotr
Petrovitch
Come
in
please
the
voice
repeated
It
came
from
the
corner
where
were
the
trestles
I
had
noticed
I
drew
near
and
was
struck
dumb
with
amazement
Before
me
lay
a
living
human
being
but
what
sort
of
a
creature
was
it
A
head
utterly
withered
of
a
uniform
coppery
hue
like
some
very
ancient
holy
picture
yellow
with
age
a
sharp
nose
like
a
keen-edged
knife
the
lips
could
barely
be
seen
only
the
teeth
flashed
white
and
the
eyes
and
from
under
the
kerchief
some
thin
wisps
of
yellow
hair
straggled
on
to
the
forehead
At
the
chin
where
the
quilt
was
folded
two
tiny
hands
of
the
same
coppery
hue
were
moving
the
fingers
slowly
twitching
like
little
sticks
I
looked
more
intently
the
face
far
from
being
ugly
was
positively
beautiful
but
strange
and
dreadful
and
the
face
seemed
the
more
dreadful
to
me
that
on
it
on
its
metallic
cheeks
I
saw
struggling
struggling
and
unable
to
form
itself
a
smile
'You
do
n't
recognise
me
master
whispered
the
voice
again
it
seemed
to
be
breathed
from
the
almost
unmoving
lips
'And
indeed
how
should
you
I
'm
Lukerya
Do
you
remember
who
used
to
lead
the
dance
at
your
mother
's
at
Spasskoye
Do
you
remember
I
used
to
be
leader
of
the
choir
too
'Lukerya
I
cried
'Is
it
you
Can
it
be
'Yes
it
's
I
master
I
Lukerya
I
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
gazed
in
stupefaction
at
the
dark
motionless
face
with
the
clear
death-like
eyes
fastened
upon
me
Was
it
possible
This
mummy
Lukerya
the
greatest
beauty
in
all
our
household
that
tall
plump
pink-and-white
singing
laughing
dancing
creature
Lukerya
our
smart
Lukerya
whom
all
our
lads
were
courting
for
whom
I
heaved
some
secret
sighs
I
a
boy
of
sixteen
'Mercy
Lukerya
I
said
at
last
'what
is
it
has
happened
to
you
'Oh
such
a
misfortune
befel
me
But
do
n't
mind
me
sir
do
n't
let
my
trouble
revolt
you
sit
there
on
that
little
tub
a
little
nearer
or
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
hear
me
I
've
not
much
of
a
voice
now-a-days
Well
I
am
glad
to
see
you
What
brought
you
to
Aleksyevka
Lukerya
spoke
very
softly
and
feebly
but
without
pausing
'Yermola
the
huntsman
brought
me
here
But
you
tell
me
'Tell
you
about
my
trouble
Certainly
sir
It
happened
to
me
a
long
while
ago
now
six
or
seven
years
I
had
only
just
been
betrothed
then
to
Vassily
Polyakov
do
you
remember
such
a
fine-looking
fellow
he
was
with
curly
hair
he
waited
at
table
at
your
mother
's
But
you
weren't
in
the
country
then
you
had
gone
away
to
Moscow
to
your
studies
We
were
very
much
in
love
Vassily
and
me
I
could
never
get
him
out
of
my
head
and
it
was
in
the
spring
it
all
happened
Well
one
night
not
long
before
sunrise
it
was
I
could
n't
sleep
a
nightingale
in
the
garden
was
singing
so
wonderfully
sweet
I
could
not
help
getting
up
and
going
out
on
to
the
steps
to
listen
It
trilled
and
trilled
and
all
at
once
I
fancied
some
one
called
me
it
seemed
like
Vassya
's
voice
so
softly
Lusha
I
looked
round
and
being
half
asleep
I
suppose
I
missed
my
footing
and
fell
straight
down
from
the
top-step
and
flop
on
to
the
ground
And
I
thought
I
was
n't
much
hurt
for
I
got
up
directly
and
went
back
to
my
room
Only
it
seems
something
inside
me
in
my
body
was
broken
Let
me
get
my
breath
half
a
minute
sir
Lukerya
ceased
and
I
looked
at
her
with
surprise
What
surprised
me
particularly
was
that
she
told
her
story
almost
cheerfully
without
sighs
and
groans
not
complaining
nor
asking
for
sympathy
'Ever
since
that
happened
Lukerya
went
on
'I
began
to
pine
away
and
get
thin
my
skin
got
dark
walking
was
difficult
for
me
and
then
I
lost
the
use
of
my
legs
altogether
I
could
n't
stand
or
sit
I
had
to
lie
down
all
the
time
And
I
did
n't
care
to
eat
or
drink
I
got
worse
and
worse
Your
mamma
in
the
kindness
of
her
heart
made
me
see
doctors
and
sent
me
to
a
hospital
But
there
was
no
curing
me
And
not
one
doctor
could
even
say
what
my
illness
was
What
did
n't
they
do
to
me
they
burnt
my
spine
with
hot
irons
they
put
me
in
lumps
of
ice
and
it
was
all
no
good
I
got
quite
numb
in
the
end
So
the
gentlemen
decided
it
was
no
use
doctoring
me
any
more
and
there
was
no
sense
in
keeping
cripples
up
at
the
great
house
well
and
so
they
sent
me
here
because
I
've
relations
here
So
here
I
live
as
you
see
Lukerya
was
silent
again
and
again
she
tried
to
smile
'But
this
is
awful
your
position
I
cried
and
not
knowing
how
to
go
on
I
asked
'and
what
of
Vassily
Polyakov
A
most
stupid
question
it
was
Lukerya
turned
her
eyes
a
little
away
'What
of
Polyakov
He
grieved
he
grieved
for
a
bit
and
he
is
married
to
another
a
girl
from
Glinnoe
Do
you
know
Glinnoe
It
's
not
far
from
us
Her
name
's
Agrafena
He
loved
me
dearly
but
you
see
he
's
a
young
man
he
could
n't
stay
a
bachelor
And
what
sort
of
a
helpmeet
could
I
be
The
wife
he
found
for
himself
is
a
good
sweet
woman
and
they
have
children
He
lives
here
he
's
a
clerk
at
a
neighbour
's
your
mamma
let
him
go
off
with
a
passport
and
he
's
doing
very
well
praise
God
'And
so
you
go
on
lying
here
all
the
time
I
asked
again
'Yes
sir
I
've
been
lying
here
seven
years
In
the
summer-time
I
lie
here
in
this
shanty
and
when
it
gets
cold
they
move
me
out
into
the
bath-house
I
lie
there
'Who
waits
on
you
Does
any
one
look
after
you
'Oh
there
are
kind
folks
here
as
everywhere
they
do
n't
desert
me
Yes
they
see
to
me
a
little
As
to
food
I
eat
nothing
to
speak
of
but
water
is
here
in
the
pitcher
it
's
always
kept
full
of
pure
spring
water
I
can
reach
to
the
pitcher
myself
I
've
one
arm
still
of
use
There
's
a
little
girl
here
an
orphan
now
and
then
she
comes
to
see
me
the
kind
child
She
was
here
just
now
You
did
n't
meet
her
Such
a
pretty
fair
little
thing
She
brings
me
flowers
We
've
some
in
the
garden
there
were
some
but
they
've
all
disappeared
But
you
know
wild
flowers
too
are
nice
they
smell
even
sweeter
than
garden
flowers
Lilies
of
the
valley
now
what
could
be
sweeter
'And
are
n't
you
dull
and
miserable
my
poor
Lukerya
'Why
what
is
one
to
do
I
would
n't
tell
a
lie
about
it
At
first
it
was
very
wearisome
but
later
on
I
got
used
to
it
I
got
more
patient
it
was
nothing
there
are
others
worse
off
still
'How
do
you
mean
'Why
some
have
n't
a
roof
to
shelter
them
and
there
are
some
blind
or
deaf
while
I
thank
God
have
splendid
sight
and
hear
everything
everything
If
a
mole
burrows
in
the
ground
I
hear
even
that
And
I
can
smell
every
scent
even
the
faintest
When
the
buckwheat
comes
into
flower
in
the
meadow
or
the
lime-tree
in
the
garden
I
don't
need
to
be
told
of
it
even
I
'm
the
first
to
know
directly
Anyway
if
there
's
the
least
bit
of
a
wind
blowing
from
that
quarter
No
he
who
stirs
God
's
wrath
is
far
worse
off
than
me
Look
at
this
again
anyone
in
health
may
easily
fall
into
sin
but
I
'm
cut
off
even
from
sin
The
other
day
father
Aleksy
the
priest
came
to
give
me
the
sacrament
and
he
says
There
's
no
need
says
he
to
confess
you
you
ca
n't
fall
into
sin
in
your
condition
can
you
But
I
said
to
him
How
about
sinning
in
thought
father
Ah
well
says
he
and
he
laughed
himself
that
's
no
great
sin
'But
I
fancy
I
'm
no
great
sinner
even
in
that
way
in
thought
Lukerya
went
on
'for
I
've
trained
myself
not
to
think
and
above
all
not
to
remember
The
time
goes
faster
I
must
own
I
was
astonished
'You
're
always
alone
Lukerya
how
can
you
prevent
the
thoughts
from
coming
into
your
head
or
are
you
constantly
asleep
'Oh
no
sir
I
ca
n't
always
sleep
Though
I
've
no
great
pain
still
I
've
an
ache
there
right
inside
and
in
my
bones
too
it
wo
n't
let
me
sleep
as
I
ought
No
but
there
I
lie
by
myself
I
lie
here
and
lie
here
and
do
n't
think
I
feel
that
I
'm
alive
I
breathe
and
I
put
myself
all
into
that
I
look
and
listen
The
bees
buzz
and
hum
in
the
hive
a
dove
sits
on
the
roof
and
coos
a
hen
comes
along
with
her
chickens
to
peck
up
crumbs
or
a
sparrow
flies
in
or
a
butterfly
that
's
a
great
treat
for
me
Last
year
some
swallows
even
built
a
nest
over
there
in
the
corner
and
brought
up
their
little
ones
Oh
how
interesting
it
was
One
would
fly
to
the
nest
press
close
feed
a
young
one
and
off
again
Look
again
the
other
would
be
in
her
place
already
Sometimes
it
would
n't
fly
in
but
only
fly
past
the
open
door
and
the
little
ones
would
begin
to
squeak
and
open
their
beaks
directly
I
was
hoping
for
them
back
again
the
next
year
but
they
say
a
sportsman
here
shot
them
with
his
gun
And
what
could
he
gain
by
it
It
's
hardly
bigger
the
swallow
than
a
beetle
What
wicked
men
you
are
you
sportsmen
'I
do
n't
shoot
swallows
I
hastened
to
remark
'And
once
Lukerya
began
again
'it
was
comical
really
A
hare
ran
in
it
did
really
The
hounds
I
suppose
were
after
it
anyway
it
seemed
to
tumble
straight
in
at
the
door
It
squatted
quite
near
me
and
sat
so
a
long
while
it
kept
sniffing
with
its
nose
and
twitching
its
whiskers
like
a
regular
officer
and
it
looked
at
me
It
understood
to
be
sure
that
I
was
no
danger
to
it
At
last
it
got
up
went
hop-hop
to
the
door
looked
round
in
the
doorway
and
what
did
it
look
like
Such
a
funny
fellow
it
was
Lukerya
glanced
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
'Was
n't
it
funny
To
satisfy
her
I
laughed
She
moistened
her
parched
lips
'Well
in
the
winter
of
course
I
'm
worse
off
because
it
's
dark
to
burn
a
candle
would
be
a
pity
and
what
would
be
the
use
I
can
read
to
be
sure
and
was
always
fond
of
reading
but
what
could
I
read
There
are
no
books
of
any
kind
and
even
if
there
were
how
could
I
hold
a
book
Father
Aleksy
brought
me
a
calendar
to
entertain
me
but
he
saw
it
was
no
good
so
he
took
and
carried
it
away
again
But
even
though
it's
dark
there
's
always
something
to
listen
to
a
cricket
chirps
or
a
mouse
begins
scratching
somewhere
That
's
when
it
's
a
good
thing
not
to
think
'And
I
repeat
the
prayers
too
Lukerya
went
on
after
taking
breath
a
little
'only
I
do
n't
know
many
of
them
the
prayers
I
mean
And
besides
why
should
I
weary
the
Lord
God
What
can
I
ask
Him
for
He
knows
better
than
I
what
I
need
He
has
laid
a
cross
upon
me
that
means
that
He
loves
me
So
we
are
commanded
to
understand
I
repeat
the
Lord's
Prayer
the
Hymn
to
the
Virgin
the
Supplication
of
all
the
Afflicted
and
I
lie
still
again
without
any
thought
at
all
and
am
all
right
Two
minutes
passed
by
I
did
not
break
the
silence
and
did
not
stir
on
the
narrow
tub
which
served
me
as
a
seat
The
cruel
stony
stillness
of
the
living
unlucky
creature
lying
before
me
communicated
itself
to
me
I
too
turned
as
it
were
numb
'Listen
Lukerya
I
began
at
last
'listen
to
the
suggestion
I
'm
going
to
make
to
you
Would
you
like
me
to
arrange
for
them
to
take
you
to
a
hospital
a
good
hospital
in
the
town
Who
knows
perhaps
you
might
yet
be
cured
anyway
you
would
not
be
alone
Lukerya
's
eyebrows
fluttered
faintly
'Oh
no
sir
she
answered
in
a
troubled
whisper
'do
n't
move
me
into
a
hospital
do
n't
touch
me
I
shall
only
have
more
agony
to
bear
there
How
could
they
cure
me
now
Why
there
was
a
doctor
came
here
once
he
wanted
to
examine
me
I
begged
him
for
Christ
's
sake
not
to
disturb
me
It
was
no
use
He
began
turning
me
over
pounding
my
hands
and
legs
and
pulling
me
about
He
said
I
'm
doing
this
for
Science
I
'm
a
servant
of
Science
a
scientific
man
And
you
he
said
really
ought
n't
to
oppose
me
because
I
've
a
medal
given
me
for
my
labours
and
it
's
for
you
simpletons
I
'm
toiling
He
mauled
me
about
told
me
the
name
of
my
disease
some
wonderful
long
name
and
with
that
he
went
away
and
all
my
poor
bones
ached
for
a
week
after
You
say
I
'm
all
alone
always
alone
Oh
no
I
'm
not
always
they
come
to
see
me
I
'm
quiet
I
don't
bother
them
The
peasant
girls
come
in
and
chat
a
bit
a
pilgrim
woman
will
wander
in
and
tell
me
tales
of
Jerusalem
of
Kiev
of
the
holy
towns
And
I
'm
not
afraid
of
being
alone
Indeed
it
's
better
ay
ay
Master
do
n't
touch
me
do
n't
take
me
to
the
hospital
Thank
you
you
are
kind
only
do
n't
touch
me
there
's
a
dear
'Well
as
you
like
as
you
like
Lukerya
You
know
I
only
suggested
it
for
your
good
'I
know
master
that
it
was
for
my
good
But
master
dear
who
can
help
another
Who
can
enter
into
his
soul
Every
man
must
help
himself
You
wo
n't
believe
me
perhaps
I
lie
here
sometimes
so
alone
and
it
's
as
though
there
were
no
one
else
in
the
world
but
me
As
if
I
alone
were
living
And
it
seems
to
me
as
though
something
were
blessing
me
I'm
carried
away
by
dreams
that
are
really
marvellous
'What
do
you
dream
of
then
Lukerya
'That
too
master
I
could
n't
say
one
ca
n't
explain
Besides
one
forgets
afterwards
It
's
like
a
cloud
coming
over
and
bursting
then
it
grows
so
fresh
and
sweet
but
just
what
it
was
there
's
no
knowing
Only
my
idea
is
if
folks
were
near
me
I
should
have
nothing
of
that
and
should
feel
nothing
except
my
misfortune
Lukerya
heaved
a
painful
sigh
Her
breathing
like
her
limbs
was
not
under
her
control
'When
I
come
to
think
master
of
you
she
began
again
'you
are
very
sorry
for
me
But
you
must
n't
be
too
sorry
really
I
'll
tell
you
one
thing
for
instance
I
sometimes
even
now
Do
you
remember
how
merry
I
used
to
be
in
my
time
A
regular
madcap
So
do
you
know
what
I
sing
songs
even
now
'Sing
You
'Yes
I
sing
the
old
songs
songs
for
choruses
for
feasts
Christmas
songs
all
sorts
I
know
such
a
lot
of
them
you
see
and
I
've
not
forgotten
them
Only
dance
songs
I
do
n't
sing
In
my
state
now
it
would
n't
suit
me
'How
do
you
sing
them
to
yourself
'To
myself
yes
and
aloud
too
I
ca
n't
sing
loud
but
still
one
can
understand
it
I
told
you
a
little
girl
waits
on
me
A
clever
little
orphan
she
is
So
I
have
taught
her
four
songs
she
has
learnt
from
me
already
Do
n't
you
believe
me
Wait
a
minute
I
'll
show
you
directly
Lukerya
took
breath
The
thought
that
this
half-dead
creature
was
making
ready
to
begin
singing
raised
an
involuntary
feeling
of
dread
in
me
But
before
I
could
utter
a
word
a
long-drawn-out
hardly
audible
but
pure
and
true
note
was
quivering
in
my
ears
it
was
followed
by
a
second
and
a
third
'In
the
meadows
sang
Lukerya
She
sang
the
expression
of
her
stony
face
unchanged
even
her
eyes
riveted
on
one
spot
But
how
touchingly
tinkled
out
that
poor
struggling
little
voice
that
wavered
like
a
thread
of
smoke
how
she
longed
to
pour
out
all
her
soul
in
it
I
felt
no
dread
now
my
heart
throbbed
with
unutterable
pity
'Ah
I
ca
n't
she
said
suddenly
'I
've
not
the
strength
I
'm
so
upset
with
joy
at
seeing
you
She
closed
her
eyes
I
laid
my
hand
on
her
tiny
chill
fingers
She
glanced
at
me
and
her
dark
lids
fringed
with
golden
eyelashes
closed
again
and
were
still
as
an
ancient
statue
's
An
instant
later
they
glistened
in
the
half-darkness
They
were
moistened
by
a
tear
As
before
I
did
not
stir
'How
silly
I
am
said
Lukerya
suddenly
with
unexpected
force
and
opened
her
eyes
wide
she
tried
to
wink
the
tears
out
of
them
'I
ought
to
be
ashamed
What
am
I
doing
It
's
a
long
time
since
I
have
been
like
this
not
since
that
day
when
Vassya-Polyakov
was
here
last
spring
While
he
sat
with
me
and
talked
I
was
all
right
but
when
he
had
gone
away
how
I
did
cry
in
my
loneliness
Where
did
I
get
the
tears
from
But
there
we
girls
get
our
tears
for
nothing
Master
added
Lukerya
'perhaps
you
have
a
handkerchief
If
you
wo
n't
mind
wipe
my
eyes
I
made
haste
to
carry
out
her
desire
and
left
her
the
handkerchief
She
refused
it
at
first
'What
good
's
such
a
gift
to
me
she
said
The
handkerchief
was
plain
enough
but
clean
and
white
Afterwards
she
clutched
it
in
her
weak
fingers
and
did
not
loosen
them
again
As
I
got
used
to
the
darkness
in
which
we
both
were
I
could
clearly
make
out
her
features
could
even
perceive
the
delicate
flush
that
peeped
out
under
the
coppery
hue
of
her
face
could
discover
in
the
face
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
me
traces
of
its
former
beauty
'You
asked
me
master
Lukerya
began
again
'whether
I
sleep
I
sleep
very
little
but
every
time
I
fall
asleep
I
've
dreams
such
splendid
dreams
I
'm
never
ill
in
my
dreams
I
'm
always
so
well
and
young
There
's
one
thing
's
sad
I
wake
up
and
long
for
a
good
stretch
and
I'm
all
as
if
I
were
in
chains
I
once
had
such
an
exquisite
dream
Shall
I
tell
it
you
Well
listen
I
dreamt
I
was
standing
in
a
meadow
and
all
round
me
was
rye
so
tall
and
ripe
as
gold
and
I
had
a
reddish
dog
with
me
such
a
wicked
dog
it
kept
trying
to
bite
me
And
I
had
a
sickle
in
my
hands
not
a
simple
sickle
it
seemed
to
be
the
moon
itself
the
moon
as
it
is
when
it
's
the
shape
of
a
sickle
And
with
this
same
moon
I
had
to
cut
the
rye
clean
Only
I
was
very
weary
with
the
heat
and
the
moon
blinded
me
and
I
felt
lazy
and
cornflowers
were
growing
all
about
and
such
big
ones
And
they
all
turned
their
heads
to
me
And
I
thought
in
my
dream
I
would
pick
them
Vassya
had
promised
to
come
so
I
'd
pick
myself
a
wreath
first
I
'd
still
time
to
plait
it
I
began
picking
cornflowers
but
they
kept
melting
away
from
between
my
fingers
do
what
I
would
And
I
could
n't
make
myself
a
wreath
And
meanwhile
I
heard
someone
coming
up
to
me
so
close
and
calling
Lusha
Lusha
Ah
I
thought
what
a
pity
I
had
n't
time
No
matter
I
put
that
moon
on
my
head
instead
of
cornflowers
I
put
it
on
like
a
tiara
and
I
was
all
brightness
directly
I
made
the
whole
field
light
around
me
And
behold
over
the
very
top
of
the
ears
there
came
gliding
very
quickly
towards
me
not
Vassya
but
Christ
Himself
And
how
I
knew
it
was
Christ
I
ca
n't
say
they
do
n't
paint
Him
like
that
only
it
was
He
No
beard
tall
young
all
in
white
only
His
belt
was
golden
and
He
held
out
His
hand
to
me
Fear
not
said
He
My
bride
adorned
follow
Me
you
shall
lead
the
choral
dance
in
the
heavenly
kingdom
and
sing
the
songs
of
Paradise
And
how
I
clung
to
His
hand
My
dog
at
once
followed
at
my
heels
but
then
we
began
to
float
upwards
He
in
front
His
wings
spread
wide
over
all
the
sky
long
like
a
sea-gull
's
and
I
after
Him
And
my
dog
had
to
stay
behind
Then
only
I
understood
that
that
dog
was
my
illness
and
that
in
the
heavenly
kingdom
there
was
no
place
for
it
Lukerya
paused
a
minute
'And
I
had
another
dream
too
she
began
again
'but
may
be
it
was
a
vision
I
really
do
n't
know
It
seemed
to
me
I
was
lying
in
this
very
shanty
and
my
dead
parents
father
and
mother
come
to
me
and
bow
low
to
me
but
say
nothing
And
I
asked
them
Why
do
you
bow
down
to
me
father
and
mother
Because
they
said
you
suffer
much
in
this
world
so
that
you
have
not
only
set
free
your
own
soul
but
have
taken
a
great
burden
from
off
us
too
And
for
us
in
the
other
world
it
is
much
easier
You
have
made
an
end
of
your
own
sins
now
you
are
expiating
our
sins
And
having
said
this
my
parents
bowed
down
to
me
again
and
I
could
not
see
them
there
was
nothing
but
the
walls
to
be
seen
I
was
in
great
doubt
afterwards
what
had
happened
with
me
I
even
told
the
priest
of
it
in
confession
Only
he
thinks
it
was
not
a
vision
because
visions
come
only
to
the
clerical
gentry
'And
I
'll
tell
you
another
dream
Lukerya
went
on
'I
dreamt
I
was
sitting
on
the
high-road
under
a
willow
I
had
a
stick
had
a
wallet
on
my
shoulders
and
my
head
tied
up
in
a
kerchief
just
like
a
pilgrim
woman
And
I
had
to
go
somewhere
a
long
long
way
off
on
a
pilgrimage
And
pilgrims
kept
coming
past
me
they
came
along
slowly
all
going
one
way
their
faces
were
weary
and
all
very
much
like
one
another
And
I
dreamt
that
moving
about
among
them
was
a
woman
a
head
taller
than
the
rest
and
wearing
a
peculiar
dress
not
like
ours
not
Russian
And
her
face
too
was
peculiar
a
worn
face
and
severe
And
all
the
others
moved
away
from
her
but
she
suddenly
turns
and
comes
straight
to
me
She
stood
still
and
looked
at
me
and
her
eyes
were
yellow
large
and
clear
as
a
falcon
's
And
I
ask
her
Who
are
you
And
she
says
to
me
I
'm
your
death
Instead
of
being
frightened
it
was
quite
the
other
way
I
was
as
pleased
as
could
be
I
crossed
myself
And
the
woman
my
death
says
to
me
I
'm
sorry
for
you
Lukerya
but
I
ca
n't
take
you
with
me
Farewell
Good
God
how
sad
I
was
then
Take
me
said
I
good
mother
take
me
darling
And
my
death
turned
to
me
and
began
speaking
to
me
I
knew
that
she
was
appointing
me
my
hour
but
indistinctly
incomprehensibly
After
St
Peter
's
day
said
she
With
that
I
awoke
Yes
I
have
such
wonderful
dreams
Lukerya
turned
her
eyes
upwards
and
sank
into
thought
'Only
the
sad
thing
is
sometimes
a
whole
week
will
go
by
without
my
getting
to
sleep
once
Last
year
a
lady
came
to
see
me
and
she
gave
me
a
little
bottle
of
medicine
against
sleeplessness
she
told
me
to
take
ten
drops
at
a
time
It
did
me
so
much
good
and
I
used
to
sleep
only
the
bottle
was
all
finished
long
ago
Do
you
know
what
medicine
that
was
and
how
to
get
it
The
lady
had
obviously
given
Lukerya
opium
I
promised
to
get
her
another
bottle
like
it
and
could
not
refrain
from
again
wondering
aloud
at
her
patience
'Ah
master
she
answered
'why
do
you
say
so
What
do
you
mean
by
patience
There
Simeon
Stylites
now
had
patience
certainly
great
patience
for
thirty
years
he
stood
on
a
pillar
And
another
saint
had
himself
buried
in
the
earth
right
up
to
his
breast
and
the
ants
ate
his
face
And
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
was
told
by
a
good
scholar
there
was
once
a
country
and
the
Ishmaelites
made
war
on
it
and
they
tortured
and
killed
all
the
inhabitants
and
do
what
they
would
the
people
could
not
get
rid
of
them
And
there
appeared
among
these
people
a
holy
virgin
she
took
a
great
sword
put
on
armour
weighing
eighty
pounds
went
out
against
the
Ishmaelites
and
drove
them
all
beyond
the
sea
Only
when
she
had
driven
them
out
she
said
to
them
Now
burn
me
for
that
was
my
vow
that
I
would
die
a
death
by
fire
for
my
people
And
the
Ishmaelites
took
her
and
burnt
her
and
the
people
have
been
free
ever
since
then
That
was
a
noble
deed
now
But
what
am
I
I
wondered
to
myself
whence
and
in
what
shape
the
legend
of
Joan
of
Arc
had
reached
her
and
after
a
brief
silence
I
asked
Lukerya
how
old
she
was
'Twenty-eight
or
nine
It
wo
n't
be
thirty
But
why
count
the
years
I
've
something
else
to
tell
you
Lukerya
suddenly
gave
a
sort
of
choked
cough
and
groaned
'You
are
talking
a
great
deal
I
observed
to
her
'it
may
be
bad
for
you
'It
's
true
she
whispered
hardly
audibly
'it
's
time
to
end
our
talk
but
what
does
it
matter
Now
when
you
leave
me
I
can
be
silent
as
long
as
I
like
Any
way
I
've
opened
my
heart
I
began
bidding
her
good-bye
I
repeated
my
promise
to
send
her
the
medicine
and
asked
her
once
more
to
think
well
and
tell
me
if
there
was
n't
anything
she
wanted
'I
want
nothing
I
am
content
with
all
thank
God
she
articulated
with
very
great
effort
but
with
emotion
'God
give
good
health
to
all
But
there
master
you
might
speak
a
word
to
your
mamma
the
peasants
here
are
poor
if
she
could
take
the
least
bit
off
their
rent
They
've
not
land
enough
and
no
advantages
They
would
pray
to
God
for
you
But
I
want
nothing
I
'm
quite
contented
with
all
I
gave
Lukerya
my
word
that
I
would
carry
out
her
request
and
had
already
walked
to
the
door
She
called
me
back
again
'Do
you
remember
master
she
said
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
something
