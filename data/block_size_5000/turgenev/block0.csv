A
STUDY
We
all
settled
down
in
a
circle
and
our
good
friend
Alexandr
Vassilyevitch
Ridel
his
surname
was
German
but
he
was
Russian
to
the
marrow
of
his
bones
began
as
follows
I
am
going
to
tell
you
a
story
friends
of
something
that
happened
to
me
in
the
'thirties
forty
years
ago
as
you
see
I
will
be
brief
and
do
n't
you
interrupt
me
I
was
living
at
the
time
in
Petersburg
and
had
only
just
left
the
University
My
brother
was
a
lieutenant
in
the
horse-guard
artillery
His
battery
was
stationed
at
Krasnoe
Selo
it
was
summer
time
My
brother
lodged
not
at
Krasnoe
Selo
itself
but
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
villages
I
stayed
with
him
more
than
once
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
all
his
comrades
He
was
living
in
a
fairly
decent
cottage
together
with
another
officer
of
his
battery
whose
name
was
Ilya
Stepanitch
Tyeglev
I
became
particularly
friendly
with
him
Marlinsky
is
out
of
date
now
no
one
reads
him
and
even
his
name
is
jeered
at
but
in
the
'thirties
his
fame
was
above
everyone
's
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
young
people
of
the
day
Pushkin
could
not
hold
candle
to
him
He
not
only
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
the
foremost
Russian
writer
but
something
much
more
difficult
and
more
rarely
met
with
he
did
to
some
extent
leave
his
mark
on
his
generation
One
came
across
heroes
la
Marlinsky
everywhere
especially
in
the
provinces
and
especially
among
infantry
and
artillery
men
they
talked
and
corresponded
in
his
language
behaved
with
gloomy
reserve
in
society
with
tempest
in
the
soul
and
flame
in
the
blood
like
Lieutenant
Byelosov
in
the
Frigate
Hope
Women
's
hearts
were
devoured
by
them
The
adjective
applied
to
them
in
those
days
was
fatal
The
type
as
we
all
know
survived
for
many
years
to
the
days
of
Petchorin

in
Lermontov

Translator

Note
All
sorts
of
elements
were
mingled
in
that
type
Byronism
romanticism
reminiscences
of
the
French
Revolution
of
the
Dekabrists
and
the
worship
of
Napoleon
faith
in
destiny
in
one
's
star
in
strength
of
will
pose
and
fine
phrases
and
a
miserable
sense
of
the
emptiness
of
life
uneasy
pangs
of
petty
vanity
and
genuine
strength
and
daring
generous
impulses
and
defective
education
ignorance
aristocratic
airs
and
delight
in
trivial
foppery
But
enough
of
these
general
reflections
I
promised
to
tell
you
the
story
Lieutenant
Tyeglev
belonged
precisely
to
the
class
of
those
fatal
individuals
though
he
did
not
possess
the
exterior
commonly
associated
with
them
he
was
not
for
instance
in
the
least
like
Lermontov
's
fatalist
He
was
a
man
of
medium
height
fairly
solid
and
round-shouldered
with
fair
almost
white
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
he
had
a
round
fresh
rosy-cheeked
face
a
turn-up
nose
a
low
forehead
with
the
hair
growing
thick
over
the
temples
and
full
well-shaped
always
immobile
lips
he
never
laughed
never
even
smiled
Only
when
he
was
tired
and
out
of
heart
he
showed
his
square
teeth
white
as
sugar
The
same
artificial
immobility
was
imprinted
on
all
his
features
had
it
not
been
for
that
they
would
have
had
a
good-natured
expression
His
small
green
eyes
with
yellow
lashes
were
the
only
thing
not
quite
ordinary
in
his
face
his
right
eye
was
very
slightly
higher
than
his
left
and
the
left
eyelid
drooped
a
little
which
made
his
eyes
look
different
strange
and
drowsy
Tyeglev's
countenance
which
was
not
however
without
a
certain
attractiveness
almost
always
wore
an
expression
of
discontent
mingled
with
perplexity
as
though
he
were
chasing
within
himself
a
gloomy
thought
which
he
was
never
able
to
catch
At
the
same
time
he
did
not
give
one
the
impression
of
being
stuck
up
he
might
rather
have
been
taken
for
an
aggrieved
than
a
haughty
man
He
spoke
very
little
hesitatingly
in
a
husky
voice
with
unnecessary
repetitions
Unlike
most
fatalists
he
did
not
use
particularly
elaborate
expressions
in
speaking
and
only
had
recourse
to
them
in
writing
his
handwriting
was
quite
like
a
child
's
His
superiors
regarded
him
as
an
officer
of
no
great
merit
not
particularly
capable
and
not
over-zealous
The
brigadier-general
a
man
of
German
extraction
used
to
say
of
him
He
has
punctuality
but
not
precision
With
the
soldiers
too
Tyeglev
had
the
character
of
being
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
He
lived
modestly
in
accordance
with
his
means
He
had
been
left
an
orphan
at
nine
years
old
his
father
and
mother
were
drowned
when
they
were
being
ferried
across
the
Oka
in
the
spring
floods
He
had
been
educated
at
a
private
school
where
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
slowest
and
quietest
of
the
boys
and
at
his
own
earnest
desire
and
through
the
good
offices
of
a
cousin
who
was
a
man
of
influence
he
obtained
a
commission
in
the
horse-guards
artillery
and
though
with
some
difficulty
passed
his
examination
first
as
an
ensign
and
then
as
a
second
lieutenant
His
relations
with
other
officers
were
somewhat
strained
He
was
not
liked
was
rarely
visited
and
he
hardly
went
to
see
anyone
He
felt
the
presence
of
strangers
a
constraint
he
instantly
became
awkward
and
unnatural
he
had
no
instinct
for
comradeship
and
was
not
on
really
intimate
terms
with
anyone
But
he
was
respected
and
respected
not
for
his
character
nor
for
his
intelligence
and
education
but
because
the
stamp
which
distinguishes
fatal
people
was
discerned
in
him
No
one
of
his
fellow
officers
expected
that
Tyeglev
would
make
a
career
or
distinguish
himself
in
any
way
but
that
Tyeglev
might
do
something
extraordinary
or
that
Tyeglev
might
become
a
Napoleon
was
not
considered
impossible
For
that
is
a
matter
of
a
man
's
star
and
he
was
regarded
as
a
man
of
destiny
just
as
there
are
men
of
sighs
and
of
tears
Two
incidents
that
marked
the
first
steps
in
his
career
did
a
great
deal
to
strengthen
his
fatal
reputation
On
the
very
first
day
after
receiving
his
commission
about
the
middle
of
March
he
was
walking
with
other
newly
promoted
officers
in
full
dress
uniform
along
the
embankment
The
spring
had
come
early
that
year
the
Neva
was
melting
the
bigger
blocks
of
ice
had
gone
but
the
whole
river
was
choked
up
with
a
dense
mass
of
thawing
icicles
The
young
men
were
talking
and
laughing
suddenly
one
of
them
stopped
he
saw
a
little
dog
some
twenty
paces
from
the
bank
on
the
slowly
moving
surface
of
the
river
Perched
on
a
projecting
piece
of
ice
it
was
whining
and
trembling
all
over
It
will
be
drowned
said
the
officer
through
his
teeth
The
dog
was
slowly
being
carried
past
one
of
the
sloping
gangways
that
led
down
to
the
river
All
at
once
Tyeglev
without
saying
a
word
ran
down
this
gangway
and
over
the
thin
ice
sinking
in
and
leaping
out
again
reached
the
dog
seized
it
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
getting
safely
back
to
the
bank
put
it
down
on
the
pavement
The
danger
to
which
Tyeglev
had
exposed
himself
was
so
great
his
action
was
so
unexpected
that
his
companions
were
dumbfoundered
and
only
spoke
all
at
once
when
he
had
called
a
cab
to
drive
home
his
uniform
was
wet
all
over
In
response
to
their
exclamations
Tyeglev
replied
coolly
that
there
was
no
escaping
one
's
destiny
and
told
the
cabman
to
drive
on
You
might
at
least
take
the
dog
with
you
as
a
souvenir
cried
one
of
the
officers
But
Tyeglev
merely
waved
his
hand
and
his
comrades
looked
at
each
other
in
silent
amazement
The
second
incident
occurred
a
few
days
later
at
a
card
party
at
the
battery
commander
's
Tyeglev
sat
in
the
corner
and
took
no
part
in
the
play
Oh
if
only
I
had
a
grandmother
to
tell
me
beforehand
what
cards
will
win
as
in
Pushkin
's
Queen
of
Spades
cried
a
lieutenant
whose
losses
had
nearly
reached
three
thousand
Tyeglev
approached
the
table
in
silence
took
up
a
pack
cut
it
and
saying
the
six
of
diamonds
turned
the
pack
up
the
six
of
diamonds
was
the
bottom
card
The
ace
of
clubs
he
said
and
cut
again
the
bottom
card
turned
out
to
be
the
ace
of
clubs
The
king
of
diamonds
he
said
for
the
third
time
in
an
angry
whisper
through
his
clenched
teeth
and
he
was
right
the
third
time
too
and
he
suddenly
turned
crimson
He
probably
had
not
expected
it
himself
A
capital
trick
Do
it
again
observed
the
commanding
officer
of
the
battery
I
do
n't
go
in
for
tricks
Tyeglev
answered
drily
and
walked
into
the
other
room
How
it
happened
that
he
guessed
the
card
right
I
ca
n't
pretend
to
explain
but
I
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
Many
of
the
players
present
tried
to
do
the
same
and
not
one
of
them
succeeded
one
or
two
did
guess
one
card
but
never
two
in
succession
And
Tyeglev
had
guessed
three
This
incident
strengthened
still
further
his
reputation
as
a
mysterious
fatal
character
It
has
often
occurred
to
me
since
that
if
he
had
not
succeeded
in
the
trick
with
the
cards
there
is
no
knowing
what
turn
it
would
have
taken
and
how
he
would
have
looked
at
himself
but
this
unexpected
success
clinched
the
matter
It
may
well
be
understood
that
Tyeglev
clutched
at
this
reputation
It
gave
him
a
special
significance
a
special
colour
Cela
le
posait
as
the
French
express
it
and
with
his
limited
intelligence
scanty
education
and
immense
vanity
such
a
reputation
just
suited
him
It
was
difficult
to
acquire
it
but
to
keep
it
up
cost
nothing
he
had
only
to
remain
silent
and
hold
himself
aloof
But
it
was
not
owing
to
this
reputation
that
I
made
friends
with
Tyeglev
and
I
may
say
grew
fond
of
him
I
liked
him
in
the
first
place
because
I
was
rather
an
unsociable
creature
myself
and
saw
in
him
one
of
my
own
sort
and
secondly
because
he
was
a
very
good-natured
fellow
and
in
reality
very
simple-hearted
He
aroused
in
me
a
feeling
of
something
like
compassion
it
seemed
to
me
that
apart
from
his
affected
fatality
he
really
was
weighed
down
by
a
tragic
fate
which
he
did
not
himself
suspect
I
need
hardly
say
I
did
not
express
this
feeling
to
him
could
anything
be
more
insulting
to
a
fatal
hero
than
to
be
an
object
of
pity
And
Tyeglev
on
his
side
was
well-disposed
to
me
with
me
he
felt
at
ease
with
me
he
used
to
talk
in
my
presence
he
ventured
to
leave
the
strange
pedestal
on
which
he
had
been
placed
either
by
his
own
efforts
or
by
chance
Agonisingly
morbidly
vain
as
he
was
yet
he
was
probably
aware
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
that
there
was
nothing
to
justify
his
vanity
and
that
others
might
perhaps
look
down
on
him
but
I
a
boy
of
nineteen
put
no
constraint
on
him
the
dread
of
saying
something
stupid
inappropriate
did
not
oppress
his
ever-apprehensive
heart
in
my
presence
He
sometimes
even
chattered
freely
and
well
it
was
for
him
that
no
one
heard
his
chatter
except
me
His
reputation
would
not
have
lasted
long
He
not
only
knew
very
little
but
read
hardly
anything
and
confined
himself
to
picking
up
stories
and
anecdotes
of
a
certain
kind
He
believed
in
presentiments
predictions
omens
meetings
lucky
and
unlucky
days
in
the
persecution
and
benevolence
of
destiny
in
the
mysterious
significance
of
life
in
fact
He
even
believed
in
certain
climacteric
years
which
someone
had
mentioned
in
his
presence
and
the
meaning
of
which
he
did
not
himself
very
well
understand
Fatal
men
of
the
true
stamp
ought
not
to
betray
such
beliefs
they
ought
to
inspire
them
in
others
But
I
was
the
only
one
who
knew
Tyeglev
on
that
side
One
day
I
remember
it
was
St
Elijah
's
day
July
20th
I
came
to
stay
with
my
brother
and
did
not
find
him
at
home
he
had
been
ordered
off
for
a
whole
week
somewhere
I
did
not
want
to
go
back
to
Petersburg
I
sauntered
about
the
neighbouring
marshes
killed
a
brace
of
snipe
and
spent
the
evening
with
Tyeglev
under
the
shelter
of
an
empty
barn
where
he
had
as
he
expressed
it
set
up
his
summer
residence
We
had
a
little
conversation
but
for
the
most
part
drank
tea
smoked
pipes
and
talked
sometimes
to
our
host
a
Russianised
Finn
or
to
the
pedlar
who
used
to
hang
about
the
battery
selling
fi-ine
oranges
and
lemons
a
charming
and
lively
person
who
in
addition
to
other
talents
could
play
the
guitar
and
used
to
tell
us
of
the
unhappy
love
which
he
cherished
in
his
young
days
for
the
daughter
of
a
policeman
Now
that
he
was
older
this
Don
Juan
in
a
gay
cotton
shirt
had
no
experience
of
unsuccessful
love
affairs
Before
the
doors
of
our
barn
stretched
a
wide
plain
gradually
sloping
away
in
the
distance
a
little
river
gleamed
here
and
there
in
the
winding
hollows
low
growing
woods
could
be
seen
further
on
the
horizon
Night
was
coming
on
and
we
were
left
alone
As
night
fell
a
fine
damp
mist
descended
upon
the
earth
and
growing
thicker
and
thicker
passed
into
a
dense
fog
The
moon
rose
up
into
the
sky
the
fog
was
soaked
through
and
through
and
as
it
were
shimmering
with
golden
light
Everything
was
strangely
shifting
veiled
and
confused
the
faraway
looked
near
the
near
looked
far
away
what
was
big
looked
small
and
what
was
small
looked
big
everything
became
dim
and
full
of
light
We
seemed
to
be
in
fairyland
in
a
world
of
whitish-golden
mist
deep
stillness
delicate
sleep
And
how
mysteriously
like
sparks
of
silver
the
stars
filtered
through
the
mist
We
were
both
silent
The
fantastic
beauty
of
the
night
worked
upon
us
it
put
us
into
the
mood
for
the
fantastic
Tyeglev
was
the
first
to
speak
and
talked
with
his
usual
hesitating
incompleted
sentences
and
repetitions
about
presentiments
about
ghosts
On
exactly
such
a
night
according
to
him
one
of
his
friends
a
student
who
had
just
taken
the
place
of
tutor
to
two
orphans
and
was
sleeping
with
them
in
a
lodge
in
the
garden
saw
a
woman
's
figure
bending
over
their
beds
and
next
day
recognised
the
figure
in
a
portrait
of
the
mother
of
the
orphans
which
he
had
not
previously
noticed
Then
Tyeglev
told
me
that
his
parents
had
heard
for
several
days
before
their
death
the
sound
of
rushing
water
that
his
grandfather
had
been
saved
from
death
in
the
battle
of
Borodino
through
suddenly
stooping
down
to
pick
up
a
simple
grey
pebble
at
the
very
instant
when
a
volley
of
grape-shot
flew
over
his
head
and
broke
his
long
black
plume
Tyeglev
even
promised
to
show
me
the
very
pebble
which
had
saved
his
grandfather
and
which
he
had
mounted
into
a
medallion
Then
he
talked
of
the
lofty
destination
of
every
man
and
of
his
own
in
particular
and
added
that
he
still
believed
in
it
and
that
if
he
ever
had
any
doubts
on
that
subject
he
would
know
how
to
be
rid
of
them
and
of
his
life
as
life
would
then
lose
all
significance
for
him
You
imagine
perhaps
he
brought
out
glancing
askance
at
me
that
I
should
n't
have
the
spirit
to
do
it
You
do
n't
know
me
I
have
a
will
of
iron
Well
said
I
thought
to
myself
Tyeglev
pondered
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
dropping
his
chibouk
out
of
his
hand
informed
me
that
that
day
was
a
very
important
one
for
him
This
is
the
prophet
Elijah
's
day
my
name
day
It
is
it
is
always
for
me
a
difficult
time
I
made
no
answer
and
only
looked
at
him
as
he
sat
facing
me
bent
round-shouldered
and
clumsy
with
his
drowsy
lustreless
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
An
old
beggar
woman
Tyeglev
never
let
a
single
beggar
pass
without
giving
alms
told
me
to-day
he
went
on
that
she
would
pray
for
my
soul
Is
n't
that
strange
Why
does
the
man
want
to
be
always
bothering
about
himself
I
thought
again
I
must
add
however
that
of
late
I
had
begun
noticing
an
unusual
expression
of
anxiety
and
uneasiness
on
Tyeglev
's
face
and
it
was
not
a
fatal
melancholy
something
really
was
fretting
and
worrying
him
On
this
occasion
too
I
was
struck
by
the
dejected
expression
of
his
face
Were
not
those
very
doubts
of
which
he
had
spoken
to
me
beginning
to
assail
him
Tyeglev
's
comrades
had
told
me
that
not
long
before
he
had
sent
to
the
authorities
a
project
for
some
reforms
in
the
artillery
department
and
that
the
project
had
been
returned
to
him
with
a
comment
that
is
a
reprimand
Knowing
his
character
I
had
no
doubt
that
such
contemptuous
treatment
by
his
superior
officers
had
deeply
mortified
him
But
the
change
that
I
fancied
I
saw
in
Tyeglev
was
more
like
sadness
and
there
was
a
more
personal
note
about
it
It
's
getting
damp
though
he
brought
out
at
last
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
Let
us
go
into
the
hut
and
it
's
bed-time
too
He
had
the
habit
of
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
putting
his
right
hand
to
his
throat
as
he
did
so
as
though
his
cravat
were
constricting
it
Tyeglev
's
character
was
expressed
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
me
in
this
uneasy
and
nervous
movement
He
too
felt
constricted
in
the
world
We
went
back
into
the
hut
and
both
lay
down
on
benches
he
in
the
corner
facing
the
door
and
I
on
the
opposite
side
Tyeglev
was
for
a
long
time
turning
from
side
to
side
on
his
bench
and
I
could
not
get
to
sleep
either
Whether
his
stories
had
excited
my
nerves
or
the
strange
night
had
fevered
my
blood
anyway
I
could
not
go
to
sleep
All
inclination
for
sleep
disappeared
at
last
and
I
lay
with
my
eyes
open
and
thought
thought
intensely
goodness
knows
of
what
of
most
senseless
trifles
as
always
happens
when
one
is
sleepless
Turning
from
side
to
side
I
stretched
out
my
hands
My
finger
hit
one
of
the
beams
of
the
wall
It
emitted
a
faint
but
resounding
and
as
it
were
prolonged
note
I
must
have
struck
a
hollow
place
I
tapped
again
this
time
on
purpose
The
same
sound
was
repeated
I
knocked
again
All
at
once
Tyeglev
raised
his
head
Ridel
he
said
do
you
hear
Someone
is
knocking
under
the
window
I
pretended
to
be
asleep
The
fancy
suddenly
took
me
to
play
a
trick
at
the
expense
of
my
fatal
friend
I
could
not
sleep
anyway
He
let
his
head
sink
on
the
pillow
I
waited
for
a
little
and
again
knocked
three
times
in
succession
Tyeglev
sat
up
again
and
listened
I
tapped
again
I
was
lying
facing
him
but
he
could
not
see
my
hand
I
put
it
behind
me
under
the
bedclothes
Ridel
cried
Tyeglev
I
did
not
answer
Ridel
he
repeated
loudly
Ridel
Eh
What
is
it
I
said
as
though
just
waking
up
Do
n't
you
hear
someone
keeps
knocking
under
the
window
wants
to
come
in
I
suppose
Some
passer-by
I
muttered
Then
we
must
let
him
in
or
find
out
who
it
is
But
I
made
no
answer
pretending
to
be
asleep
Several
minutes
passed
I
tapped
again
Tyeglev
sat
up
at
once
and
listened
Knock
knock
knock
Knock
knock
knock
Through
my
half-closed
eyelids
in
the
whitish
light
of
the
night
I
could
distinctly
see
every
movement
he
made
He
turned
his
face
first
to
the
window
then
to
the
door
It
certainly
was
difficult
to
make
out
where
the
sound
came
from
it
seemed
to
float
round
the
room
to
glide
along
the
walls
I
had
accidentally
hit
upon
a
kind
of
sounding
board
Ridel
cried
Tyeglev
at
last
Ridel
Ridel
Why
what
is
it
I
asked
yawning
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
n't
hear
anything
There
is
someone
knocking
Well
what
if
there
is
I
answered
and
again
pretended
to
be
asleep
and
even
snored
Tyeglev
subsided
Knock
knock
knock
Who
is
there
Tyeglev
shouted
Come
in
No
one
answered
of
course
Knock
knock
knock
Tyeglev
jumped
out
of
bed
opened
the
window
and
thrusting
out
his
head
cried
wildly
Who
is
there
Who
is
knocking
Then
he
opened
the
door
and
repeated
his
question
A
horse
neighed
in
the
distance
that
was
all
He
went
back
towards
his
bed
Knock
knock
knock
Tyeglev
instantly
turned
round
and
sat
down
Knock
knock
knock
He
rapidly
put
on
his
boots
threw
his
overcoat
over
his
shoulders
and
unhooking
his
sword
from
the
wall
went
out
of
the
hut
I
heard
him
walk
round
it
twice
asking
all
the
time
Who
is
there
Who
goes
there
Who
is
knocking
Then
he
was
suddenly
silent
stood
still
outside
near
the
corner
where
I
was
lying
and
without
uttering
another
word
came
back
into
the
hut
and
lay
down
without
taking
off
his
boots
and
overcoat
Knock
knock
knock
I
began
again
Knock
knock
knock
But
Tyeglev
did
not
stir
did
not
ask
who
was
knocking
and
merely
propped
his
head
on
his
hand
Seeing
that
this
no
longer
acted
after
an
interval
I
pretended
to
wake
up
and
looking
at
Tyeglev
assumed
an
air
of
astonishment
Have
you
been
out
I
asked
Yes
he
answered
unconcernedly
Did
you
still
hear
the
knocking
Yes
And
you
met
no
one
No
And
did
the
knocking
stop
I
do
n't
know
I
do
n't
care
now
Now
Why
now
Tyeglev
did
not
answer
I
felt
a
little
ashamed
and
a
little
vexed
with
him
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
acknowledge
my
prank
however
Do
you
know
what
I
began
I
am
convinced
that
it
was
all
your
imagination
Tyeglev
frowned
Ah
you
think
so
You
say
you
heard
a
knocking
It
was
not
only
knocking
I
heard
Why
what
else
Tyeglev
bent
forward
and
bit
his
lips
He
was
evidently
hesitating
I
was
called
he
brought
out
at
last
in
a
low
voice
and
turned
away
his
face
You
were
called
Who
called
you
Someone
Tyeglev
still
looked
away
A
woman
whom
I
had
hitherto
only
believed
to
be
dead
but
now
I
know
it
for
certain
I
swear
Ilya
Stepanitch
I
cried
this
is
all
your
imagination
Imagination
he
repeated
Would
you
like
to
hear
it
for
yourself
Yes
Then
come
outside
I
hurriedly
dressed
and
went
out
of
the
hut
with
Tyeglev
On
the
side
opposite
to
it
there
were
no
houses
nothing
but
a
low
hurdle
fence
broken
down
in
places
beyond
which
there
was
a
rather
sharp
slope
down
to
the
plain
Everything
was
still
shrouded
in
mist
and
one
could
scarcely
see
anything
twenty
paces
away
Tyeglev
and
I
went
up
to
the
hurdle
and
stood
still
Here
he
said
and
bowed
his
head
Stand
still
keep
quiet
and
listen
Like
him
I
strained
my
ears
and
I
heard
nothing
except
the
ordinary
extremely
faint
but
universal
murmur
the
breathing
of
the
night
Looking
at
each
other
in
silence
from
time
to
time
we
stood
motionless
for
several
minutes
and
were
just
on
the
point
of
going
on
Ilyusha
I
fancied
I
heard
a
whisper
from
behind
the
hurdle
I
glanced
at
Tyeglev
but
he
seemed
to
have
heard
nothing
and
still
held
his
head
bowed
Ilyusha
ah
Ilyusha
sounded
more
distinctly
than
before
so
distinctly
that
one
could
tell
that
the
words
were
uttered
by
a
woman
We
both
started
and
stared
at
each
other
Well
Tyeglev
asked
me
in
a
whisper
You
wo
n't
doubt
it
now
will
you
Wait
a
minute
I
answered
as
quietly
It
proves
nothing
We
must
look
whether
there
is
n't
anyone
Some
practical
joker
I
jumped
over
the
fence
and
went
in
the
direction
from
which
as
far
as
I
could
judge
the
voice
came
I
felt
the
earth
soft
and
crumbling
under
my
feet
long
ridges
stretched
before
me
vanishing
into
the
mist
I
was
in
the
kitchen
garden
But
nothing
was
stirring
around
me
or
before
me
Everything
seemed
spellbound
in
the
numbness
of
sleep
I
went
a
few
steps
further
Who
is
there
I
cried
as
wildly
as
Tyeglev
had
Prrr-r-r
a
startled
corn-crake
flew
up
almost
under
my
feet
and
flew
away
as
straight
as
a
bullet
Involuntarily
I
started
What
foolishness
I
looked
back
Tyeglev
was
in
sight
at
the
spot
where
I
left
him
I
went
towards
him
You
will
call
in
vain
he
said
That
voice
has
come
to
us
to
me
from
far
away
He
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
and
with
slow
steps
crossed
the
road
towards
the
hut
But
I
did
not
want
to
give
in
so
quickly
and
went
back
into
the
kitchen
garden
That
someone
really
had
three
times
called
Ilyusha
I
could
not
doubt
that
there
was
something
plaintive
and
mysterious
in
the
call
I
was
forced
to
own
to
myself
But
who
knows
perhaps
all
this
only
appeared
to
be
unaccountable
and
in
reality
could
be
explained
as
simply
as
the
knocking
which
had
agitated
Tyeglev
so
much
I
walked
along
beside
the
fence
stopping
from
time
to
time
and
looking
about
me
Close
to
the
fence
at
no
great
distance
from
our
hut
there
stood
an
old
leafy
willow
tree
it
stood
out
a
big
dark
patch
against
the
whiteness
of
the
mist
all
round
that
dim
whiteness
which
perplexes
and
deadens
the
sight
more
than
darkness
itself
All
at
once
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
alive
fairly
big
stirred
on
the
ground
near
the
willow
Exclaiming
Stop
Who
is
there
I
rushed
forward
I
heard
scurrying
footsteps
like
a
hare
's
a
crouching
figure
whisked
by
me
whether
man
or
woman
I
could
not
tell
I
tried
to
clutch
at
it
but
did
not
succeed
I
stumbled
fell
down
and
stung
my
face
against
a
nettle
As
I
was
getting
up
leaning
on
the
ground
I
felt
something
rough
under
my
hand
it
was
a
chased
brass
comb
on
a
cord
such
as
peasants
wear
on
their
belt
Further
search
led
to
nothing
and
I
went
back
to
the
hut
with
the
comb
in
my
hand
and
my
cheeks
tingling
I
found
Tyeglev
sitting
on
the
bench
A
candle
was
burning
on
the
table
before
him
and
he
was
writing
something
in
a
little
album
which
he
always
had
with
him
Seeing
me
he
quickly
put
the
album
in
his
pocket
and
began
filling
his
pipe
Look
here
my
friend
I
began
what
a
trophy
I
have
brought
back
from
my
expedition
I
showed
him
the
comb
and
told
him
what
had
happened
to
me
near
the
willow
I
must
have
startled
a
thief
I
added
You
heard
a
horse
was
stolen
from
our
neighbour
yesterday
Tyeglev
smiled
frigidly
and
lighted
his
pipe
I
sat
down
beside
him
And
do
you
still
believe
Ilya
Stepanitch
I
said
that
the
voice
we
heard
came
from
those
unknown
realms
He
stopped
me
with
a
peremptory
gesture
Ridel
he
began
I
am
in
no
mood
for
jesting
and
so
I
beg
you
not
to
jest
He
certainly
was
in
no
mood
for
jesting
His
face
was
changed
It
looked
paler
longer
and
more
expressive
His
strange
different
eyes
kept
shifting
from
one
object
to
another
I
never
thought
he
began
again
that
I
should
reveal
to
another
another
man
what
you
are
about
to
hear
and
what
ought
to
have
died
yes
died
hidden
in
my
breast
but
it
seems
it
is
to
be
and
indeed
I
have
no
choice
It
is
destiny
Listen
And
he
told
me
a
long
story
I
have
mentioned
already
that
he
was
a
poor
hand
at
telling
stories
but
it
was
not
only
his
lack
of
skill
in
describing
events
that
had
happened
to
him
that
impressed
me
that
night
the
very
sound
of
his
voice
his
glances
the
movements
which
he
made
with
his
fingers
and
his
hands
everything
about
him
indeed
seemed
unnatural
unnecessary
false
in
fact
I
was
very
young
and
inexperienced
in
those
days
and
did
not
know
that
the
habit
of
high-flown
language
and
falsity
of
intonation
and
manner
may
become
so
ingrained
in
a
man
that
he
is
incapable
of
shaking
it
off
it
is
a
sort
of
curse
Later
in
life
I
came
across
a
lady
who
described
to
me
the
effect
on
her
of
her
son
's
death
of
her
boundless
grief
of
her
fears
for
her
reason
in
such
exaggerated
language
with
such
theatrical
gestures
such
melodramatic
movements
of
her
head
and
rolling
of
her
eyes
that
I
thought
to
myself
How
false
and
affected
that
lady
is
She
did
not
love
her
son
at
all
And
a
week
afterwards
I
heard
that
the
poor
woman
had
really
gone
out
of
her
mind
Since
then
I
have
become
much
more
careful
in
my
judgments
and
have
had
far
less
confidence
in
my
own
impressions
The
story
which
Tyeglev
told
me
was
briefly
as
follows
He
had
living
in
Petersburg
besides
his
influential
uncle
an
aunt
not
influential
but
wealthy
As
she
had
no
children
of
her
own
she
had
adopted
a
little
girl
an
orphan
of
the
working
class
given
her
a
liberal
education
and
treated
her
like
a
daughter
She
was
called
Masha
Tyeglev
saw
her
almost
every
day
It
ended
in
their
falling
in
love
with
one
another
and
Masha
's
giving
herself
to
him
This
was
discovered
Tyeglev
's
aunt
was
fearfully
incensed
she
