marvel
is
this
he
cried
more
than
once
And
why
did
Emilie
write
to
him
She
had
made
an
appointment
and
not
come
He
took
out
her
letter
turned
it
over
in
his
hands
sniffed
it
it
smelt
of
tobacco
and
in
one
place
he
noticed
a
correction
But
what
could
he
deduce
from
that
And
was
it
possible
that
Madame
Fritsche
knew
nothing
about
it
And
she
Who
was
she
Yes
who
was
she
The
fascinating
Colibri
that
pretty
doll
that
little
image
was
always
before
him
and
he
looked
forward
with
impatience
to
the
following
evening
though
secretly
he
was
almost
afraid
of
this
pretty
doll
and
little
image
Next
day
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
went
shopping
before
dinner
and
after
persistent
haggling
bought
a
tiny
gold
cross
on
a
little
velvet
ribbon
Though
she
declares
he
thought
that
she
never
takes
presents
we
all
know
what
such
sayings
mean
and
if
she
really
is
so
disinterested
Emilie
wo
n't
be
so
squeamish
So
argued
this
Don
Juan
of
Nikolaev
who
had
probably
never
heard
of
the
original
Don
Juan
and
knew
nothing
about
him
At
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
shaved
carefully
and
sending
for
a
hairdresser
he
knew
told
him
to
pomade
and
curl
his
topknot
which
the
latter
did
with
peculiar
zeal
not
sparing
the
government
note
paper
for
curlpapers
then
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
put
on
a
smart
new
uniform
took
into
his
right
hand
a
pair
of
new
wash-leather
gloves
and
sprinkling
himself
with
lavender
water
set
off
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
took
a
great
deal
more
trouble
over
his
personal
appearance
on
this
occasion
than
when
he
went
to
see
his
Zuckerp
ppchen
not
because
he
liked
Colibri
better
than
Emilie
but
in
the
pretty
little
doll
there
was
something
enigmatic
something
which
stirred
even
the
sluggish
imagination
of
the
young
lieutenant
Madame
Fritsche
greeted
him
as
she
had
done
the
day
before
and
as
though
she
had
conspired
with
him
in
a
plan
of
deception
informed
him
again
that
Emilie
had
gone
out
for
a
short
time
and
asked
him
to
wait
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
nodded
in
token
of
assent
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
Madame
Fritsche
smiled
again
that
is
showed
her
yellow
tusks
and
withdrew
without
offering
him
any
chocolate
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
instantly
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
mysterious
door
It
remained
closed
He
coughed
loudly
once
or
twice
so
as
to
make
known
his
presence
The
door
did
not
stir
He
held
his
breath
strained
his
ears
He
heard
not
the
faintest
sound
or
rustle
everything
was
still
as
death
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
got
up
approached
the
door
on
tiptoe
and
fumbling
in
vain
with
his
fingers
pressed
his
knee
against
it
It
was
no
use
Then
he
bent
down
and
once
or
twice
articulated
in
a
loud
whisper
Colibri
Colibri
Little
doll
No
one
responded
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
drew
himself
up
straightened
his
uniform
and
after
standing
still
a
little
while
walked
with
more
resolute
steps
to
the
window
and
began
drumming
on
the
pane
He
began
to
feel
vexed
indignant
his
dignity
as
an
officer
began
to
assert
itself
What
nonsense
is
this
he
thought
at
last
whom
do
they
take
me
for
If
they
go
on
like
this
I
'll
knock
with
my
fists
She
will
be
forced
to
answer
The
old
woman
will
hear
What
of
it
That
's
not
my
fault
He
turned
swiftly
on
his
heel
the
door
stood
half
open
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
immediately
hastened
into
the
secret
room
again
on
tiptoe
Colibri
was
lying
on
the
sofa
in
a
white
dress
with
a
broad
red
sash
Covering
the
lower
part
of
her
face
with
a
handkerchief
she
was
laughing
a
noiseless
but
genuine
laugh
She
had
done
up
her
hair
this
time
plaiting
it
into
two
long
thick
plaits
intertwined
with
red
ribbon
the
same
slippers
adorned
her
tiny
crossed
feet
but
the
feet
themselves
were
bare
and
looking
at
them
one
might
fancy
that
she
had
on
dark
silky
stockings
The
sofa
stood
in
a
different
position
nearer
the
wall
and
on
the
table
he
saw
on
a
Chinese
tray
a
bright-coloured
round-bellied
coffee
pot
beside
a
cut
glass
sugar
bowl
and
two
blue
China
cups
The
guitar
was
lying
there
too
and
blue-grey
smoke
rose
in
a
thin
coil
from
a
big
aromatic
candle
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
went
up
to
the
sofa
and
bent
over
Colibri
but
before
he
had
time
to
utter
a
word
she
held
out
her
hand
and
still
laughing
in
her
handkerchief
put
her
little
rough
fingers
into
his
hair
and
instantly
ruffled
the
well-arranged
curls
on
the
top
of
his
head
What
next
exclaimed
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
not
altogether
pleased
by
such
unceremoniousness
Oh
you
naughty
girl
Colibri
took
the
handkerchief
from
her
face
Not
nice
so
better
now
She
moved
away
to
the
further
end
of
the
sofa
and
drew
her
feet
up
under
her
Sit
down
there
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
sat
down
on
the
spot
indicated
Why
do
you
move
away
he
said
after
a
brief
silence
Surely
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
Colibri
curled
herself
up
and
looked
at
him
sideways
I
am
not
afraid
no
You
must
not
be
shy
with
me
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
said
in
an
admonishing
tone
Do
you
remember
your
promise
yesterday
to
give
me
a
kiss
Colibri
put
her
arms
round
her
knees
laid
her
head
on
them
and
looked
at
him
again
I
remember
I
should
hope
so
And
you
must
keep
your
word
Yes
I
must
In
that
case
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
beginning
and
he
moved
nearer
Colibri
freed
her
plaits
which
she
was
holding
tight
with
her
knees
and
with
one
of
them
gave
him
a
flick
on
his
hand
Not
so
fast
sir
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
embarrassed
What
eyes
she
has
the
rogue
he
muttered
as
though
to
himself
But
he
went
on
raising
his
voice
why
did
you
call
me
if
that
is
how
it
is
Colibri
craned
her
neck
like
a
bird
she
listened
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
alarmed
Emilie
he
asked
No
Someone
else
Colibri
shrugged
her
shoulder
Do
you
hear
something
Nothing
With
a
birdlike
movement
again
Colibri
drew
back
her
little
oval-shaped
head
with
its
pretty
parting
and
the
short
growth
of
tiny
curls
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
where
her
plaits
began
and
again
curled
herself
up
into
a
ball
Nothing
Nothing
Then
now
I
'll
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
craned
forward
towards
Colibri
but
at
once
pulled
back
his
hand
There
was
a
drop
of
blood
on
his
finger
What
foolishness
is
this
he
cried
shaking
his
finger
Your
everlasting
pins
And
the
devil
of
a
pin
it
is
he
added
looking
at
the
long
golden
pin
which
Colibri
slowly
thrust
into
her
sash
It
's
a
regular
dagger
it
's
a
sting
Yes
yes
it's
your
sting
and
you
are
a
wasp
that
's
what
you
are
a
wasp
do
you
hear
Apparently
Colibri
was
much
pleased
at
Kuzma
Vasselyevitch's
comparison
she
went
off
into
a
thin
laugh
and
repeated
several
times
over
Yes
I
will
sting
I
will
sting
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
looked
at
her
and
thought
She
is
laughing
but
her
face
is
melancholy
Look
what
I
am
going
to
show
you
he
said
aloud
Tso
Why
do
you
say
tso
Are
you
a
Pole
Nee
Now
you
say
nee
But
there
it
's
no
matter
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
got
out
his
present
and
waved
it
in
the
air
Look
at
it
Is
n't
it
nice
Colibri
raised
her
eyes
indifferently
Ah
A
cross
We
do
n't
wear
What
You
do
n't
wear
a
cross
Are
you
a
Jewess
then
or
what
We
do
n't
wear
repeated
Colibri
and
suddenly
starting
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
Would
you
like
me
to
sing
she
asked
hurriedly
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
put
the
cross
in
the
pocket
of
his
uniform
and
he
too
looked
round
What
is
it
he
muttered
A
mouse
a
mouse
Colibri
said
hurriedly
and
suddenly
to
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
's
complete
surprise
flung
her
smooth
supple
arms
round
his
neck
and
a
rapid
kiss
burned
his
cheek
as
though
a
red-hot
ember
had
been
pressed
against
it
He
pressed
Colibri
in
his
arms
but
she
slipped
away
like
a
snake
her
waist
was
hardly
thicker
than
the
body
of
a
snake
and
leapt
to
her
feet
Wait
she
whispered
you
must
have
some
coffee
first
Nonsense
Coffee
indeed
Afterwards
No
now
Now
hot
after
cold
She
took
hold
of
the
coffee
pot
by
the
handle
and
lifting
it
high
began
pouring
out
two
cups
The
coffee
fell
in
a
thin
as
it
were
twirling
stream
Colibri
leaned
her
head
on
her
shoulder
and
watched
it
fall
There
put
in
the
sugar
drink
and
I
'll
drink
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
put
a
lump
of
sugar
in
the
cup
and
drank
it
off
at
one
draught
The
coffee
struck
him
as
very
strong
and
bitter
Colibri
looked
at
him
smiling
and
faintly
dilated
her
nostrils
over
the
edge
of
her
cup
She
slowly
put
it
down
on
the
table
Why
do
n't
you
drink
it
asked
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
Not
all
now
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
got
excited
Do
sit
down
beside
me
at
least
In
a
minute
She
bent
her
head
and
still
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
picked
up
the
guitar
Only
I
will
sing
first
Yes
yes
only
sit
down
And
I
will
dance
Shall
I
You
dance
Well
I
should
like
to
see
that
But
ca
n't
that
be
afterwards
No
now
But
I
love
you
very
much
You
love
Mind
now
dance
away
then
you
queer
creature
Colibri
stood
on
the
further
side
of
the
table
and
running
her
fingers
several
times
over
the
strings
of
the
guitar
and
to
the
surprise
of
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
who
was
expecting
a
lively
merry
song
began
singing
a
slow
monotonous
air
accompanying
each
separate
sound
which
seemed
as
though
it
were
wrung
out
of
her
by
force
with
a
rhythmical
swaying
of
her
body
to
right
and
left
She
did
not
smile
and
indeed
knitted
her
brows
her
delicate
high
rounded
eyebrows
between
which
a
dark
blue
mark
probably
burnt
in
with
gunpowder
stood
out
sharply
looking
like
some
letter
of
an
oriental
alphabet
She
almost
closed
her
eyes
but
their
pupils
glimmered
dimly
under
the
drooping
lids
fastened
as
before
on
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
And
he
too
could
not
look
away
from
those
marvellous
menacing
eyes
from
that
dark-skinned
face
that
gradually
began
to
glow
from
the
half-closed
and
motionless
lips
from
the
two
black
snakes
rhythmically
moving
on
both
sides
of
her
graceful
head
Colibri
went
on
swaying
without
moving
from
the
spot
and
only
her
feet
were
working
she
kept
lightly
shifting
them
lifting
first
the
toe
and
then
the
heel
Once
she
rotated
rapidly
and
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
waving
the
guitar
high
in
the
air
Then
the
same
monotonous
movement
accompanied
by
the
same
monotonous
singing
began
again
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
sat
meanwhile
very
quietly
on
the
sofa
and
went
on
looking
at
Colibri
he
felt
something
strange
and
unusual
in
himself
he
was
conscious
of
great
lightness
and
freedom
too
great
lightness
in
fact
he
seemed
as
it
were
unconscious
of
his
body
as
though
he
were
floating
and
at
the
same
time
shudders
ran
down
him
a
sort
of
agreeable
weakness
crept
over
his
legs
and
his
lips
and
eyelids
tingled
with
drowsiness
He
had
no
desire
now
no
thought
of
anything
only
he
was
wonderfully
at
ease
as
though
someone
were
lulling
him
singing
him
to
bye-bye
as
Emilie
had
expressed
it
and
he
whispered
to
himself
little
doll
At
times
the
face
of
the
little
doll
grew
misty
Why
is
that
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
wondered
From
the
smoke
he
reassured
himself
There
is
such
a
blue
smoke
here
And
again
someone
was
lulling
him
and
even
whispering
in
his
ear
something
so
sweet
only
for
some
reason
it
was
always
unfinished
But
then
all
of
a
sudden
in
the
little
doll
's
face
the
eyes
opened
till
they
were
immense
incredibly
big
like
the
arches
of
a
bridge
The
guitar
dropped
and
striking
against
the
floor
clanged
somewhere
at
the
other
end
of
the
earth
Some
very
near
and
dear
friend
of
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch's
embraced
him
firmly
and
tenderly
from
behind
and
set
his
cravat
straight
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
saw
just
before
his
own
face
the
hooked
nose
the
thick
moustache
and
the
piercing
eyes
of
the
stranger
with
the
three
buttons
on
his
cuff
and
although
the
eyes
were
in
the
place
of
the
moustache
and
the
nose
itself
seemed
upside
down
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
but
on
the
contrary
thought
that
this
was
how
it
ought
to
be
he
was
even
on
the
point
of
saying
to
the
nose
Hullo
brother
Grigory
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
preferred
preferred
to
set
off
with
Colibri
to
Constantinople
at
once
for
their
forthcoming
wedding
as
she
was
a
Turk
and
the
Tsar
promoted
him
to
be
an
actual
Turk
And
opportunely
a
little
boat
appeared
he
lifted
his
foot
to
get
into
it
and
though
through
clumsiness
he
stumbled
and
hurt
himself
rather
badly
so
that
for
some
time
he
did
not
know
where
anything
was
yet
he
managed
it
and
getting
into
the
boat
floated
on
the
big
river
which
as
the
River
of
Time
flows
to
Constantinople
in
the
map
on
the
walls
of
the
Nikolaevsky
High
School
With
great
satisfaction
he
floated
down
the
river
and
watched
a
number
of
red
ducks
which
continually
met
him
they
would
not
let
him
come
near
them
however
and
diving
changed
into
round
pink
spots
And
Colibri
was
going
with
him
too
but
to
escape
the
sultry
heat
she
hid
under
the
boat
and
from
time
to
time
knocked
on
the
bottom
of
it
And
here
at
last
was
Constantinople
The
houses
as
houses
should
looked
like
Tyrolese
hats
and
the
Turks
had
all
big
sedate
faces
only
it
did
not
do
to
look
at
them
too
long
they
began
wriggling
making
faces
and
at
last
melted
away
altogether
like
thawing
snow
And
here
was
the
palace
in
which
he
would
live
with
Colibri
And
how
well
everything
was
arranged
in
it
Walls
with
generals
gold
lace
on
it
everywhere
epaulettes
people
blowing
trumpets
in
the
corners
and
one
could
float
into
the
drawing-room
in
the
boat
Of
course
there
was
a
portrait
of
Mahomet
Only
Colibri
kept
running
ahead
through
the
rooms
and
her
plaits
trailed
after
her
on
the
floor
and
she
would
not
turn
round
and
she
kept
growing
smaller
and
smaller
And
now
it
was
not
Colibri
but
a
boy
in
a
jacket
and
he
was
the
boy
's
tutor
and
he
had
to
climb
after
the
boy
into
a
telescope
and
the
telescope
got
narrower
and
narrower
till
at
last
he
could
not
move
neither
backwards
nor
forwards
and
something
fell
on
his
back
there
was
earth
in
his
mouth
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
opened
his
eyes
It
was
daylight
and
everything
was
still
there
was
a
smell
of
vinegar
and
mint
Above
him
and
at
his
sides
there
was
something
white
he
looked
more
intently
it
was
the
canopy
of
a
bed
He
wanted
to
raise
his
head
he
could
not
his
hand
he
could
not
do
that
either
What
was
the
meaning
of
it
He
dropped
his
eyes
A
long
body
lay
stretched
before
him
and
over
it
a
yellow
blanket
with
a
brown
edge
The
body
proved
to
be
his
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
's
He
tried
to
cry
out
no
sound
came
He
tried
again
did
his
very
utmost
there
was
the
sound
of
a
feeble
moan
quavering
under
his
nose
He
heard
heavy
footsteps
and
a
sinewy
hand
parted
the
bed
curtains
A
grey-headed
pensioner
in
a
patched
military
overcoat
stood
gazing
at
him
And
he
gazed
at
the
pensioner
A
big
tin
mug
was
put
to
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
's
lips
He
greedily
drank
some
cold
water
His
tongue
was
loosened
Where
am
I
The
pensioner
glanced
at
him
once
more
went
away
and
came
back
with
another
man
in
a
dark
uniform
Where
am
I
repeated
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
Well
he
will
live
now
said
the
man
in
the
dark
uniform
You
are
in
the
hospital
he
added
aloud
but
you
must
go
to
sleep
It
is
bad
for
you
to
talk
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
began
to
feel
surprised
but
sank
into
forgetfulness
again
Next
morning
the
doctor
appeared
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
came
to
himself
The
doctor
congratulated
him
on
his
recovery
and
ordered
the
bandages
round
his
head
to
be
changed
What
My
head
Why
am
I
You
must
n't
talk
you
must
n't
excite
yourself
the
doctor
interrupted
Lie
still
and
thank
the
Almighty
Where
are
the
compresses
Poplyovkin
But
where
is
the
money
the
government
money
There
He
is
lightheaded
again
Some
more
ice
Poplyovkin
Another
week
passed
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
so
much
better
that
the
doctors
found
it
possible
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
to
him
This
is
what
he
learned
At
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
on
the
16th
of
June
he
had
visited
the
house
of
Madame
Fritsche
for
the
last
time
and
on
the
17th
of
June
at
dinner
time
that
is
nearly
twenty-four
hours
later
a
shepherd
had
found
him
in
a
ravine
near
the
Herson
high
road
a
mile
and
a
half
from
Nikolaev
with
a
broken
head
and
crimson
bruises
on
his
neck
His
uniform
and
waistcoat
had
been
unbuttoned
all
his
pockets
turned
inside
out
his
cap
and
cutlass
were
not
to
be
found
nor
his
leather
money
belt
From
the
trampled
grass
from
the
broad
track
upon
the
grass
and
the
clay
it
could
be
inferred
that
the
luckless
lieutenant
had
been
dragged
to
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
and
only
there
had
been
gashed
on
his
head
not
with
an
axe
but
with
a
sabre
probably
his
own
cutlass
there
were
no
traces
of
blood
on
his
track
from
the
high
road
while
there
was
a
perfect
pool
of
blood
round
his
head
There
could
be
no
doubt
that
his
assailants
had
first
drugged
him
then
tried
to
strangle
him
and
taking
him
out
of
the
town
by
night
had
dragged
him
to
the
ravine
and
there
given
him
the
final
blow
It
was
only
thanks
to
his
truly
iron
constitution
that
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
had
not
died
He
had
returned
to
consciousness
on
July
22nd
that
is
five
weeks
later
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
immediately
informed
the
authorities
of
the
misfortune
that
had
happened
to
him
he
stated
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
verbally
and
in
writing
and
gave
the
address
of
Madame
Fritsche
The
police
raided
the
house
but
they
found
no
one
there
the
birds
had
flown
They
got
hold
of
the
owner
of
the
house
But
they
could
not
get
much
sense
out
of
the
latter
a
very
old
and
deaf
workman
He
lived
in
a
different
part
of
the
town
and
all
he
knew
was
that
four
months
before
he
had
let
his
house
to
a
Jewess
with
a
passport
whose
name
was
Schmul
or
Schmulke
which
he
had
immediately
registered
at
the
police
station
She
had
been
joined
by
another
woman
so
he
stated
who
also
had
a
passport
but
what
was
their
calling
did
not
know
and
whether
they
had
other
people
living
with
them
had
not
heard
and
did
not
know
the
lad
whom
he
used
to
keep
as
porter
or
watchman
in
the
house
had
gone
away
to
Odessa
or
Petersburg
and
the
new
porter
had
only
lately
come
on
the
1st
of
July
Inquiries
were
made
at
the
police
station
and
in
the
neighbourhood
it
appeared
that
Madame
Schmulke
together
with
her
companion
whose
real
name
was
Frederika
Bengel
had
left
Nikolaev
about
the
20th
of
June
but
where
they
had
gone
was
unknown
The
mysterious
man
with
a
gipsy
face
and
three
buttons
on
his
cuff
and
the
dark-skinned
foreign
girl
with
an
immense
mass
of
hair
no
one
had
seen
As
soon
as
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
discharged
from
the
hospital
he
visited
the
house
that
had
been
so
fateful
for
him
In
the
little
room
where
he
had
talked
to
Colibri
and
where
there
was
still
a
smell
of
musk
there
was
a
second
secret
door
the
sofa
had
been
moved
in
front
of
it
on
his
second
visit
and
through
it
no
doubt
the
murderer
had
come
and
seized
him
from
behind
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
lodged
a
formal
complaint
proceedings
were
taken
Several
numbered
reports
and
instructions
were
dispatched
in
various
directions
the
appropriate
acknowledgments
and
replies
followed
in
due
course
There
the
incident
closed
The
suspicious
characters
had
disappeared
completely
and
with
them
the
stolen
government
money
had
vanished
too
one
thousand
nine
hundred
and
seventeen
roubles
and
some
kopecks
in
paper
and
gold
Not
an
inconsiderable
sum
in
those
days
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
paying
back
instalments
for
ten
years
when
fortunately
for
him
an
act
of
clemency
from
the
Throne
cancelled
the
debt
He
was
himself
at
first
firmly
convinced
that
Emilie
his
treacherous
Zuckerp
ppchen
was
to
blame
for
all
his
trouble
and
had
originated
the
plot
He
remembered
how
on
the
last
day
he
had
seen
her
he
had
incautiously
dropped
asleep
on
the
sofa
and
how
when
he
woke
he
had
found
her
on
her
knees
beside
him
and
how
confused
she
had
been
and
how
he
had
found
a
hole
in
his
belt
that
evening
a
hole
evidently
made
by
her
scissors
She
saw
the
money
thought
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
she
told
the
old
hag
and
those
other
two
devils
she
entrapped
me
by
writing
me
that
letter
and
so
they
cleaned
me
out
But
who
could
have
expected
it
of
her
He
pictured
the
pretty
good-natured
face
of
Emilie
her
clear
eyes
Women
women
he
repeated
gnashing
his
teeth
brood
of
crocodiles
But
when
he
had
finally
left
the
hospital
and
gone
home
he
learned
one
circumstance
which
perplexed
and
nonplussed
him
On
the
very
day
when
he
was
brought
half
dead
to
the
town
a
girl
whose
description
corresponded
exactly
to
that
of
Emilie
had
rushed
to
his
lodging
with
tear-stained
face
and
dishevelled
hair
and
inquiring
about
him
from
his
orderly
had
dashed
off
like
mad
to
the
hospital
At
the
hospital
she
had
been
told
that
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
would
certainly
die
and
she
had
at
once
disappeared
wringing
her
hands
with
a
look
of
despair
on
her
face
It
was
evident
that
she
had
not
foreseen
had
not
expected
the
murder
Or
perhaps
she
had
herself
been
deceived
and
had
not
received
her
promised
share
Had
she
been
overwhelmed
by
sudden
remorse
And
yet
she
had
left
Nikolaev
afterwards
with
that
loathsome
old
woman
who
had
certainly
known
all
about
it
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
lost
in
conjecture
and
bored
his
orderly
a
good
deal
by
making
him
continually
describe
over
and
over
again
the
appearance
of
the
girl
and
repeat
her
words
A
year
and
a
half
later
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
received
a
letter
in
German
from
Emilie
alias
Frederika
Bengel
which
he
promptly
had
translated
for
him
and
showed
us
more
than
once
in
later
days
It
was
full
of
mistakes
in
spelling
and
exclamation
marks
the
postmark
on
the
envelope
was
Breslau
Here
is
the
translation
as
correct
as
may
be
of
the
letter
My
precious
unforgettable
and
incomparable
Florestan
Mr
Lieutenant
Yergenhof
How
often
I
felt
impelled
to
write
to
you
And
I
have
always
unfortunately
put
it
off
though
the
thought
that
you
may
regard
me
as
having
had
a
hand
in
that
awful
crime
has
always
been
the
most
appalling
thought
to
me
Oh
dear
Mr
Lieutenant
Believe
me
the
day
when
I
learnt
that
you
were
alive
and
well
was
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
But
I
do
not
mean
to
justify
myself
altogether
I
will
not
tell
a
lie
I
was
the
first
to
discover
your
habit
of
carrying
your
money
round
your
waist
Though
indeed
in
our
part
of
the
world
all
the
butchers
and
meat
salesmen
do
the
same
And
I
was
so
incautious
as
to
let
drop
a
word
about
it
I
even
said
in
joke
that
it
would
n't
be
bad
to
take
a
little
of
your
money
But
the
old
wretch
Mr
Florestan
she
was
not
my
aunt
plotted
with
that
godless
monster
Luigi
and
his
accomplice
I
swear
by
my
mother
's
tomb
I
do
n't
know
to
this
day
who
those
people
were
I
only
know
that
his
name
was
Luigi
and
that
they
both
came
from
Bucharest
and
were
certainly
great
criminals
and
were
hiding
from
the
police
and
had
money
and
precious
things
Luigi
was
a
dreadful
individual
ein
schr
ckliches
Subject
to
kill
a
fellow-man
einen
Mitmenschen
meant
nothing
at
all
to
him
He
spoke
every
language
and
it
was
he
who
that
time
got
our
things
back
from
the
cook
Do
n't
ask
how
He
was
capable
of
anything
he
was
an
awful
man
He
assured
the
old
woman
that
he
would
only
drug
you
a
little
and
then
take
you
out
of
town
and
put
you
down
somewhere
and
would
say
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
but
that
it
was
your
fault
that
you
had
taken
too
much
wine
somewhere
But
even
then
the
wretch
had
it
in
his
mind
that
it
would
be
better
to
kill
you
so
that
there
would
be
no
one
to
tell
the
tale
He
wrote
you
that
letter
signed
with
my
name
and
the
old
woman
got
me
away
by
craft
I
suspected
nothing
and
I
was
awfully
afraid
of
Luigi
He
used
to
say
to
me
'I
'll
cut
your
throat
I
'll
cut
your
throat
like
a
chicken
's
And
he
used
to
twitch
his
moustache
so
horribly
as
he
said
it
And
they
dragged
me
into
a
bad
company
too
I
am
very
much
ashamed
Mr
Lieutenant
And
even
now
I
shed
bitter
tears
at
these
memories
It
seems
to
me
ah
I
was
not
born
for
such
doings
But
there
is
no
help
for
it
and
this
is
how
it
all
happened
Afterwards
I
was
horribly
frightened
and
could
not
help
going
away
for
if
the
police
had
found
us
what
would
have
happened
to
us
then
That
accursed
Luigi
fled
at
once
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
you
were
alive
But
I
soon
parted
from
them
all
and
though
now
I
am
often
without
a
crust
of
bread
my
heart
is
at
peace
You
will
ask
me
perhaps
why
I
came
to
Nikolaev
But
I
can
give
you
no
answer
I
have
sworn
I
will
finish
by
asking
of
you
a
favour
a
very
very
important
one
whenever
you
remember
your
little
friend
Emilie
do
not
think
of
her
as
a
black-hearted
criminal
The
eternal
God
sees
my
heart
I
have
a
bad
morality
Ich
habe
eine
schlechte
moralit
t
and
I
am
feather-headed
but
I
am
not
a
criminal
And
I
shall
always
love
and
remember
you
my
incomparable
Florestan
and
shall
always
wish
you
everything
good
on
this
earthly
globe
auf
diesem
Erdenrund
I
do
n't
know
whether
my
letter
will
reach
you
but
if
it
does
write
me
a
few
lines
that
I
may
see
you
have
received
it
Thereby
you
will
make
very
happy
your
ever-devoted
Emilie

Write
to

Breslau
Silesia
P
S
S
I
have
written
to
you
in
German
I
could
not
express
my
feelings
otherwise
but
you
write
to
me
in
Russian
Well
did
you
answer
her
we
asked
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
I
meant
to
I
meant
to
many
times
But
how
was
I
to
write
I
don't
know
German
and
in
Russian
who
would
have
translated
it
And
so
I
did
not
write
And
always
as
he
finished
his
story
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
sighed
shook
his
head
and
said
that
's
what
it
is
to
be
young
And
if
among
his
audience
was
some
new
person
who
was
hearing
the
famous
story
for
the
first
time
he
would
take
his
hand
lay
it
on
his
skull
and
make
him
feel
the
scar
of
the
wound
It
really
was
a
fearful
wound
and
the
scar
reached
from
one
ear
to
the
other

THE
DOG
But
if
one
admits
the
possibility
of
the
supernatural
the
possibility
of
its
participation
in
real
life
then
allow
me
to
ask
what
becomes
of
common
sense
Anton
Stepanitch
pronounced
and
he
folded
his
arms
over
his
stomach
Anton
Stepanitch
had
the
grade
of
a
civil
councillor
served
in
some
incomprehensible
department
and
speaking
emphatically
and
stiffly
in
a
bass
voice
enjoyed
universal
respect
He
had
not
long
before
in
the
words
of
those
who
envied
him
had
the
Stanislav
stuck
on
to
him
That
's
perfectly
true
observed
Skvorevitch
No
one
will
dispute
that
added
Kinarevitch
I
am
of
the
same
opinion
the
master
of
the
house
Finoplentov
chimed
in
from
the
corner
in
falsetto
Well
I
must
confess
I
can
not
agree
for
something
supernatural
has
happened
to
me
myself
said
a
bald
corpulent
middle-aged
gentleman
of
medium
height
who
had
till
then
sat
silent
behind
the
stove
The
eyes
of
all
in
the
room
turned
to
him
with
curiosity
and
surprise
and
there
was
a
silence
The
man
was
a
Kaluga
landowner
of
small
means
who
had
lately
come
to
Petersburg
He
had
once
served
in
the
Hussars
had
lost
money
at
cards
had
resigned
his
commission
and
had
settled
in
the
country
The
recent
economic
reforms
had
reduced
his
income
and
he
had
come
to
the
capital
to
look
out
for
a
suitable
berth
He
had
no
qualifications
and
no
connections
but
he
confidently
relied
on
the
friendship
of
an
old
comrade
who
had
suddenly
for
no
visible
reason
become
a
person
of
importance
and
whom
he
had
once
helped
in
thrashing
a
card
sharper
Moreover
he
reckoned
on
his
luck
and
it
did
not
fail
him
a
few
days
after
his
arrival
in
town
he
received
the
