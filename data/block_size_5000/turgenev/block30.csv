and
coming
straight
towards
him
We
shout
to
him
'Run
run
run
He
should
have
rushed
to
one
side
but
he
up
and
ran
straight
before
him
He
was
scared
to
be
sure
The
ash-tree
covered
him
with
its
top
branches
But
why
it
fell
so
soon
the
Lord
only
knows
Perhaps
it
was
rotten
at
the
core
'And
so
it
crushed
Maksim
'Yes
sir
'To
death
'No
sir
he
's
still
alive
but
as
good
as
dead
his
arms
and
legs
are
crushed
I
was
running
for
Seliverstitch
for
the
doctor
Ardalion
Mihalitch
told
the
constable
to
gallop
to
the
village
for
Seliverstitch
while
he
himself
pushed
on
at
a
quick
trot
to
the
clearing
I
followed
him
We
found
poor
Maksim
on
the
ground
The
peasants
were
standing
about
him
We
got
off
our
horses
He
hardly
moaned
at
all
from
time
to
time
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
looked
round
as
it
were
in
astonishment
and
bit
his
lips
fast
turning
blue
The
lower
part
of
his
face
was
twitching
his
hair
was
matted
on
his
brow
his
breast
heaved
irregularly
he
was
dying
The
light
shade
of
a
young
lime-tree
glided
softly
over
his
face
We
bent
down
to
him
He
recognised
Ardalion
Mihalitch
'Please
sir
he
said
to
him
hardly
articulately
'send
for
the
priest
tell
the
Lord
has
punished
me
arms
legs
all
smashed
to-day
's
Sunday
and
I
I
see
did
n't
let
the
lads
off
work
He
ceased
out
of
breath
'And
my
money
for
my
wife
after
deducting
Onesim
here
knows
whom
I
what
I
owe
'We
've
sent
for
the
doctor
Maksim
said
my
neighbour
'perhaps
you
may
not
die
yet
He
tried
to
open
his
eyes
and
with
an
effort
raised
the
lids
'No
I
'm
dying
Here
here
it
is
coming
here
it
Forgive
me
lads
if
in
any
way
'God
will
forgive
you
Maksim
Andreitch
said
the
peasants
thickly
with
one
voice
and
they
took
off
their
caps
'do
you
forgive
us
He
suddenly
shook
his
head
despairingly
his
breast
heaved
with
a
painful
effort
and
he
fell
back
again
'We
ca
n't
let
him
lie
here
and
die
though
cried
Ardalion
Mihalitch
'lads
give
us
the
mat
from
the
cart
and
carry
him
to
the
hospital
Two
men
ran
to
the
cart
'I
bought
a
horse
yesterday
faltered
the
dying
man
'off
Efim
Sitchovsky
paid
earnest
money
so
the
horse
is
mine
Give
it
to
my
wife
They
began
to
move
him
on
to
the
mat
He
trembled
all
over
like
a
wounded
bird
and
stiffened
'He
is
dead
muttered
the
peasants
We
mounted
our
horses
in
silence
and
rode
away
The
death
of
poor
Maksim
set
me
musing
How
wonderfully
indeed
the
Russian
peasant
dies
The
temper
in
which
he
meets
his
end
can
not
be
called
indifference
or
stolidity
he
dies
as
though
he
were
performing
a
solemn
rite
coolly
and
simply
A
few
years
ago
a
peasant
belonging
to
another
neighbour
of
mine
in
the
country
got
burnt
in
the
drying
shed
where
the
corn
is
put
He
would
have
remained
there
but
a
passing
pedlar
pulled
him
out
half-dead
he
plunged
into
a
tub
of
water
and
with
a
run
broke
down
the
door
of
the
burning
outhouse
I
went
to
his
hut
to
see
him
It
was
dark
smoky
stifling
in
the
hut
I
asked
'Where
is
the
sick
man
'There
sir
on
the
stove
the
sorrowing
peasant
woman
answered
me
in
a
sing-song
voice
I
went
up
the
peasant
was
lying
covered
with
a
sheepskin
breathing
heavily
'Well
how
do
you
feel
The
injured
man
stirred
on
the
stove
all
over
burns
within
sight
of
death
as
he
was
tried
to
rise
'Lie
still
lie
still
lie
still
Well
how
are
you
'In
a
bad
way
surely
said
he
'Are
you
in
pain
No
answer
'Is
there
anything
you
want
No
answer
'Should
n't
I
send
you
some
tea
or
anything
'There
's
no
need
I
moved
away
from
him
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
I
sat
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
I
sat
there
half
an
hour
the
silence
of
the
tomb
in
the
hut
In
the
corner
behind
the
table
under
the
holy
pictures
crouched
a
little
girl
of
twelve
years
old
eating
a
piece
of
bread
Her
mother
threatened
her
every
now
and
then
In
the
outer
room
there
was
coming
and
going
noise
and
talk
the
brother
's
wife
was
chopping
cabbage
'Hey
Aksinya
said
the
injured
man
at
last
'What
'Some
kvas
'Aksinya
gave
him
some
kvas
Silence
again
I
asked
in
a
whisper
'Have
they
given
him
the
sacrament
'Yes
So
then
everything
was
in
order
he
was
waiting
for
death
that
was
all
I
could
not
bear
it
and
went
away
Again
I
recall
how
I
went
one
day
to
the
hospital
in
the
village
of
Krasnogorye
to
see
the
surgeon
Kapiton
a
friend
of
mine
and
an
enthusiastic
sportsman
This
hospital
consisted
of
what
had
once
been
the
lodge
of
the
manor-house
the
lady
of
the
manor
had
founded
it
herself
in
other
words
she
ordered
a
blue
board
to
be
nailed
up
above
the
door
with
an
inscription
in
white
letters
'Krasnogorye
Hospital
and
had
herself
handed
to
Kapiton
a
red
album
to
record
the
names
of
the
patients
in
On
the
first
page
of
this
album
one
of
the
toadying
parasites
of
this
Lady
Bountiful
had
inscribed
the
following
lines
'Dans
ces
beaux
lieux
o
r
gne
l'all
gresse
Ce
temple
fut
ouvert
par
la
Beaut
De
vos
seigneurs
admirez
la
tendresse
Bons
habitants
de
Krasnogori
while
another
gentleman
had
written
below
'Et
moi
aussi
j'aime
la
nature
JEAN
KOBYLIATNIKOFF
The
surgeon
bought
six
beds
at
his
own
expense
and
had
set
to
work
in
a
thankful
spirit
to
heal
God
's
people
Besides
him
the
staff
consisted
of
two
persons
an
engraver
Pavel
liable
to
attacks
of
insanity
and
a
one-armed
peasant
woman
Melikitrisa
who
performed
the
duties
of
cook
Both
of
them
mixed
the
medicines
and
dried
and
infused
herbs
they
too
controlled
the
patients
when
they
were
delirious
The
insane
engraver
was
sullen
in
appearance
and
sparing
of
words
at
night
he
would
sing
a
song
about
'lovely
Venus
and
would
besiege
every
one
he
met
with
a
request
for
permission
to
marry
a
girl
called
Malanya
who
had
long
been
dead
The
one-armed
peasant
woman
used
to
beat
him
and
set
him
to
look
after
the
turkeys
Well
one
day
I
was
at
Kapiton
's
We
had
begun
talking
over
our
last
day
's
shooting
when
suddenly
a
cart
drove
into
the
yard
drawn
by
an
exceptionally
stout
horse
such
as
are
only
found
belonging
to
millers
In
the
cart
sat
a
thick-set
peasant
in
a
new
greatcoat
with
a
beard
streaked
with
grey
'Hullo
Vassily
Dmitritch
Kapiton
shouted
from
the
window
'please
come
in
The
miller
of
Liobovshin
he
whispered
to
me
The
peasant
climbed
groaning
out
of
the
cart
came
into
the
surgeon
's
room
and
after
looking
for
the
holy
pictures
crossed
himself
bowing
to
them
'Well
Vassily
Dmitritch
any
news
But
you
must
be
ill
you
do
n't
look
well
'Yes
Kapiton
Timofeitch
there
's
something
not
right
'What
's
wrong
with
you
'Well
it
was
like
this
Kapiton
Timofeitch
Not
long
ago
I
bought
some
mill-stones
in
the
town
so
I
took
them
home
and
as
I
went
to
lift
them
out
of
the
cart
I
strained
myself
or
something
I
'd
a
sort
of
rick
in
the
loins
as
though
something
had
been
torn
away
and
ever
since
I've
been
out
of
sorts
To-day
I
feel
worse
than
ever
'Hm
commented
Kapiton
and
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
'that
's
a
rupture
no
doubt
But
is
it
long
since
this
happened
'It
's
ten
days
now
'Ten
days
The
surgeon
drew
a
long
inward
breath
and
shook
his
head
'Let
me
examine
you
'Well
Vassily
Dmitritch
he
pronounced
at
last
'I
am
sorry
for
you
heartily
sorry
but
things
are
n't
right
with
you
at
all
you're
seriously
ill
stay
here
with
me
I
will
do
everything
I
can
for
my
part
though
I
ca
n't
answer
for
anything
'So
bad
as
that
muttered
the
astounded
peasant
'Yes
Vassily
Dmitritch
it
is
bad
if
you
'd
come
to
me
a
day
or
two
sooner
it
would
have
been
nothing
much
I
could
have
cured
you
in
a
trice
but
now
inflammation
has
set
in
before
we
know
where
we
are
there
'll
be
mortification
'But
it
ca
n't
be
Kapiton
Timofeitch
'I
tell
you
it
is
so
'But
how
comes
it
The
surgeon
shrugged
his
shoulders
'And
I
must
die
for
a
trifle
like
that
'I
do
n't
say
that
only
you
must
stop
here
The
peasant
pondered
and
pondered
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
then
he
glanced
up
at
us
scratched
his
head
and
picked
up
his
cap
'Where
are
you
off
to
Vassily
Dmitritch
'Where
why
home
to
be
sure
if
it
's
so
bad
I
must
put
things
to
rights
if
it
's
like
that
'But
you
'll
do
yourself
harm
Vassily
Dmitritch
you
will
really
I
'm
surprised
how
you
managed
to
get
here
you
must
stop
'No
brother
Kapiton
Timofeitch
if
I
must
die
I
'll
die
at
home
why
die
here
I
've
got
a
home
and
the
Lord
knows
how
it
will
end
'No
one
can
tell
yet
Vassily
Dmitritch
how
it
will
end
Of
course
there
is
danger
considerable
danger
there
's
no
disputing
that
but
for
that
reason
you
ought
to
stay
here
The
peasant
shook
his
head
'No
Kapiton
Timofeitch
I
wo
n't
stay
but
perhaps
you
will
prescribe
me
a
medicine
'Medicine
alone
will
be
no
good
'I
wo
n't
stay
I
tell
you
'Well
as
you
like
Mind
you
don't
blame
me
for
it
afterwards
The
surgeon
tore
a
page
out
of
the
album
and
writing
out
a
prescription
gave
him
some
advice
as
to
what
he
could
do
besides
The
peasant
took
the
sheet
of
paper
gave
Kapiton
half-a-rouble
went
out
of
the
room
and
took
his
seat
in
the
cart
'Well
good-bye
Kapiton
Timofeitch
do
n't
remember
evil
against
me
and
remember
my
orphans
if
anything
'Oh
do
stay
Vassily
The
peasant
simply
shook
his
head
struck
the
horse
with
the
reins
and
drove
out
of
the
yard
The
road
was
muddy
and
full
of
holes
the
miller
drove
cautiously
without
hurry
guiding
his
horse
skilfully
and
nodding
to
the
acquaintances
he
met
Three
days
later
he
was
dead
The
Russians
in
general
meet
death
in
a
marvellous
way
Many
of
the
dead
come
back
now
to
my
memory
I
recall
you
my
old
friend
who
left
the
university
with
no
degree
Avenir
Sorokoumov
noblest
best
of
men
I
see
once
again
your
sickly
consumptive
face
your
lank
brown
tresses
your
gentle
smile
your
ecstatic
glance
your
long
limbs
I
can
hear
your
weak
caressing
voice
You
lived
at
a
Great
Russian
landowner
's
called
Gur
Krupyanikov
taught
his
children
Fofa
and
Zyozya
Russian
grammar
geography
and
history
patiently
bore
all
the
ponderous
jokes
of
the
said
Gur
the
coarse
familiarities
of
the
steward
the
vulgar
pranks
of
the
spiteful
urchins
with
a
bitter
smile
but
without
repining
you
complied
with
the
caprices
of
their
bored
and
exacting
mother
but
to
make
up
for
it
all
what
bliss
what
peace
was
yours
in
the
evening
after
supper
when
free
at
last
of
all
duties
you
sat
at
the
window
pensively
smoking
a
pipe
or
greedily
turned
the
pages
of
a
greasy
and
mutilated
number
of
some
solid
magazine
brought
you
from
the
town
by
the
land-surveyor
just
such
another
poor
homeless
devil
as
yourself
How
delighted
you
were
then
with
any
sort
of
poem
or
novel
how
readily
the
tears
started
into
your
eyes
with
what
pleasure
you
laughed
what
genuine
love
for
others
what
generous
sympathy
for
everything
good
and
noble
filled
your
pure
youthful
soul
One
must
tell
the
truth
you
were
not
distinguished
by
excessive
sharpness
of
wit
Nature
had
endowed
you
with
neither
memory
nor
industry
at
the
university
you
were
regarded
as
one
of
the
least
promising
students
at
lectures
you
slumbered
at
examinations
you
preserved
a
solemn
silence
but
who
was
beaming
with
delight
and
breathless
with
excitement
at
a
friend
's
success
a
friend
's
triumphs
Avenir
Who
had
a
blind
faith
in
the
lofty
destiny
of
his
friends
who
extolled
them
with
pride
who
championed
them
with
angry
vehemence
who
was
innocent
of
envy
as
of
vanity
who
was
ready
for
the
most
disinterested
self-sacrifice
who
eagerly
gave
way
to
men
who
were
not
worthy
to
untie
his
latchet
That
was
you
all
you
our
good
Avenir
I
remember
how
broken-heartedly
you
parted
from
your
comrades
when
you
were
going
away
to
be
a
tutor
in
the
country
you
were
haunted
by
presentiment
of
evil
And
indeed
your
lot
was
a
sad
one
in
the
country
you
had
no
one
there
to
listen
to
with
veneration
no
one
to
admire
no
one
to
love
The
neighbours
rude
sons
of
the
steppes
and
polished
gentlemen
alike
treated
you
as
a
tutor
some
with
rudeness
and
neglect
others
carelessly
Besides
you
were
not
pre-possessing
in
person
you
were
shy
given
to
blushing
getting
hot
and
stammering
Even
your
health
was
no
better
for
the
country
air
you
wasted
like
a
candle
poor
fellow
It
is
true
your
room
looked
out
into
the
garden
wild
cherries
apple-trees
and
limes
strewed
their
delicate
blossoms
on
your
table
your
ink-stand
your
books
on
the
wall
hung
a
blue
silk
watch-pocket
a
parting
present
from
a
kind-hearted
sentimental
German
governess
with
flaxen
curls
and
little
blue
eyes
and
sometimes
an
old
friend
from
Moscow
would
come
out
to
you
and
throw
you
into
ecstasies
with
new
poetry
often
even
with
his
own
But
oh
the
loneliness
the
insufferable
slavery
of
a
tutor
's
lot
the
impossibility
of
escape
the
endless
autumns
and
winters
the
ever-advancing
disease
Poor
poor
Avenir
I
paid
Sorokoumov
a
visit
not
long
before
his
death
He
was
then
hardly
able
to
walk
The
landowner
Gur
Krupyanikov
had
not
turned
him
out
of
the
house
but
had
given
up
paying
him
a
salary
and
had
taken
another
tutor
for
Zyozya
Fofa
had
been
sent
to
a
school
of
cadets
Avenir
was
sitting
near
the
window
in
an
old
easy-chair
It
was
exquisite
weather
The
clear
autumn
sky
was
a
bright
blue
above
the
dark-brown
line
of
bare
limes
here
and
there
a
few
last
leaves
of
lurid
gold
rustled
and
whispered
about
them
The
earth
had
been
covered
with
frost
now
melting
into
dewdrops
in
the
sun
whose
ruddy
rays
fell
aslant
across
the
pale
grass
there
was
a
faint
crisp
resonance
in
the
air
the
voices
of
the
labourers
in
the
garden
reached
us
clearly
and
distinctly
Avenir
wore
an
old
Bokhara
dressing-gown
a
green
neckerchief
threw
a
deathly
hue
over
his
terribly
sunken
face
He
was
greatly
delighted
to
see
me
held
out
his
hand
began
talking
and
coughing
at
once
I
made
him
be
quiet
and
sat
down
by
him
On
Avenir
's
knee
lay
a
manuscript
book
of
Koltsov
's
poems
carefully
copied
out
he
patted
it
with
a
smile
'That
's
a
poet
he
stammered
with
an
effort
repressing
his
cough
and
he
fell
to
declaiming
in
a
voice
scarcely
audible
'Can
the
eagle
's
wings
Be
chained
and
fettered
Can
the
pathways
of
heaven
Be
closed
against
him
I
stopped
him
the
doctor
had
forbidden
him
to
talk
I
knew
what
would
please
him
Sorokoumov
never
as
they
say
'kept
up
with
the
science
of
the
day
but
he
was
always
anxious
to
know
what
results
the
leading
intellects
had
reached
Sometimes
he
would
get
an
old
friend
into
a
corner
and
begin
questioning
him
he
would
listen
and
wonder
take
every
word
on
trust
and
even
repeat
it
all
after
him
He
took
a
special
interest
in
German
philosophy
I
began
discoursing
to
him
about
Hegel
this
all
happened
long
ago
as
you
may
gather
Avenir
nodded
his
head
approvingly
raised
his
eyebrows
smiled
and
whispered
'I
see
I
see
ah
that
's
splendid
splendid
The
childish
curiosity
of
this
poor
dying
homeless
outcast
moved
me
I
confess
to
tears
It
must
be
noted
that
Avenir
unlike
the
general
run
of
consumptives
did
not
deceive
himself
in
regard
to
his
disease
But
what
of
that
he
did
not
sigh
nor
grieve
he
did
not
even
once
refer
to
his
position
Rallying
his
strength
he
began
talking
of
Moscow
of
old
friends
of
Pushkin
of
the
drama
of
Russian
literature
he
recalled
our
little
suppers
the
heated
debates
of
our
circle
with
regret
he
uttered
the
names
of
two
or
three
friends
who
were
dead
'Do
you
remember
Dasha
he
went
on
'Ah
there
was
a
heart
of
pure
gold
What
a
heart
and
how
she
loved
me
What
has
become
of
her
now
Wasted
and
fallen
away
poor
dear
I
daresay
I
had
not
the
courage
to
disillusion
the
sick
man
and
indeed
why
should
he
know
that
his
Dasha
was
now
broader
than
she
was
long
and
that
she
was
living
under
the
protection
of
some
merchants
the
brothers
Kondatchkov
that
she
used
powder
and
paint
and
was
for
ever
swearing
and
scolding
'But
ca
n't
we
I
thought
looking
at
his
wasted
face
'get
him
away
from
here
Perhaps
there
may
still
be
a
chance
of
curing
him
But
Avenir
cut
short
my
suggestion
'No
brother
thanks
he
said
'it
makes
no
difference
where
one
dies
I
sha
n't
live
till
the
winter
you
see
Why
give
trouble
for
nothing
I
'm
used
to
this
house
It
's
true
the
people
'They
're
unkind
eh
I
put
in
'No
not
unkind
but
wooden-headed
creatures
However
I
ca
n't
complain
of
them
There
are
neighbours
there
's
a
Mr
Kasatkin
's
daughter
a
cultivated
kind
charming
girl
not
proud
Sorokoumov
began
coughing
again
'I
should
n't
mind
anything
he
went
on
after
taking
breath
'if
they'd
only
let
me
smoke
my
pipe
But
I
'll
have
my
pipe
if
I
die
for
it
he
added
with
a
sly
wink
'Thank
God
I
have
had
life
enough
I
have
known
so
many
fine
people
'But
you
should
at
least
write
to
your
relations
I
interrupted
'Why
write
to
them
They
ca
n't
be
any
help
when
I
die
they
'll
hear
of
it
But
why
talk
about
it
I
'd
rather
you
'd
tell
me
what
you
saw
abroad
I
began
to
tell
him
my
experiences
He
seemed
positively
to
gloat
over
my
story
Towards
evening
I
left
and
ten
days
later
I
received
the
following
letter
from
Mr
Krupyanikov
'I
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
my
dear
sir
that
your
friend
the
student
living
in
my
house
Mr
Avenir
Sorokoumov
died
at
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
three
days
ago
and
was
buried
to-day
at
my
expense
in
the
parish
church
He
asked
me
to
forward
you
the
books
and
manuscripts
enclosed
herewith
He
was
found
to
have
twenty-two
roubles
and
a
half
which
with
the
rest
of
his
belongings
pass
into
the
possession
of
his
relatives
Your
friend
died
fully
conscious
and
I
may
say
with
so
little
sensibility
that
he
showed
no
signs
of
regret
even
when
the
whole
family
of
us
took
a
last
farewell
of
him
My
wife
Kleopatra
Aleksandrovna
sends
you
her
regards
The
death
of
your
friend
has
of
course
affected
her
nerves
as
regards
myself
I
am
thank
God
in
good
health
and
have
the
honour
to
remain
your
humble
servant
'G
KRUPYANIKOV
Many
more
examples
recur
to
me
but
one
can
not
relate
everything
I
will
confine
myself
to
one
I
was
present
at
an
old
lady
's
death-bed
the
priest
had
begun
reading
the
prayers
for
the
dying
over
her
but
suddenly
noticing
that
the
patient
seemed
to
be
actually
dying
he
made
haste
to
give
her
the
cross
to
kiss
The
lady
turned
away
with
an
air
of
displeasure
'You
're
in
too
great
a
hurry
father
she
said
in
a
voice
almost
inarticulate
'in
too
great
a
hurry
She
kissed
the
cross
put
her
hand
under
the
pillow
and
expired
Under
the
pillow
was
a
silver
rouble
she
had
meant
to
pay
the
priest
for
the
service
at
her
own
death
Yes
the
Russians
die
in
a
wonderful
way
THE
SINGERS
The
small
village
of
Kolotovka
once
belonged
to
a
lady
known
in
the
neighbourhood
by
the
nickname
of
Skin-flint
in
illusion
to
her
keen
business
habits
her
real
name
is
lost
in
oblivion
but
has
of
late
years
been
the
property
of
a
German
from
Petersburg
The
village
lies
on
the
slope
of
a
barren
hill
which
is
cut
in
half
from
top
to
bottom
by
a
tremendous
ravine
It
is
a
yawning
chasm
with
shelving
sides
hollowed
out
by
the
action
of
rain
and
snow
and
it
winds
along
the
very
centre
of
the
village
street
it
separates
the
two
sides
of
the
unlucky
hamlet
far
more
than
a
river
would
do
for
a
river
could
at
least
be
crossed
by
a
bridge
A
few
gaunt
willows
creep
timorously
down
its
sandy
sides
at
the
very
bottom
which
is
dry
and
yellow
as
copper
lie
huge
slabs
of
argillaceous
rock
A
cheerless
position
there
's
no
denying
yet
all
the
surrounding
inhabitants
know
the
road
to
Kolotovka
well
they
go
there
often
and
are
always
glad
to
go
At
the
very
summit
of
the
ravine
a
few
paces
from
the
point
where
it
starts
as
a
narrow
fissure
in
the
earth
there
stands
a
small
square
hut
It
stands
alone
apart
from
all
the
others
It
is
thatched
and
has
a
chimney
one
window
keeps
watch
like
a
sharp
eye
over
the
ravine
and
on
winter
evenings
when
it
is
lighted
from
within
it
is
seen
far
away
in
the
dim
frosty
fog
and
its
twinkling
light
is
the
guiding
star
of
many
a
peasant
on
his
road
A
blue
board
is
nailed
up
above
the
door
this
hut
is
a
tavern
called
the
'Welcome
Resort
Spirits
are
sold
here
probably
no
cheaper
than
the
usual
price
but
it
is
far
more
frequented
than
any
other
establishment
of
the
same
sort
in
the
neighbourhood
The
explanation
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
tavern-keeper
Nikolai
Ivanitch
Nikolai
Ivanitch
once
a
slender
curly-headed
and
rosy-cheeked
young
fellow
now
an
excessively
stout
grizzled
man
with
a
fat
face
sly
and
good-natured
little
eyes
and
a
shiny
forehead
with
wrinkles
like
lines
drawn
all
over
it
has
lived
for
more
than
twenty
years
in
Kolotovka
Nikolai
Ivanitch
is
a
shrewd
acute
fellow
like
the
majority
of
tavern-keepers
Though
he
makes
no
conspicuous
effort
to
please
or
to
talk
to
people
he
has
the
art
of
attracting
and
keeping
customers
who
find
it
particularly
pleasant
to
sit
at
his
bar
under
the
placid
and
genial
though
alert
eye
of
the
phlegmatic
host
He
has
a
great
deal
of
common
sense
he
thoroughly
understands
the
landowner
's
conditions
of
life
the
peasant
's
and
the
tradesman
's
He
could
give
sensible
advice
on
difficult
points
but
like
a
cautious
man
and
an
egoist
prefers
to
stand
aloof
and
at
most
and
that
only
in
the
case
of
his
favourite
customers
by
remote
hints
dropped
as
it
were
unintentionally
to
lead
them
into
the
true
way
He
is
an
authority
on
everything
that
is
of
interest
or
importance
to
a
Russian
on
horses
and
cattle
on
timber
bricks
and
crockery
on
woollen
stuffs
and
on
leather
on
songs
and
dances
When
he
has
no
customers
he
is
usually
sitting
like
a
sack
on
the
ground
before
the
door
of
his
hut
his
thin
legs
tucked
under
him
exchanging
a
friendly
greeting
with
every
passer-by
He
has
seen
a
great
deal
in
his
time
many
a
score
of
petty
landowners
who
used
to
come
to
him
for
spirits
he
has
seen
pass
away
before
him
he
knows
everything
that
is
done
for
eighty
miles
round
and
never
gossips
never
gives
a
sign
of
knowing
what
is
unsuspected
by
the
most
keen-sighted
police-officer
He
keeps
his
own
counsel
laughs
and
makes
his
glasses
ring
His
neighbours
respect
him
the
civilian
general
Shtcherpetenko
the
landowner
highest
in
rank
in
the
district
gives
him
a
condescending
nod
whenever
he
drives
past
his
little
house
Nikolai
Ivanitch
is
a
man
of
influence
he
made
a
notorious
horse-stealer
return
a
horse
he
had
taken
from
the
stable
of
one
of
his
friends
he
brought
the
peasants
of
a
neighbouring
village
to
their
senses
when
they
refused
to
accept
a
new
overseer
and
so
on
It
must
not
be
imagined
though
that
he
does
this
from
love
of
justice
from
devotion
to
his
neighbour
no
he
simply
tries
to
prevent
anything
that
might
in
any
way
interfere
with
his
ease
and
comfort
Nikolai
Ivanitch
is
married
and
has
children
His
wife
a
smart
sharp-nosed
and
keen-eyed
woman
of
the
tradesman
class
has
grown
somewhat
stout
of
late
years
like
her
husband
He
relies
on
her
in
everything
and
she
keeps
the
key
of
the
cash-box
Drunken
brawlers
are
afraid
of
her
she
does
not
like
them
they
bring
little
profit
and
make
a
great
deal
of
noise
those
who
are
taciturn
and
surly
in
their
cups
are
more
to
her
taste
Nikolai
Ivanitch
's
children
are
still
small
the
first
four
all
died
but
those
that
are
left
take
after
their
parents
it
is
a
pleasure
to
look
at
their
intelligent
healthy
little
faces
It
was
an
insufferably
hot
day
in
July
when
slowly
dragging
my
feet
along
I
went
up
alongside
the
Kolotovka
ravine
with
my
dog
towards
the
Welcome
Resort
The
sun
blazed
as
it
were
fiercely
in
the
sky
baking
the
parched
earth
relentlessly
the
air
was
thick
with
stifling
dust
Glossy
crows
and
ravens
with
gaping
beaks
looked
plaintively
at
the
passers-by
as
though
asking
for
sympathy
only
the
sparrows
did
not
droop
but
pluming
their
feathers
twittered
more
vigorously
than
ever
as
they
quarrelled
among
the
hedges
or
flew
up
all
together
from
the
dusty
road
and
hovered
in
grey
clouds
over
the
green
hempfields
I
was
tormented
by
thirst
There
was
no
water
near
in
Kolotovka
as
in
many
other
villages
of
the
steppes
the
peasants
having
no
spring
or
well
drink
a
sort
of
thin
mud
out
of
the
pond
For
no
one
could
call
that
repulsive
beverage
water
I
wanted
to
ask
for
a
glass
of
beer
or
kvas
at
Nikolai
Ivanitch
's
It
must
be
confessed
that
at
no
time
of
the
year
does
Kolotovka
present
a
very
cheering
spectacle
but
it
has
a
particularly
depressing
effect
when
the
relentless
rays
of
a
dazzling
July
sun
pour
down
full
upon
the
brown
tumble-down
roofs
of
the
houses
and
the
deep
ravine
and
the
parched
dusty
common
over
which
the
thin
long-legged
hens
are
straying
hopelessly
and
the
remains
of
the
old
manor-house
now
a
hollow
grey
framework
of
aspenwood
with
holes
instead
of
windows
overgrown
with
nettles
wormwood
and
rank
grass
and
the
pond
black
as
though
charred
and
covered
with
goose
feathers
with
its
edge
of
half-dried
mud
and
its
broken-down
dyke
near
which
on
the
finely
trodden
ash-like
earth
sheep
breathless
and
gasping
with
the
heat
huddle
dejectedly
together
their
heads
drooping
with
weary
patience
as
though
waiting
for
this
insufferable
heat
to
pass
at
last
With
weary
steps
I
drew
near
Nikolai
Ivanitch
's
dwelling
arousing
in
the
village
children
the
usual
wonder
manifested
in
a
concentrated
meaningless
stare
and
in
the
dogs
an
indignation
expressed
in
such
hoarse
and
furious
barking
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
tearing
their
very
entrails
and
left
them
breathless
and
choking
when
suddenly
in
the
tavern
doorway
there
appeared
a
tall
peasant
without
a
cap
in
a
frieze
cloak
girt
about
below
his
waist
with
a
blue
handkerchief
He
looked
like
a
house-serf
thick
grey
hair
stood
up
in
disorder
above
his
withered
and
wrinkled
face
He
was
calling
to
some
one
hurriedly
waving
his
arms
which
obviously
were
not
quite
under
his
control
It
could
be
seen
that
he
had
been
drinking
already
'Come
come
along
he
stammered
raising
his
shaggy
eyebrows
with
an
effort
'Come
Blinkard
come
along
Ah
brother
how
you
creep
along
'pon
my
word
It
's
too
bad
brother
They
're
waiting
for
you
within
and
here
you
crawl
along
Come
'Well
I
'm
coming
I
'm
coming
called
a
jarring
voice
and
from
behind
a
hut
a
little
short
fat
lame
man
came
into
sight
He
wore
a
rather
tidy
cloth
coat
pulled
half
on
and
a
high
pointed
cap
right
over
his
brows
which
gave
his
round
plump
face
a
sly
and
comic
expression
His
little
yellow
eyes
moved
restlessly
about
his
thin
lips
wore
a
continual
forced
smile
while
his
sharp
long
nose
peered
forward
saucily
in
front
like
a
rudder
'I
'm
coming
my
dear
fellow
He
went
hobbling
towards
the
tavern
'What
are
you
calling
me
for
Who's
waiting
for
me
'What
am
I
calling
you
for
repeated
the
man
in
the
frieze
coat
reproachfully
You
're
a
queer
fish
Blinkard
we
call
you
to
come
to
the
tavern
and
you
ask
what
for
Here
are
honest
folks
all
waiting
for
you
Yashka
the
Turk
and
the
Wild
Master
and
the
booth-keeper
from
Zhizdry
Yashka
's
got
a
bet
on
with
the
booth-keeper
the
stake
's
a
pot
of
beer
for
the
one
that
does
best
sings
the
best
I
mean
do
you
see
'Is
Yashka
going
to
sing
said
the
man
addressed
as
Blinkard
with
lively
interest
'But
is
n't
it
your
humbug
Gabbler
'I
'm
not
humbugging
answered
the
Gabbler
with
dignity
'it
's
you
are
crazy
I
should
think
he
would
sing
since
he
