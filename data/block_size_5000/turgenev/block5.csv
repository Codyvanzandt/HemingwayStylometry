and
looking
round
the
yard
said
mournfully
Possess
it
all
so
be
it
forever
Good-bye
And
he
went
slowly
out
into
the
road
accompanied
by
Yefrem
Naum
ordered
the
horse
to
be
unharnessed
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
went
back
into
the
house
Where
are
you
off
to
Akim
Semyonitch
Are
n't
you
coming
back
to
me
cried
Yefrem
seeing
that
Akim
was
hurrying
to
the
right
out
of
the
high
road
No
Yefremushka
thank
you
answered
Akim
I
am
going
to
see
what
my
wife
is
doing
You
can
see
afterwards
But
now
we
ought
to
celebrate
the
occasion
No
thank
you
Yefrem
I
've
had
enough
Good-bye
And
Akim
walked
off
without
looking
round
Well
'I
've
had
enough
the
puzzled
sacristan
pronounced
And
I
pledged
my
word
for
him
Well
I
never
expected
this
he
added
with
vexation
after
I
had
pledged
my
word
for
him
too
He
remembered
that
he
had
not
thought
to
take
his
knife
and
his
pot
and
went
back
to
the
inn
Naum
ordered
his
things
to
be
given
to
him
but
never
even
thought
of
offering
him
a
drink
He
returned
home
thoroughly
annoyed
and
thoroughly
sober
Well
his
wife
inquired
found
Found
what
answered
Yefrem
to
be
sure
I
've
found
it
here
is
your
pot
Akim
asked
his
wife
with
especial
emphasis
Yefrem
nodded
his
head
Yes
But
he
is
a
nice
one
I
pledged
my
word
for
him
if
it
had
not
been
for
me
he
'd
be
lying
in
prison
and
he
never
offered
me
a
drop
Ulyana
Fyodorovna
you
at
least
might
show
me
consideration
and
give
me
a
glass
But
Ulyana
Fyodorovna
did
not
show
him
consideration
and
drove
him
out
of
her
sight
Meanwhile
Akim
was
walking
with
slow
steps
along
the
road
to
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
's
house
He
could
not
yet
fully
grasp
his
position
he
was
trembling
all
over
like
a
man
who
had
just
escaped
from
a
certain
death
He
seemed
unable
to
believe
in
his
freedom
In
dull
bewilderment
he
gazed
at
the
fields
at
the
sky
at
the
larks
quivering
in
the
warm
air
From
the
time
he
had
woken
up
on
the
previous
morning
at
Yefrem
's
he
had
not
slept
though
he
had
lain
on
the
stove
without
moving
at
first
he
had
wanted
to
drown
in
vodka
the
insufferable
pain
of
humiliation
the
misery
of
frenzied
and
impotent
anger
but
the
vodka
had
not
been
able
to
stupefy
him
completely
his
anger
became
overpowering
and
he
began
to
think
how
to
punish
the
man
who
had
wronged
him
He
thought
of
no
one
but
Naum
the
idea
of
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
never
entered
his
head
and
on
Avdotya
he
mentally
turned
his
back
By
the
evening
his
thirst
for
revenge
had
grown
to
a
frenzy
and
the
good-natured
and
weak
man
waited
with
feverish
impatience
for
the
approach
of
night
and
ran
like
a
wolf
to
its
prey
to
destroy
his
old
home
But
then
he
had
been
caught
locked
up
The
night
had
followed
What
had
he
not
thought
over
during
that
cruel
night
It
is
difficult
to
put
into
words
all
that
a
man
passes
through
at
such
moments
all
the
tortures
that
he
endures
more
difficult
because
those
tortures
are
dumb
and
inarticulate
in
the
man
himself
Towards
morning
before
Naum
and
Yefrem
had
come
to
the
door
Akim
had
begun
to
feel
as
it
were
more
at
ease
Everything
is
lost
he
thought
everything
is
scattered
and
gone
and
he
dismissed
it
all
If
he
had
been
naturally
bad-hearted
he
might
at
that
moment
have
become
a
criminal
but
evil
was
not
natural
to
Akim
Under
the
shock
of
undeserved
and
unexpected
misfortune
in
the
delirium
of
despair
he
had
brought
himself
to
crime
it
had
shaken
him
to
the
depths
of
his
being
and
failing
had
left
in
him
nothing
but
intense
weariness
Feeling
his
guilt
in
his
mind
he
mentally
tore
himself
from
all
things
earthly
and
began
praying
bitterly
but
fervently
At
first
he
prayed
in
a
whisper
then
perhaps
by
accident
he
uttered
a
loud
Oh
God
and
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
For
a
long
time
he
wept
and
at
last
grew
quieter
His
thoughts
would
probably
have
changed
if
he
had
had
to
pay
the
penalty
of
his
attempted
crime
but
now
he
had
suddenly
been
set
free
and
he
was
walking
to
see
his
wife
feeling
only
half
alive
utterly
crushed
but
calm
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
's
house
stood
about
a
mile
from
her
village
to
the
left
of
the
cross
road
along
which
Akim
was
walking
He
was
about
to
stop
at
the
turning
that
led
to
his
mistress
's
house
but
he
walked
on
instead
He
decided
first
to
go
to
what
had
been
his
hut
where
his
uncle
lived
Akim
's
small
and
somewhat
dilapidated
hut
was
almost
at
the
end
of
the
village
Akin
walked
through
the
whole
street
without
meeting
a
soul
All
the
people
were
at
church
Only
one
sick
old
woman
raised
a
little
window
to
look
after
him
and
a
little
girl
who
had
run
out
with
an
empty
pail
to
the
well
gaped
at
him
and
she
too
looked
after
him
The
first
person
he
met
was
the
uncle
he
was
looking
for
The
old
man
had
been
sitting
all
the
morning
on
the
ledge
under
his
window
taking
pinches
of
snuff
and
warming
himself
in
the
sun
he
was
not
very
well
so
he
had
not
gone
to
church
he
was
just
setting
off
to
visit
another
old
man
a
neighbour
who
was
also
ailing
when
he
suddenly
saw
Akim
He
stopped
let
him
come
up
to
him
and
glancing
into
his
face
said
Good-day
Akimushka
Good-day
answered
Akim
and
passing
the
old
man
went
in
at
the
gate
In
the
yard
were
standing
his
horses
his
cow
his
cart
his
poultry
too
were
there
He
went
into
the
hut
without
a
word
The
old
man
followed
him
Akim
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
leaned
his
fists
on
it
The
old
man
standing
at
the
door
looked
at
him
compassionately
And
where
is
my
wife
asked
Akim
At
the
mistress
's
house
the
old
man
answered
quickly
She
is
there
They
put
your
cattle
here
and
what
boxes
there
were
and
she
has
gone
there
Shall
I
go
for
her
Akim
was
silent
for
a
time
Yes
do
he
said
at
last
Oh
uncle
uncle
he
brought
out
with
a
sigh
while
the
old
man
was
taking
his
hat
from
a
nail
do
you
remember
what
you
said
to
me
the
day
before
my
wedding
It
's
all
God
's
will
Akimushka
Do
you
remember
you
said
to
me
that
I
was
above
you
peasants
and
now
you
see
what
times
have
come
I
'm
stripped
bare
myself
There
's
no
guarding
oneself
from
evil
folk
answered
the
old
man
if
only
someone
such
as
a
master
for
instance
or
someone
in
authority
could
give
him
a
good
lesson
the
shameless
fellow
but
as
it
is
he
has
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
He
is
a
wolf
and
he
behaves
like
one
And
the
old
man
put
on
his
cap
and
went
off
Avdotya
had
just
come
back
from
church
when
she
was
told
that
her
husband
's
uncle
was
asking
for
her
Till
then
she
had
rarely
seen
him
he
did
not
come
to
see
them
at
the
inn
and
had
the
reputation
of
being
queer
altogether
he
was
passionately
fond
of
snuff
and
was
usually
silent
She
went
out
to
him
What
do
you
want
Petrovitch
Has
anything
happened
Nothing
has
happened
Avdotya
Arefyevna
your
husband
is
asking
for
you
Has
he
come
back
Yes
Where
is
he
then
He
is
in
the
village
sitting
in
his
hut
Avdotya
was
frightened
Well
Petrovitch
she
inquired
looking
straight
into
his
face
is
he
angry
He
does
not
seem
so
Avdotya
looked
down
Well
let
us
go
she
said
She
put
on
a
shawl
and
they
set
off
together
They
walked
in
silence
to
the
village
When
they
began
to
get
close
to
the
hut
Avdotya
was
so
overcome
with
terror
that
her
knees
began
to
tremble
Good
Petrovitch
she
said
go
in
first
Tell
him
that
I
have
come
The
old
man
went
into
the
hut
and
found
Akim
lost
in
thought
sitting
just
as
he
had
left
him
Well
said
Akim
raising
his
head
has
n't
she
come
Yes
answered
the
old
man
she
is
at
the
gate
Well
send
her
in
here
The
old
man
went
out
beckoned
to
Avdotya
said
to
her
go
in
and
sat
down
again
on
the
ledge
Avdotya
in
trepidation
opened
the
door
crossed
the
threshold
and
stood
still
Akim
looked
at
her
Well
Arefyevna
he
began
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
I
am
guilty
she
faltered
Ech
Arefyevna
we
are
all
sinners
What
's
the
good
of
talking
about
it
It
's
he
the
villain
has
ruined
us
both
said
Avdotya
in
a
cringing
voice
and
tears
flowed
down
her
face
You
must
not
leave
it
like
that
Akim
Semyonitch
you
must
get
the
money
back
Do
n't
think
of
me
I
am
ready
to
take
my
oath
that
I
only
lent
him
the
money
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
could
sell
our
inn
if
she
liked
but
why
should
he
rob
us
Get
your
money
back
There
's
no
claiming
the
money
back
from
him
Akim
replied
grimly
we
have
settled
our
accounts
Avdotya
was
amazed
How
is
that
Why
like
this
Do
you
know
Akim
went
on
and
his
eyes
gleamed
do
you
know
where
I
spent
the
night
You
do
n't
know
In
Naum
's
cellar
with
my
arms
and
legs
tied
like
a
sheep
that
's
where
I
spent
the
night
I
tried
to
set
fire
to
the
place
but
he
caught
me
Naum
did
he
is
too
sharp
And
to-day
he
meant
to
take
me
to
the
town
but
he
let
me
off
so
I
ca
n't
claim
the
money
from
him
'When
did
I
borrow
money
from
you
he
would
say
Am
I
to
say
to
him
'My
wife
took
it
from
under
the
floor
and
brought
it
to
you
'Your
wife
is
telling
lies
he
will
say
Has
n't
there
been
scandal
enough
for
you
Arefyevna
You
'd
better
say
nothing
I
tell
you
say
nothing
I
am
guilty
Semyonitch
I
am
guilty
Avdotya
terrified
whispered
again
That
's
not
what
matters
said
Akim
after
a
pause
What
are
we
going
to
do
We
have
no
home
or
no
money
We
shall
manage
somehow
Akim
Semyonitch
We
'll
ask
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
she
will
help
us
Kiriliovna
has
promised
me
No
Arefyenva
you
and
your
Kirillovna
had
better
ask
her
together
you
are
berries
off
the
same
bush
I
tell
you
what
you
stay
here
and
good
luck
to
you
I
shall
not
stay
here
It
's
a
good
thing
we
have
no
children
and
I
shall
be
all
right
I
dare
say
alone
There
's
always
enough
for
one
What
will
you
do
Semyonitch
Take
up
driving
again
Akim
laughed
bitterly
I
should
be
a
fine
driver
no
mistake
You
have
pitched
on
the
right
man
for
it
No
Arefyenva
that
's
a
job
not
like
getting
married
for
instance
an
old
man
is
no
good
for
the
job
I
do
n't
want
to
stay
here
just
because
I
do
n't
want
them
to
point
the
finger
at
me
do
you
understand
I
am
going
to
pray
for
my
sins
Arefyevna
that
's
what
I
am
going
to
do
What
sins
have
you
Semyonitch
Avdotya
pronounced
timidly
Of
them
I
know
best
myself
wife
But
are
you
leaving
me
all
alone
Semyonitch
How
can
I
live
without
a
husband
Leaving
you
alone
Oh
Arefyevna
how
you
do
talk
really
Much
you
need
a
husband
like
me
and
old
too
and
ruined
as
well
Why
you
got
on
without
me
in
the
past
you
can
get
on
in
the
future
What
property
is
left
us
you
can
take
I
do
n't
want
it
As
you
like
Semyonitch
Avdotya
replied
mournfully
You
know
best
That
's
better
Only
do
n't
you
suppose
that
I
am
angry
with
you
Arefyevna
No
what
's
the
good
of
being
angry
when
I
ought
to
have
been
wiser
before
I
've
been
to
blame
I
am
punished
Akim
sighed
As
you
make
your
bed
so
you
must
lie
on
it
I
am
old
it
's
time
to
think
of
my
soul
The
Lord
himself
has
brought
me
to
understanding
Like
an
old
fool
I
wanted
to
live
for
my
own
pleasure
with
a
young
wife
No
the
old
man
had
better
pray
and
beat
his
head
against
the
earth
and
endure
in
patience
and
fast
And
now
go
along
my
dear
I
am
very
weary
I
'll
sleep
a
little
And
Akim
with
a
groan
stretched
himself
on
the
bench
Avdotya
wanted
to
say
something
stood
a
moment
looked
at
him
turned
away
and
went
out
Well
he
did
n't
beat
you
then
asked
Petrovitch
sitting
bent
up
on
the
ledge
when
she
was
level
with
him
Avdotya
passed
by
him
without
speaking
So
he
did
n't
beat
her
the
old
man
said
to
himself
he
smiled
ruffled
up
his
beard
and
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
Akim
carried
out
his
intention
He
hurriedly
arranged
his
affairs
and
a
few
days
after
the
conversation
we
have
described
went
dressed
ready
for
his
journey
to
say
goodbye
to
his
wife
who
had
settled
for
a
time
in
a
little
lodge
in
the
mistress
's
garden
His
farewell
did
not
take
long
Kirillovna
who
happened
to
be
present
advised
Akim
to
see
his
mistress
he
did
so
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
received
him
with
some
confusion
but
graciously
let
him
kiss
her
hand
and
asked
him
where
he
meant
to
go
He
answered
he
was
going
first
to
Kiev
and
after
that
where
it
would
please
the
Lord
She
commended
his
decision
and
dismissed
him
From
that
time
he
rarely
appeared
at
home
though
he
never
forgot
to
bring
his
mistress
some
holy
bread
But
wherever
Russian
pilgrims
gather
his
thin
and
aged
but
always
dignified
and
handsome
face
could
be
seen
at
the
relics
of
St
Sergey
on
the
shores
of
the
White
Sea
at
the
Optin
hermitage
and
at
the
far-away
Valaam
he
went
everywhere
This
year
he
has
passed
by
you
in
the
ranks
of
the
innumerable
people
who
go
in
procession
behind
the
ikon
of
the
Mother
of
God
to
the
Korennaya
last
year
you
found
him
sitting
with
a
wallet
on
his
shoulders
with
other
pilgrims
on
the
steps
of
Nikolay
the
wonder-worker
at
Mtsensk
he
comes
to
Moscow
almost
every
spring
From
land
to
land
he
has
wandered
with
his
quiet
unhurried
but
never-resting
step
they
say
he
has
been
even
to
Jerusalem
He
seems
perfectly
calm
and
happy
and
those
who
have
chanced
to
converse
with
him
have
said
much
of
his
piety
and
humility
Meanwhile
Naum's
fortunes
prospered
exceedingly
He
set
to
work
with
energy
and
good
sense
and
got
on
as
the
saying
is
by
leaps
and
bounds
Everyone
in
the
neighbourhood
knew
by
what
means
he
had
acquired
the
inn
they
knew
too
that
Avdotya
had
given
him
her
husband
's
money
nobody
liked
Naum
because
of
his
cold
harsh
disposition
With
censure
they
told
the
story
of
him
that
once
when
Akim
himself
had
asked
alms
under
his
window
he
answered
that
God
would
give
and
had
given
him
nothing
but
everyone
agreed
that
there
never
had
been
a
luckier
man
his
corn
came
better
than
other
people
's
his
bees
swarmed
more
frequently
even
his
hens
laid
more
eggs
his
cattle
were
never
ill
his
horses
did
not
go
lame
It
was
a
long
time
before
Avdotya
could
bear
to
hear
his
name
she
had
accepted
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
's
invitation
and
had
reentered
her
service
as
head
sewing-maid
but
in
the
end
her
aversion
was
somewhat
softened
it
was
said
that
she
had
been
driven
by
poverty
to
appeal
to
him
and
he
had
given
her
a
hundred
roubles
She
must
not
be
too
severely
judged
poverty
breaks
any
will
and
the
sudden
and
violent
change
in
her
life
had
greatly
aged
and
humbled
her
it
was
hard
to
believe
how
quickly
she
lost
her
looks
how
completely
she
let
herself
go
and
lost
heart
How
did
it
all
end
the
reader
will
ask
Why
like
this
Naum
after
having
kept
the
inn
successfully
for
about
fifteen
years
sold
it
advantageously
to
another
townsman
He
would
never
have
parted
from
the
inn
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
following
apparently
insignificant
circumstance
for
two
mornings
in
succession
his
dog
sitting
before
the
windows
had
kept
up
a
prolonged
and
doleful
howl
He
went
out
into
the
road
the
second
time
looked
attentively
at
the
howling
dog
shook
his
head
went
up
to
town
and
the
same
day
agreed
on
the
price
with
a
man
who
had
been
for
a
long
time
anxious
to
purchase
it
A
week
later
he
had
moved
to
a
distance
out
of
the
province
the
new
owner
settled
in
and
that
very
evening
the
inn
was
burnt
to
ashes
not
a
single
outbuilding
was
left
and
Naum
's
successor
was
left
a
beggar
The
reader
can
easily
imagine
the
rumours
that
this
fire
gave
rise
to
in
the
neighbourhood
Evidently
he
carried
his
luck
away
with
him
everyone
repeated
Of
Naum
it
is
said
that
he
has
gone
into
the
corn
trade
and
has
made
a
great
fortune
But
will
it
last
long
Stronger
pillars
have
fallen
and
evil
deeds
end
badly
sooner
or
later
There
is
not
much
to
say
about
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
She
is
still
living
and
as
is
often
the
case
with
people
of
her
sort
is
not
much
changed
she
has
not
even
grown
much
older
she
only
seems
to
have
dried
up
a
little
on
the
other
hand
her
stinginess
has
greatly
increased
though
it
is
difficult
to
say
for
whose
benefit
she
is
saving
as
she
has
no
children
and
no
attachments
In
conversation
she
often
speaks
of
Akim
and
declares
that
since
she
has
understood
his
good
qualities
she
has
begun
to
feel
great
respect
for
the
Russian
peasant
Kirillovna
bought
her
freedom
for
a
considerable
sum
and
married
for
love
a
fair-haired
young
waiter
who
leads
her
a
dreadful
life
Avdotya
lives
as
before
among
the
maids
in
Lizaveta
Prohorovna's
house
but
has
sunk
to
a
rather
lower
position
she
is
very
poorly
almost
dirtily
dressed
and
there
is
no
trace
left
in
her
of
the
townbred
airs
and
graces
of
a
fashionable
maid
or
of
the
habits
of
a
prosperous
innkeeper
's
wife
No
one
takes
any
notice
of
her
and
she
herself
is
glad
to
be
unnoticed
old
Petrovitch
is
dead
and
Akim
is
still
wandering
a
pilgrim
and
God
only
knows
how
much
longer
his
pilgrimage
will
last
1852
LIEUTENANT
YERGUNOV
'S
STORY
That
evening
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
Yergunov
told
us
his
story
again
He
used
to
repeat
it
punctually
once
a
month
and
we
heard
it
every
time
with
fresh
satisfaction
though
we
knew
it
almost
by
heart
in
all
its
details
Those
details
overgrew
if
one
may
so
express
it
the
original
trunk
of
the
story
itself
as
fungi
grow
over
the
stump
of
a
tree
Knowing
only
too
well
the
character
of
our
companion
we
did
not
trouble
to
fill
in
his
gaps
and
incomplete
statements
But
now
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
is
dead
and
there
will
be
no
one
to
tell
his
story
and
so
we
venture
to
bring
it
before
the
notice
of
the
public
It
happened
forty
years
ago
when
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
young
He
said
of
himself
that
he
was
at
that
time
a
handsome
fellow
and
a
dandy
with
a
complexion
of
milk
and
roses
red
lips
curly
hair
and
eyes
like
a
falcon
's
We
took
his
word
for
it
though
we
saw
nothing
of
that
sort
in
him
in
our
eyes
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
a
man
of
very
ordinary
exterior
with
a
simple
and
sleepy-looking
face
and
a
heavy
clumsy
figure
But
what
of
that
There
is
no
beauty
the
years
will
not
mar
The
traces
of
dandyism
were
more
clearly
preserved
in
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
He
still
in
his
old
age
wore
narrow
trousers
with
straps
laced
in
his
corpulent
figure
cropped
the
back
of
his
head
curled
his
hair
over
his
forehead
and
dyed
his
moustache
with
Persian
dye
which
had
however
a
tint
rather
of
purple
and
even
of
green
than
of
black
With
all
that
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
a
very
worthy
gentleman
though
at
preference
he
did
like
to
steal
a
peep
that
is
look
over
his
neighbour
's
cards
but
this
he
did
not
so
much
from
greed
as
carefulness
for
he
did
not
like
wasting
his
money
Enough
of
these
parentheses
however
let
us
come
to
the
story
itself
It
happened
in
the
spring
at
Nikolaev
at
that
time
a
new
town
to
which
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
had
been
sent
on
a
government
commission
He
was
a
lieutenant
in
the
navy
He
had
as
a
trustworthy
and
prudent
officer
been
charged
by
the
authorities
with
the
task
of
looking
after
the
construction
of
ship-yards
and
from
time
to
time
received
considerable
sums
of
money
which
for
security
he
invariably
carried
in
a
leather
belt
on
his
person
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
certainly
was
distinguished
by
his
prudence
and
in
spite
of
his
youth
his
behaviour
was
exemplary
he
studiously
avoided
every
impropriety
of
conduct
did
not
touch
cards
did
not
drink
and
even
fought
shy
of
society
so
that
of
his
comrades
the
quiet
ones
called
him
a
regular
girl
and
the
rowdy
ones
called
him
a
muff
and
a
noodle
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
had
only
one
failing
he
had
a
tender
heart
for
the
fair
sex
but
even
in
that
direction
he
succeeded
in
restraining
his
impulses
and
did
not
allow
himself
to
indulge
in
any
foolishness
He
got
up
and
went
to
bed
early
was
conscientious
in
performing
his
duties
and
his
only
recreation
consisted
in
rather
long
evening
walks
about
the
outskirts
of
Nikolaev
He
did
not
read
as
he
thought
it
would
send
the
blood
to
his
head
every
spring
he
used
to
drink
a
special
decoction
because
he
was
afraid
of
being
too
full-blooded
Putting
on
his
uniform
and
carefully
brushing
himself
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
strolled
with
a
sedate
step
alongside
the
fences
of
orchards
often
stopped
admired
the
beauties
of
nature
gathered
flowers
as
souvenirs
and
found
a
certain
pleasure
in
doing
so
but
he
felt
acute
pleasure
only
when
he
happened
to
meet
a
charmer
that
is
some
pretty
little
workgirl
with
a
shawl
flung
over
her
shoulders
with
a
parcel
in
her
ungloved
hand
and
a
gay
kerchief
on
her
head
Being
as
he
himself
expressed
it
of
a
susceptible
but
modest
temperament
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
did
not
address
the
charmer
but
smiled
ingratiatingly
at
her
and
looked
long
and
attentively
after
her
Then
he
would
heave
a
deep
sigh
go
home
with
the
same
sedate
step
sit
down
at
the
window
and
dream
for
half
an
hour
carefully
smoking
strong
tobacco
out
of
a
meerschaum
pipe
with
an
amber
mouthpiece
given
him
by
his
godfather
a
police
superintendent
of
German
origin
So
the
days
passed
neither
gaily
nor
drearily
Well
one
day
as
he
was
returning
home
along
an
empty
side-street
at
dusk
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
heard
behind
him
hurried
footsteps
and
incoherent
words
mingled
with
sobs
He
looked
round
and
saw
a
girl
about
twenty
with
an
extremely
pleasing
but
distressed
and
tear-stained
face
She
seemed
to
have
been
overtaken
by
some
great
and
unexpected
grief
She
was
running
and
stumbling
as
she
ran
talking
to
herself
exclaiming
gesticulating
her
fair
hair
was
in
disorder
and
her
shawl
the
burnous
and
the
mantle
were
unknown
in
those
days
had
slipped
off
her
shoulders
and
was
kept
on
by
one
pin
The
girl
was
dressed
like
a
young
lady
not
like
a
workgirl
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
stepped
aside
his
feeling
of
compassion
overpowered
his
fear
of
doing
something
foolish
and
when
she
caught
him
up
he
politely
touched
the
peak
of
his
shako
and
asked
her
the
cause
of
her
tears
For
he
added
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
cutlass
I
as
an
officer
may
be
able
to
help
you
The
girl
stopped
and
apparently
for
the
first
moment
did
not
clearly
understand
what
he
wanted
of
her
but
at
once
as
though
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
expressing
herself
began
speaking
in
slightly
imperfect
Russian
Oh
dear
Mr
Officer
she
began
and
tears
rained
down
her
charming
cheeks
it
is
beyond
everything
It
's
awful
it
is
beyond
words
We
have
been
robbed
the
cook
has
carried
off
everything
everything
everything
the
dinner
service
the
lock-up
box
and
our
clothes
Yes
even
our
clothes
and
stockings
and
linen
yes
and
aunt's
reticule
There
was
a
twenty-five-rouble
note
and
two
appliqu
spoons
in
it
and
her
pelisse
too
and
everything
And
I
told
all
that
to
the
police
officer
and
the
police
officer
said
'Go
away
I
don't
believe
you
I
do
n't
believe
you
I
wo
n't
listen
to
you
You
are
the
same
sort
yourselves
I
said
'Why
but
the
pelisse
and
he
'I
wo
n't
listen
to
you
I
wo
n't
listen
to
you
It
was
so
insulting
Mr
Officer
'Go
away
he
said
'get
along
but
where
am
I
to
go
The
girl
sobbed
convulsively
almost
wailing
and
utterly
distracted
leaned
against
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
's
sleeve
He
was
overcome
with
confusion
in
his
turn
and
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
only
repeating
from
time
to
time
There
there
while
he
gazed
at
the
delicate
nape
of
the
dishevelled
damsel
's
neck
as
it
shook
from
her
sobs
Will
you
let
me
see
you
home
he
said
at
last
lightly
touching
her
shoulder
with
his
forefinger
here
in
the
street
you
understand
it
is
quite
impossible
You
can
explain
your
trouble
to
me
and
of
course
I
will
make
every
effort
as
an
officer
The
girl
raised
her
head
and
seemed
for
the
first
time
to
see
the
young
man
who
might
be
said
to
be
holding
her
in
his
arms
She
was
disconcerted
turned
away
and
still
sobbing
moved
a
little
aside
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
repeated
his
suggestion
The
girl
looked
at
him
askance
through
her
hair
which
had
fallen
over
her
face
and
was
wet
with
tears
At
this
point
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
always
assured
us
that
this
glance
pierced
through
him
like
an
awl
and
even
attempted
once
to
reproduce
this
marvellous
glance
for
our
benefit
and
laying
her
hand
within
the
crooked
arm
of
the
obliging
lieutenant
set
off
with
him
for
her
lodging
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
had
had
very
little
to
do
with
ladies
and
so
was
at
a
loss
how
to
begin
the
conversation
but
his
companion
chattered
away
very
fluently
continually
drying
her
eyes
and
shedding
fresh
tears
Within
a
few
minutes
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
had
learnt
that
her
name
was
Emilie
Karlovna
that
she
came
from
Riga
and
that
she
had
come
to
Nikolaev
to
stay
with
her
aunt
who
was
from
Riga
too
that
her
papa
too
had
been
in
the
army
but
had
died
from
his
chest
that
her
aunt
had
a
Russian
cook
a
very
good
and
inexpensive
cook
but
she
had
not
a
passport
and
that
this
cook
had
that
very
day
robbed
them
and
run
away
She
had
had
to
go
to
the
police
in
die
Polizei
But
here
the
memories
of
the
police
superintendent
of
the
insult
she
had
received
from
him
surged
up
again
and
sobs
broke
out
afresh
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
once
more
at
a
loss
what
to
say
to
comfort
her
But
the
girl
whose
impressions
seemed
to
come
and
go
very
rapidly
stopped
suddenly
and
holding
out
her
hand
said
calmly
And
this
is
where
we
live
It
was
a
wretched
little
house
that
looked
as
though
it
had
sunk
into
the
ground
with
four
little
windows
looking
into
the
street
The
dark
green
of
geraniums
blocked
them
up
within
a
candle
was
burning
in
one
of
them
night
was
already
coming
on
A
wooden
fence
with
a
hardly
visible
gate
stretched
from
the
house
and
was
almost
of
the
same
height
The
girl
went
up
to
the
gate
and
finding
it
locked
knocked
on
it
impatiently
with
the
iron
ring
of
the
padlock
Heavy
footsteps
were
audible
behind
the
fence
as
though
someone
in
slippers
trodden
down
at
heel
were
carelessly
shuffling
towards
the
gate
and
a
husky
female
voice
asked
some
question
in
German
which
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
did
not
understand
like
a
regular
sailor
he
knew
no
language
but
Russian
The
girl
answered
in
German
too
the
gate
opened
a
very
little
admitted
the
girl
and
then
was
slammed
almost
in
the
face
of
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
who
had
time
however
to
make
out
in
the
summer
twilight
the
outline
of
a
stout
elderly
woman
in
a
red
dress
with
a
dimly
burning
lantern
in
her
hand
Struck
with
amazement
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
remained
for
some
time
motionless
in
the
street
but
at
the
thought
that
he
a
naval
officer
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
his
rank
had
been
so
discourteously
treated
he
was
moved
to
indignation
and
turning
on
his
heel
he
went
homewards
He
had
not
gone
ten
paces
when
the
gate
opened
again
and
the
girl
who
had
had
time
to
whisper
to
the
old
woman
appeared
in
the
gateway
and
called
out
aloud
Where
are
you
going
Mr
Officer
Please
come
in
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
hesitated
a
little
he
turned
back
however
This
new
acquaintance
whom
we
will
call
Emilie
led
him
through
a
dark
damp
little
lobby
into
a
fairly
large
but
low-pitched
and
untidy
room
with
a
huge
cupboard
against
the
