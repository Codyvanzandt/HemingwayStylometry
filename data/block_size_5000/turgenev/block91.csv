him
with
me
and
pressed
me
to
go
and
see
him
directly
I
was
back
I
read
this
note
with
dissatisfaction
but
the
next
day
I
set
off
to
the
Gagins
Gagin
met
me
in
friendly
fashion
and
overwhelmed
me
with
affectionate
reproaches
but
Acia
as
though
intentionally
burst
out
laughing
for
no
reason
whatever
directly
she
saw
me
and
promptly
ran
away
as
she
so
often
did
Gagin
was
disconcerted
he
muttered
after
her
that
she
must
be
crazy
and
begged
me
to
excuse
her
I
confess
I
was
very
much
annoyed
with
Acia
already
apart
from
that
I
was
not
at
my
ease
and
now
again
this
unnatural
laughter
these
strange
grimaces
I
pretended
however
not
to
notice
anything
and
began
telling
Gagin
some
of
the
incidents
of
my
short
tour
He
told
me
what
he
had
been
doing
in
my
absence
But
our
talk
did
not
flow
easily
Acia
came
into
the
room
and
ran
out
again
I
declared
at
last
that
I
had
urgent
work
to
do
and
must
get
back
home
Gagin
at
first
tried
to
keep
me
then
looking
intently
at
me
offered
to
see
me
on
my
way
In
the
passage
Acia
suddenly
came
up
to
me
and
held
out
her
hand
I
shook
her
fingers
very
slightly
and
barely
bowed
to
her
Gagin
and
I
crossed
the
Rhine
together
and
when
we
reached
my
favourite
ash-tree
with
the
statuette
of
the
Madonna
we
sat
down
on
the
bench
to
admire
the
view
A
remarkable
conversation
took
place
between
us
At
first
we
exchanged
a
few
words
then
we
were
silent
watching
the
clear
river
Tell
me
began
Gagin
all
at
once
with
his
habitual
smile
what
do
you
think
of
Acia
I
suppose
she
must
strike
you
as
rather
strange
doesn
t
she
Yes
I
answered
in
some
perplexity
I
had
not
expected
he
would
begin
to
speak
of
her
One
has
to
know
her
well
to
judge
of
her
he
observed
she
has
a
very
good
heart
but
she
s
wilful
She
s
difficult
to
get
on
with
But
you
couldn
t
blame
her
if
you
knew
her
story
Her
story
I
broke
in
Why
isn
t
she
your
Gagin
glanced
at
me
Do
you
really
think
she
isn
t
my
sister
No
he
went
on
paying
no
attention
to
my
confusion
she
really
is
my
sister
she
s
my
father
s
daughter
Let
me
tell
you
about
her
I
feel
I
can
trust
you
and
I
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
My
father
was
very
kind
clever
cultivated
and
unhappy
Fate
treated
him
no
worse
than
others
but
he
could
not
get
over
her
first
blow
He
married
early
for
love
his
wife
my
mother
died
very
soon
after
I
was
only
six
months
old
then
My
father
took
me
away
with
him
to
his
country
place
and
for
twelve
years
he
never
went
out
anywhere
He
looked
after
my
education
himself
and
would
never
have
parted
with
me
if
his
brother
my
uncle
had
not
come
to
see
us
in
the
country
This
uncle
always
lived
in
Petersburg
where
he
held
a
very
important
post
He
persuaded
my
father
to
put
me
in
his
charge
as
my
father
would
not
on
any
consideration
agree
to
leave
the
country
My
uncle
represented
to
him
that
it
was
bad
for
a
boy
of
my
age
to
live
in
complete
solitude
that
with
such
a
constantly
depressed
and
taciturn
instructor
as
my
father
I
should
infallibly
be
much
behind
other
boys
of
my
age
in
education
and
that
my
character
even
might
very
possibly
suffer
My
father
resisted
his
brother
s
counsels
a
long
while
but
he
gave
way
at
last
I
cried
at
parting
from
my
father
I
loved
him
though
I
had
never
seen
a
smile
on
his
face
but
when
I
got
to
Petersburg
I
soon
forgot
our
dark
and
cheerless
home
I
entered
a
cadet
s
school
and
from
school
passed
on
into
a
regiment
of
the
Guards
Every
year
I
used
to
go
home
to
the
country
for
a
few
weeks
and
every
year
I
found
my
father
more
and
more
low-spirited
absorbed
in
himself
depressed
and
even
timorous
He
used
to
go
to
church
every
day
and
had
quite
got
out
of
the
way
of
talking
On
one
of
my
visits
I
was
about
twenty
then
I
saw
for
the
first
time
in
our
house
a
thin
dark-eyed
little
girl
of
ten
years
old
Acia
My
father
told
me
she
was
an
orphan
whom
he
had
kept
out
of
charity
that
was
his
very
expression
I
paid
no
particular
attention
to
her
she
was
shy
quick
in
her
movements
and
silent
as
a
little
wild
animal
and
directly
I
went
into
my
father
s
favourite
room
an
immense
gloomy
apartment
where
my
mother
had
died
and
where
candles
were
kept
burning
even
in
the
daytime
she
would
hide
at
once
behind
his
big
arm-chair
or
behind
the
book-case
It
so
happened
that
for
three
or
four
years
after
that
visit
the
duties
of
the
service
prevented
my
going
home
to
the
country
I
used
to
get
a
short
letter
from
my
father
every
month
Acia
he
rarely
mentioned
and
only
incidentally
He
was
over
fifty
but
he
seemed
still
young
Imagine
my
horror
all
of
a
sudden
suspecting
nothing
I
received
a
letter
from
the
steward
in
which
he
informed
me
my
father
was
dangerously
ill
and
begged
me
to
come
as
soon
as
possible
if
I
wanted
to
take
leave
of
him
I
galloped
off
post-haste
and
found
my
father
still
alive
but
almost
at
his
last
gasp
He
was
greatly
relieved
to
see
me
clasped
me
in
his
wasted
arms
and
gazed
at
me
with
a
long
half-scrutinising
half-imploring
look
and
making
me
promise
I
would
carry
out
his
last
request
he
told
his
old
valet
to
bring
Acia
The
old
man
brought
her
in
she
could
scarcely
stand
upright
and
was
shaking
all
over
Here
said
my
father
with
an
effort
I
confide
to
you
my
daughter
your
sister
You
will
hear
all
about
her
from
Yakov
he
added
pointing
to
the
valet
Acia
sobbed
and
fell
with
her
face
on
the
bed
Half-an-hour
later
my
father
died
This
was
what
I
learned
Acia
was
the
daughter
of
my
father
by
a
former
maidservant
of
my
mother
s
Tatiana
I
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
this
Tatiana
I
remember
her
tall
slender
figure
her
handsome
stern
clever
face
with
big
dark
eyes
She
had
the
character
of
being
a
proud
unapproachable
girl
As
far
as
I
could
find
out
from
Yakov
s
respectful
unfinished
sentences
my
father
had
become
attached
to
her
some
years
after
my
mother
s
death
Tatiana
was
not
living
then
in
my
father
s
house
but
in
the
hut
of
a
married
sister
who
had
charge
of
the
cows
My
father
became
exceedingly
fond
of
her
and
after
my
departure
from
the
country
he
even
wanted
to
marry
her
but
she
herself
would
not
consent
to
be
his
wife
in
spite
of
his
entreaties
The
deceased
Tatiana
Vassilievna
Yakov
informed
me
standing
in
the
doorway
with
his
hands
behind
him
had
good
sense
in
everything
and
she
didn
t
want
to
do
harm
to
your
father
A
poor
wife
I
should
be
for
you
a
poor
sort
of
lady
I
should
make
so
she
was
pleased
to
say
she
said
so
before
me
Tatiana
would
not
even
move
into
the
house
and
went
on
living
at
her
sister
s
with
Acia
In
my
childhood
I
used
to
see
Tatiana
only
on
saints
days
in
church
With
her
head
tied
up
in
a
dark
kerchief
and
a
yellow
shawl
on
her
shoulders
she
used
to
stand
in
the
crowd
near
a
window
her
stern
profile
used
to
stand
out
sharply
against
the
transparent
window-pane
and
she
used
to
pray
sedately
and
gravely
bowing
low
to
the
ground
in
the
old-fashioned
way
When
my
uncle
carried
me
off
Acia
was
only
two
years
old
and
she
lost
her
mother
when
she
was
nine
Directly
Tatiana
died
my
father
took
Acia
into
his
house
He
had
before
then
expressed
a
wish
to
have
her
with
him
but
that
too
Tatiana
had
refused
him
Imagine
what
must
have
passed
in
Acia
s
mind
when
she
was
taken
into
the
master
s
house
To
this
day
she
can
not
forget
the
moment
when
they
first
put
her
on
a
silk
dress
and
kissed
her
hand
Her
mother
as
long
as
she
lived
had
brought
her
up
very
strictly
with
my
father
she
enjoyed
absolute
freedom
He
was
her
tutor
she
saw
no
one
except
him
He
did
not
spoil
her
that
is
to
say
he
didn
t
fondle
and
pet
her
but
he
loved
her
passionately
and
never
checked
her
in
anything
in
his
heart
he
considered
he
had
wronged
her
Acia
soon
realised
that
she
was
the
chief
personage
in
the
house
she
knew
the
master
was
her
father
but
just
as
quickly
she
was
aware
of
her
false
position
self-consciousness
was
strongly
developed
in
her
mistrustfulness
too
bad
habits
took
root
simplicity
was
lost
She
wanted
she
confessed
this
to
me
once
herself
to
force
the
whole
world
to
forget
her
origin
she
was
ashamed
of
her
mother
and
at
the
same
time
ashamed
of
being
ashamed
and
was
proud
of
her
too
You
see
she
knew
and
knows
a
lot
that
she
oughtn
t
to
have
known
at
her
age
But
was
it
her
fault
The
forces
of
youth
were
at
work
in
her
her
heart
was
in
a
ferment
and
not
a
guiding
hand
near
her
Absolute
independence
in
everything
And
wasn
t
it
hard
for
her
to
put
up
with
She
wanted
to
be
as
good
as
other
young
ladies
she
flew
to
books
But
what
good
could
she
get
from
that
Her
life
went
on
as
irregularly
as
it
had
begun
but
her
heart
was
not
spoiled
her
intellect
was
uninjured
And
there
was
I
left
a
boy
of
twenty
with
a
girl
of
thirteen
on
my
hands
For
the
first
few
days
after
my
father
s
death
the
very
sound
of
my
voice
threw
her
into
a
fever
my
caresses
caused
her
anguish
and
it
was
only
slowly
and
gradually
that
she
got
used
to
me
It
is
true
that
later
when
she
fully
realised
that
I
really
did
acknowledge
her
as
my
sister
and
cared
for
her
she
became
passionately
attached
to
me
she
can
feel
nothing
by
halves
I
took
her
to
Petersburg
Painful
as
it
was
to
part
with
her
we
could
not
live
together
I
sent
her
to
one
of
the
best
boarding-schools
Acia
knew
our
separation
was
inevitable
yet
she
began
by
fretting
herself
ill
over
it
and
almost
died
Later
on
she
plucked
up
more
spirit
and
spent
four
years
at
school
but
contrary
to
my
expectations
she
was
almost
exactly
the
same
as
before
The
headmistress
of
the
school
often
made
complaints
of
her
And
we
can
t
punish
her
she
used
to
say
to
me
and
she
s
not
amenable
to
kindness
Acia
was
exceedingly
quick-witted
and
did
better
at
her
lessons
than
any
one
but
she
never
would
put
herself
on
a
level
with
the
rest
she
was
perverse
and
held
herself
aloof
I
could
not
blame
her
very
much
for
it
in
her
position
she
had
either
to
be
subservient
or
to
hold
herself
aloof
Of
all
her
school-fellows
she
only
made
friends
with
one
an
ugly
girl
of
poor
family
who
was
sat
upon
by
the
rest
The
other
girls
with
whom
she
was
brought
up
mostly
of
good
family
did
not
like
her
teased
her
and
taunted
her
as
far
as
they
could
Acia
would
not
give
way
to
them
an
inch
One
day
at
their
lesson
on
the
law
of
God
the
teacher
was
talking
of
the
vices
Servility
and
cowardice
are
the
worst
vices
Acia
said
aloud
She
would
still
go
her
own
way
in
fact
only
her
manners
were
improved
though
even
in
that
respect
I
think
she
did
not
gain
a
great
deal
At
last
she
reached
her
seventeenth
year
I
could
not
keep
her
any
longer
at
school
I
found
myself
in
a
rather
serious
difficulty
Suddenly
a
blessed
idea
came
to
me
to
resign
my
commission
and
go
abroad
for
a
year
or
two
taking
Acia
with
me
No
sooner
thought
than
done
and
here
we
are
on
the
banks
of
the
Rhine
where
I
am
trying
to
take
up
painting
and
she
is
as
naughty
and
troublesome
as
ever
But
now
I
hope
you
will
not
judge
her
too
harshly
for
though
she
pretends
she
doesn
t
care
she
values
the
good
opinion
of
every
one
and
yours
particularly
And
Gagin
smiled
again
his
gentle
smile
I
pressed
his
hand
warmly
That
s
how
it
is
Gagin
began
again
but
I
have
a
trying
time
with
her
She
s
like
gun-powder
always
ready
to
go
off
So
far
she
has
never
taken
a
fancy
to
any
one
but
woe
betide
us
if
she
falls
in
love
I
sometimes
don
t
know
what
to
do
with
her
The
other
day
she
took
some
notion
into
her
head
and
suddenly
began
declaring
I
was
colder
to
her
than
I
used
to
be
that
she
loved
me
and
no
one
else
and
never
would
love
any
one
else
And
she
cried
so
as
she
said
it
So
that
was
it
I
was
beginning
but
I
bit
my
tongue
Tell
me
I
questioned
Gagin
we
have
talked
so
frankly
about
everything
is
it
possible
really
she
has
never
cared
for
any
one
yet
Didn
t
she
see
any
young
men
in
Petersburg
She
didn
t
like
them
at
all
No
Acia
wants
a
hero
an
exceptional
individual
or
a
picturesque
shepherd
on
a
mountain
pass
But
I
ve
been
chattering
away
and
keeping
you
he
added
getting
up
Do
you
know
I
began
let
s
go
back
to
your
place
I
don
t
want
to
go
home
What
about
your
work
I
made
no
reply
Gagin
smiled
good-humouredly
and
we
went
back
to
L
As
I
caught
sight
of
the
familiar
vineyard
and
little
white
house
I
felt
a
certain
sweetness
yes
sweetness
in
my
heart
as
though
honey
was
stealthily
dropping
thence
for
me
My
heart
was
light
after
what
Gagin
had
told
me
Acia
met
us
in
the
very
doorway
of
the
house
I
expected
a
laugh
again
but
she
came
to
meet
us
pale
and
silent
with
downcast
eyes
Here
he
is
again
Gagin
began
and
he
wanted
to
come
back
of
his
own
accord
observe
Acia
looked
at
me
inquiringly
It
was
my
turn
now
to
hold
out
my
hand
and
this
time
I
pressed
her
chilly
fingers
warmly
I
felt
very
sorry
for
her
I
understood
now
a
great
deal
in
her
that
had
puzzled
me
before
her
inward
restlessness
her
want
of
breeding
her
desire
to
be
striking
all
became
clear
to
me
I
had
had
a
peep
into
that
soul
a
secret
scourge
was
always
tormenting
her
her
ignorant
self-consciousness
struggled
in
confused
alarm
but
her
whole
nature
strove
towards
truth
I
understood
why
this
strange
little
girl
attracted
me
it
was
not
only
by
the
half-wild
charm
of
her
slender
body
that
she
attracted
me
I
liked
her
soul
Gagin
began
rummaging
among
his
canvases
I
suggested
to
Acia
that
she
should
take
a
turn
with
me
in
the
vineyard
She
agreed
at
once
with
cheerful
and
almost
humble
readiness
We
went
half-way
down
the
mountain
and
sat
down
on
a
broad
stone
And
you
weren
t
dull
without
us
Acia
began
And
were
you
dull
without
me
I
queried
Acia
gave
me
a
sidelong
look
Yes
she
answered
Was
it
nice
in
the
mountains
she
went
on
at
once
Were
they
high
ones
Higher
than
the
clouds
Tell
me
what
you
saw
You
were
telling
my
brother
but
I
didn
t
hear
anything
It
was
of
your
own
accord
you
went
away
I
remarked
I
went
away
because
I
m
not
going
away
now
she
added
with
a
confiding
caress
in
her
voice
You
were
angry
to-day
I
Yes
you
Upon
my
word
whatever
for
I
don
t
know
but
you
were
angry
and
you
went
away
angry
I
was
very
much
vexed
that
you
went
away
like
that
and
I
m
so
glad
you
came
back
And
I
m
glad
I
came
back
I
observed
Acia
gave
herself
a
little
shrug
as
children
often
do
when
they
are
very
pleased
Oh
I
m
good
at
guessing
she
went
on
Sometimes
simply
from
the
way
papa
coughed
I
could
tell
in
the
next
room
whether
he
was
pleased
with
me
or
not
Till
that
day
Acia
had
never
once
spoken
to
me
of
her
father
I
was
struck
by
it
Were
you
fond
of
your
father
I
said
and
suddenly
to
my
intense
annoyance
I
felt
I
was
reddening
She
made
no
answer
and
blushed
too
We
were
both
silent
In
the
distance
a
smoking
steamer
was
scudding
along
on
the
Rhine
We
began
watching
it
Why
don
t
you
tell
me
about
your
tour
Acia
murmured
Why
did
you
laugh
to-day
directly
you
saw
me
I
asked
I
don
t
know
really
Sometimes
I
want
to
cry
but
I
laugh
You
mustn
t
judge
me
by
what
I
do
Oh
by-the-bye
what
a
story
that
is
about
the
Lorelei
Is
that
her
rock
we
can
see
They
say
she
used
to
drown
every
one
but
as
soon
as
she
fell
in
love
she
threw
herself
in
the
water
I
like
that
story
Frau
Luise
tells
me
all
sorts
of
stories
Frau
Luise
has
a
black
cat
with
yellow
eyes
Acia
raised
her
head
and
shook
her
curls
Ah
I
am
happy
she
said
At
that
instant
there
floated
across
to
us
broken
monotonous
sounds
Hundreds
of
voices
in
unison
and
at
regular
intervals
were
repeating
a
chanted
litany
The
crowd
of
pilgrims
moved
slowly
along
the
road
below
with
crosses
and
banners
I
should
like
to
go
with
them
said
Acia
listening
to
the
sounds
of
the
voices
gradually
growing
fainter
Are
you
so
religious
I
should
like
to
go
far
away
on
a
pilgrimage
on
some
great
exploit
she
went
on
As
it
is
the
days
pass
by
life
passes
by
and
what
have
we
done
You
are
ambitious
I
observed
You
want
to
live
to
some
purpose
to
leave
some
trace
behind
you
Is
that
impossible
then
Impossible
I
was
on
the
point
of
repeating
But
I
glanced
at
her
bright
eyes
and
only
said
You
can
try
Tell
me
began
Acia
after
a
brief
silence
during
which
shadows
passed
over
her
face
which
had
already
turned
pale
did
you
care
much
for
that
lady
You
remember
my
brother
drank
her
health
at
the
ruins
the
day
after
we
first
knew
you
I
laughed
Your
brother
was
joking
I
never
cared
for
any
lady
at
any
rate
I
don
t
care
for
one
now
And
what
do
you
like
in
women
she
asked
throwing
back
her
head
with
innocent
curiosity
What
a
strange
question
I
cried
Acia
was
a
little
disconcerted
I
ought
not
to
ask
you
such
a
question
ought
I
Forgive
me
I
m
used
to
chattering
away
about
anything
that
comes
into
my
head
That
s
why
I
m
afraid
to
speak
Speak
for
God
s
sake
don
t
be
afraid
I
hastened
to
intervene
I
m
so
glad
you
re
leaving
off
being
shy
at
last
Acia
looked
down
and
laughed
a
soft
light-hearted
laugh
I
had
never
heard
such
a
laugh
from
her
Well
tell
me
about
something
she
went
on
stroking
out
the
skirt
of
her
dress
and
arranging
the
folds
over
her
legs
as
though
she
were
settling
herself
for
a
long
while
tell
me
or
read
me
something
just
as
you
read
us
do
you
remember
from
Oniegin
She
suddenly
grew
pensive
Where
now
is
the
cross
and
the
branches
shade
Over
my
poor
mother
s
grave
She
murmured
in
a
low
voice
That
s
not
as
it
is
in
Pushkin
I
observed
But
I
should
like
to
have
been
Tatiana
she
went
on
in
the
same
dreamy
tone
Tell
me
a
story
she
suddenly
added
eagerly
But
I
was
not
in
a
mood
for
telling
stories
I
was
watching
her
all
bathed
in
the
bright
sunshine
all
peace
and
gentleness
Everything
was
joyously
radiant
about
us
below
and
above
us
sky
earth
and
waters
the
very
air
seemed
saturated
with
brilliant
light
Look
how
beautiful
I
said
unconsciously
sinking
my
voice
Yes
it
is
beautiful
she
answered
just
as
softly
not
looking
at
me
If
only
you
and
I
were
birds
how
we
would
soar
how
we
would
fly
We
d
simply
plunge
into
that
blue
But
we
re
not
birds
But
we
may
grow
wings
I
rejoined
How
so
Live
a
little
longer
and
you
ll
find
out
There
are
feelings
that
lift
us
above
the
earth
Don
t
trouble
yourself
you
will
have
wings
Have
you
had
them
How
shall
I
say
I
think
up
till
now
I
never
have
taken
flight
Acia
grew
pensive
once
more
I
bent
a
little
towards
her
Can
you
waltz
she
asked
me
suddenly
Yes
I
answered
rather
puzzled
Well
come
along
then
come
along
I
ll
ask
my
brother
to
play
us
a
waltz
We
ll
fancy
we
are
flying
that
our
wings
have
grown
She
ran
into
the
house
I
ran
after
her
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
turning
round
and
round
the
narrow
little
room
to
the
sweet
strains
of
Lanner
Acia
waltzed
splendidly
with
enthusiasm
Something
soft
and
womanly
suddenly
peeped
through
the
childish
severity
of
her
profile
Long
after
my
arm
kept
the
feeling
of
the
contact
of
her
soft
waist
long
after
I
heard
her
quickened
breathing
close
to
my
ear
long
after
I
was
haunted
by
dark
immobile
almost
closed
eyes
in
a
pale
but
eager
face
framed
in
by
fluttering
curls
All
that
day
passed
most
delightfully
We
were
as
merry
as
children
Acia
was
very
sweet
and
simple
Gagin
was
delighted
as
he
watched
her
I
went
home
late
When
I
had
got
out
into
the
middle
of
the
Rhine
I
asked
the
ferryman
to
let
the
boat
float
down
with
the
current
The
old
man
pulled
up
his
oars
and
the
majestic
river
bore
us
along
As
I
looked
about
me
listened
brooded
over
recollections
I
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
secret
restlessness
astir
in
my
heart
I
lifted
my
eyes
skywards
but
there
was
no
peace
even
in
the
sky
studded
with
stars
it
seemed
all
moving
quivering
twinkling
I
bent
over
to
the
river
but
even
there
even
in
those
cold
dark
depths
the
stars
were
trembling
and
glimmering
I
seemed
to
feel
an
exciting
quickening
of
life
on
all
sides
and
a
sense
of
alarm
rose
up
within
me
too
I
leaned
my
elbows
on
the
boat
s
edge
The
whispering
of
the
wind
in
my
ears
the
soft
gurgling
of
the
water
at
the
rudder
worked
on
my
nerves
and
the
fresh
breath
of
the
river
did
not
cool
me
a
nightingale
was
singing
on
the
bank
and
stung
me
with
the
sweet
poison
of
its
notes
Tears
rose
into
my
eyes
but
they
were
not
the
tears
of
aimless
rapture
What
I
was
feeling
was
not
the
vague
sense
I
had
known
of
late
of
all-embracing
desire
when
the
soul
expands
resounds
when
it
feels
that
it
grasps
all
loves
all
No
it
was
the
thirst
for
happiness
aflame
in
me
I
did
not
dare
yet
to
call
it
by
its
name
but
happiness
happiness
full
and
overflowing
that
was
what
I
wanted
that
was
what
I
pined
for
The
boat
floated
on
and
the
old
ferryman
sat
dozing
as
he
leant
on
his
oars
As
I
set
off
next
day
to
the
Gagins
I
did
not
ask
myself
whether
I
was
in
love
with
Acia
but
I
thought
a
great
deal
about
her
her
fate
absorbed
me
I
rejoiced
at
our
unexpected
intimacy
I
felt
that
it
was
only
yesterday
I
had
got
to
know
her
till
then
she
had
turned
away
from
me
And
now
when
she
had
at
last
revealed
herself
to
me
in
what
a
seductive
light
her
image
showed
itself
how
fresh
it
was
for
me
what
secret
fascinations
were
modestly
peeping
out
I
walked
boldly
up
the
familiar
road
gazing
continually
at
the
cottage
a
white
spot
in
the
distance
I
thought
not
of
the
future
not
even
of
the
morrow
I
was
very
happy
Acia
flushed
directly
I
came
into
the
room
I
noticed
that
she
had
dressed
herself
in
her
best
again
but
the
expression
of
her
face
was
not
in
keeping
with
her
finery
it
was
mournful
And
I
had
come
in
such
high
spirits
I
even
fancied
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
running
away
as
usual
but
she
controlled
herself
and
remained
Gagin
was
in
that
peculiar
condition
of
artistic
heat
and
intensity
which
seizes
amateurs
all
of
a
sudden
like
a
fit
when
they
imagine
they
are
succeeding
in
catching
nature
and
pinning
her
down
He
was
standing
with
dishevelled
locks
and
besmeared
with
paint
before
a
stretched
canvas
and
flourishing
the
brush
over
it
he
almost
savagely
nodded
to
me
turned
away
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
bent
again
over
his
picture
I
did
not
hinder
him
but
went
and
sat
down
by
Acia
Slowly
her
dark
eyes
turned
to
me
You
re
not
the
same
to-day
as
yesterday
I
observed
after
ineffectual
efforts
to
call
up
a
smile
on
her
lips
No
I
m
not
she
answered
in
a
slow
and
dull
voice
But
that
means
nothing
I
did
not
sleep
well
I
was
thinking
all
night
What
about
Oh
I
thought
about
so
many
things
It
s
a
way
I
have
had
from
childhood
ever
since
I
used
to
live
with
mother
She
uttered
the
word
with
an
effort
and
then
repeated
again
When
I
used
to
live
with
mother
I
used
to
think
why
it
was
no
one
could
tell
what
would
happen
to
him
and
sometimes
one
sees
trouble
coming
and
one
can
t
escape
and
how
it
is
one
can
never
tell
all
the
truth
Then
I
used
to
think
I
knew
nothing
and
that
I
ought
to
learn
I
want
to
be
educated
over
again
I
m
very
badly
educated
I
can
t
play
the
piano
I
can
t
draw
and
even
sewing
I
do
very
badly
I
have
no
talent
for
anything
I
must
be
a
very
dull
person
to
be
with
You
re
unjust
to
yourself
I
replied
you
ve
read
a
lot
you
re
cultivated
and
with
your
cleverness
Why
am
I
clever
she
asked
with
such
na
ve
interest
that
I
could
not
help
laughing
but
she
did
not
even
smile
Brother
am
I
clever
she
asked
Gagin
He
made
her
no
answer
but
went
on
working
continually
changing
brushes
and
raising
his
arm
I
don
t
know
myself
what
is
in
my
head
Acia
continued
with
the
same
dreamy
air
I
am
sometimes
afraid
of
myself
really
Ah
I
should
like
Is
it
true
that
women
ought
not
to
read
a
great
deal
A
great
deal
s
not
wanted
but
Tell
me
what
I
ought
to
read
Tell
me
what
I
ought
to
do
I
will
do
everything
you
tell
me
she
added
turning
to
me
with
innocent
confidence
I
could
not
at
once
find
a
reply
You
won
t
be
dull
with
me
though
What
nonsense
I
was
beginning
All
right
thanks
Acia
put
in
I
was
thinking
you
would
be
bored
And
her
little
hot
hand
clasped
mine
warmly
N
Gagin
cried
at
that
instant
isn
t
that
background
too
dark
I
went
up
to
him
Acia
got
up
and
went
away
She
came
back
in
an
hour
stood
in
the
doorway
and
beckoned
to
me
Listen
she
said
if
I
were
to
die
would
you
be
sorry
What
ideas
you
have
to-day
I
exclaimed
I
fancy
I
shall
die
soon
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
as
though
everything
about
me
were
saying
good-bye
It
s
better
to
die
than
live
like
this
Ah
don
t
look
at
me
like
that
I
m
not
pretending
really
Or
else
I
shall
begin
to
be
afraid
of
you
again
Why
were
you
afraid
of
me
If
I
am
queer
it
s
really
not
my
fault
she
rejoined
You
see
I
can
t
even
laugh
now
She
remained
gloomy
and
preoccupied
till
evening
Something
was
taking
place
in
her
what
I
did
not
understand
Her
eyes
often
rested
upon
me
my
heart
slowly
throbbed
under
her
enigmatic
gaze
She
appeared
composed
and
yet
as
I
watched
her
I
kept
wanting
to
tell
her
not
to
let
herself
get
excited
I
admired
her
found
a
touching
charm
in
her
pale
face
her
hesitating
slow
movements
but
she
for
some
reason
fancied
I
was
out
of
humour
Let
me
tell
you
something
she
said
to
me
not
long
before
parting
I
am
tortured
by
the
idea
that
you
consider
me
frivolous
For
the
future
believe
what
I
say
to
you
only
do
you
too
be
open
with
me
and
I
will
always
tell
you
the
truth
I
give
you
my
word
of
honour
This
word
of
honour
set
me
laughing
again
Oh
don
t
laugh
she
said
earnestly
or
I
shall
say
to
you
to-day
what
you
said
to
me
yesterday
why
are
you
laughing
and
after
a
brief
silence
she
added
Do
you
remember
you
spoke
yesterday
of
wings
My
wings
have
grown
but
I
have
nowhere
to
fly
Nonsense
I
said
all
the
ways
lie
open
before
you
Acia
looked
at
