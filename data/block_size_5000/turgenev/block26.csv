sister
tastefully
and
even
showily
dressed
the
latter
was
standing
on
the
path
and
engaged
in
stirring
Fin
's
ears
with
the
point
of
an
open
parasol
and
as
slowly
replied
Yes
I
am
alone
So
I
see
commented
Madame
with
a
smile
He
has
gone
indoors
I
suppose
Probably
And
you
have
been
reading
with
him
I
have
Anna
Sergievna
took
Katia
under
the
chin
and
raised
her
face
towards
her
own
You
have
not
quarrelled
I
hope
she
said
Oh
no
said
Katia
and
quietly
put
away
her
sister
's
hand
What
solemn
replies
Well
I
came
here
to
propose
a
walk
since
he
is
always
asking
me
to
go
one
But
to
pass
to
another
subject
some
shoes
have
arrived
for
you
from
the
town
so
you
had
better
go
and
try
them
on
Only
yesterday
I
was
noticing
how
shabby
your
old
ones
are
In
general
you
do
not
take
sufficient
pains
in
such
matters
for
you
have
charming
feet
and
also
not
ugly
hands
even
though
a
trifle
too
large
You
ought
to
take
care
of
your
feet
When
you
are
here
you
do
not
do
so
sufficiently
Madame
passed
onwards
with
a
light
rustle
of
her
handsome
gown
while
Katia
rose
from
the
bench
and
taking
the
volume
of
Heine
departed
in
another
direction
though
not
to
try
on
the
boots
'You
have
charming
feet
she
repeated
to
herself
as
she
tripped
up
the
sun-baked
steps
of
the
terrace
'You
have
charming
feet
Well
before
long
some
one
shall
be
at
them
Confusion
then
overcame
her
and
she
took
the
remaining
steps
at
a
bound
Meanwhile
Arkady
made
for
his
room
As
he
was
passing
through
the
hall
he
was
overtaken
by
the
butler
and
informed
that
Monsieur
Bazarov
was
awaiting
him
above
Evgenii
Vasilitch
exclaimed
Arkady
in
a
tone
very
much
as
of
alarm
Has
he
been
here
long
A
few
minutes
only
He
instructed
me
not
to
announce
him
to
Madame
but
to
take
him
straight
to
your
room
I
hope
that
nothing
unfortunate
has
occurred
at
home
reflected
Arkady
as
he
ran
up
the
stairs
and
opened
the
door
of
the
bedroom
But
the
first
sight
of
Bazarov
's
face
reassured
him
even
though
a
more
experienced
eye
might
have
detected
in
the
features
of
the
unlooked-for
guest
certain
signs
that
inward
turmoil
underlay
their
usual
rigidity
Clad
in
a
dust
cloak
and
a
travelling
cap
he
was
seated
on
the
window-sill
and
did
not
rise
even
when
rushing
towards
him
with
exclamations
of
astonishment
and
fussing
to
and
fro
like
a
man
who
believes
himself
to
be
overjoyed
as
well
as
desires
other
people
to
believe
it
Arkady
cried
What
a
surprise
What
has
brought
you
here
Surely
everything
at
home
is
well
and
all
are
in
good
health
Everything
at
your
home
is
well
said
Bazarov
but
all
are
not
in
good
health
However
if
your
brains
are
not
hopelessly
wandering
first
tell
them
to
bring
me
some
kvass
and
then
sit
down
and
listen
to
my
few
but
I
hope
well-chosen
words
This
quieted
Arkady
and
upon
that
Bazarov
told
him
of
the
duel
with
Paul
Petrovitch
The
recital
finished
Arkady
stood
amazed
as
well
as
distressed
But
this
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
state
he
merely
inquired
whether
his
uncle
's
wound
were
really
a
harmless
one
and
on
receiving
the
reply
that
it
was
of
a
nature
uninteresting
from
every
but
the
medical
point
of
view
forced
a
smile
Yet
all
the
while
he
felt
secretly
hurt
and
also
secretly
ashamed
This
Bazarov
seemed
to
divine
See
he
said
what
comes
of
consorting
with
feudal
folk
Should
one
's
lot
be
cast
among
them
inevitably
one
gets
drawn
into
their
knightly
tourneys
Being
on
my
way
to
my
parents
place
I
have
turned
aside
to
But
no
I
will
not
be
guilty
of
a
foolish
and
useless
lie
The
real
reason
why
I
have
turned
aside
is
that
oh
the
devil
only
knows
why
Times
there
are
when
a
man
ought
to
take
himself
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
uproot
himself
like
a
radish
from
a
garden
border
That
is
what
I
did
when
I
was
last
here
But
since
a
longing
has
come
upon
me
to
take
just
another
peep
at
all
that
I
then
forsook
to
view
once
more
the
border
where
I
used
to
grow
By
the
words
'all
that
I
then
forsook
I
hope
that
you
do
not
mean
myself
as
well
cried
Arkady
anxiously
Do
not
say
that
you
intend
to
sever
me
also
from
your
friendship
Bazarov
looked
at
him
He
did
so
fixedly
almost
sharply
Would
the
eventuality
distress
you
he
inquired
Rather
it
is
you
who
have
forsaken
me
O
verdant
and
transparent
soul
Inter
alia
I
hope
that
your
affair
with
Anna
Sergievna
is
progressing
My
'affair
with
Anna
Sergievna
For
her
sake
was
it
not
you
came
hither
from
the
town
Ah
tender
young
chicken
of
mine
what
about
those
Sunday
Schools
Come
come
Do
not
tell
me
that
you
are
not
in
love
with
her
Or
have
you
at
last
learnt
to
be
secretive
Always
I
have
been
frank
with
you
as
you
know
wherefore
pray
believe
me
when
I
say
I
call
God
to
witness
that
it
is
true
that
your
surmises
are
mistaken
Truly
a
new
song
remarked
Bazarov
sotto
voce
But
do
not
disturb
yourself
it
is
all
one
to
me
Certainly
a
Romanticist
would
have
said
'Our
roads
are
beginning
to
diverge
but
I
say
no
more
than
that
clearly
we
have
no
further
use
for
one
another
Oh
Evgenii
Dear
lad
it
is
no
misfortune
At
all
times
is
something
in
the
world
finding
out
that
it
has
no
use
for
something
else
So
we
must
say
good-bye
Ever
since
I
arrived
in
this
place
I
have
been
feeling
as
uncomfortable
as
a
Governor
's
lady
when
she
hears
a
work
of
Gogol's
read
aloud
In
fact
I
did
not
order
my
horses
to
be
unharnessed
But
you
can
not
act
like
this
Why
not
Because
apart
from
my
own
feelings
such
a
speedy
departure
would
be
the
height
of
rudeness
to
Anna
Sergievna
I
know
that
she
would
like
to
see
you
No
she
would
not
I
am
positive
that
she
would
Why
pretend
like
this
Are
you
going
to
say
that
it
is
not
for
her
sake
alone
that
you
are
here
You
have
grounds
for
that
surmise
yet
I
say
that
you
are
wrong
But
Arkady
proved
to
be
right
for
Anna
Sergievna
really
desired
to
see
Bazarov
and
through
the
butler
sent
him
word
to
that
effect
After
tidying
his
costume
therefore
and
tucking
his
new
great-coat
under
his
arm
in
readiness
to
depart
as
soon
as
the
interview
should
be
concluded
he
went
downstairs
and
was
received
not
in
the
room
where
he
had
unexpectedly
disclosed
his
passion
but
in
the
drawing-room
Anna
Sergievna
's
manner
as
she
offered
him
the
tips
of
her
fingers
was
pleasant
enough
yet
her
face
betrayed
involuntary
tension
To
begin
with
Bazarov
hastened
to
say
allow
me
to
reassure
you
You
see
before
you
a
corpse
which
has
long
returned
to
its
senses
and
is
also
not
destitute
of
hope
that
others
have
forgotten
its
folly
I
am
unlikely
to
see
you
again
for
an
extended
period
but
though
as
you
know
I
am
not
given
to
sentiment
I
feel
that
I
should
like
to
bear
away
with
me
the
thought
that
my
image
still
fills
your
mind
with
aversion
She
caught
at
her
breath
like
a
person
who
has
just
arrived
at
the
summit
of
a
lofty
mountain
Then
her
face
lightened
into
a
smile
and
offering
Bazarov
her
hand
a
second
time
she
allowed
it
to
respond
to
the
pressure
of
his
When
sorrow
is
asleep
do
not
wake
it
she
said
And
the
less
so
since
my
conscience
convicts
me
if
not
of
coquetry
on
that
occasion
at
all
events
of
something
else
One
word
more
Let
us
be
friends
again
For
it
was
all
a
dream
was
it
not
And
who
remembers
dreams
Who
indeed
And
love
well
love
is
a
mere
empirical
sentiment
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
Thus
Anna
Sergievna
and
thus
Bazarov
And
both
conceived
themselves
to
be
speaking
the
truth
But
was
it
the
truth
at
all
events
the
whole
truth
The
speakers
themselves
did
not
know
and
therefore
the
author
does
not
Nevertheless
both
the
man
and
the
woman
framed
their
words
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
mutual
confidence
Next
Anna
Sergievna
asked
Bazarov
how
he
had
spent
his
time
at
the
Kirsanovs
and
though
he
came
within
an
ace
of
telling
her
of
the
duel
with
Paul
Petrovitch
he
checked
himself
in
time
and
replied
that
he
had
been
engaged
in
work
And
I
she
said
have
been
for
some
unknown
reason
out
of
humour
and
meditating
going
abroad
but
the
fit
is
passing
now
thanks
to
the
arrival
of
your
friend
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
and
already
I
find
myself
relapsing
into
my
old
rut
and
resuming
my
true
rôle
And
what
is
your
true
rôle
The
rôle
of
acting
as
aunt
or
preceptress
or
mother
call
it
what
you
like
to
my
sister
In
passing
I
wonder
if
you
are
aware
that
once
upon
a
time
I
did
not
altogether
understand
your
close
friendship
with
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
Somehow
he
seemed
too
insignificant
for
you
But
now
I
know
him
better
and
have
convinced
myself
that
in
his
head
there
is
a
brain
Above
all
things
he
is
young
young
not
like
you
and
myself
Evgenii
Vasilitch
But
he
is
still
shy
in
your
presence
queried
Bazarov
He
began
Anna
Sergievna
then
checking
herself
continued
No
he
is
gaining
confidence
and
has
taken
to
talking
to
me
quite
freely
whereas
once
upon
a
time
though
I
did
not
seek
his
company
he
used
to
flee
whenever
I
came
near
him
By
the
way
he
is
great
friends
with
Katia
Somehow
this
irritated
Bazarov
Never
can
a
woman
forbear
dissembling
was
his
reflection
Aloud
he
said
with
a
frigid
smile
Then
you
say
that
he
used
to
flee
from
you
But
surely
it
can
not
be
a
secret
that
formerly
he
cherished
for
you
une
grande
passion
What
He
too
Yes
he
too
affirmed
Bazarov
with
a
nod
But
I
think
that
you
knew
that
It
was
not
a
piece
of
news
that
I
have
just
told
you
Her
eyes
became
fixed
upon
the
floor
I
believe
you
to
be
wrong
she
observed
So
do
not
I
But
perhaps
I
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
it
To
himself
he
added
And
perhaps
you
will
not
in
future
play
the
hypocrite
with
me
Why
should
you
not
have
mentioned
it
she
queried
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
believe
you
to
be
attaching
importance
to
a
mere
passing
impression
and
shall
soon
think
that
you
have
a
tendency
to
exaggerate
Suppose
we
talk
of
something
else
he
suggested
For
what
reason
However
of
her
own
accord
she
diverted
the
conversation
into
another
channel
True
she
had
assured
him
and
she
herself
believed
that
everything
was
buried
in
the
past
yet
she
felt
ill
at
ease
and
conscious
that
even
while
jesting
or
exchanging
the
merest
of
bagatelles
she
had
weighing
upon
her
a
nervous
oppression
In
fact
it
was
akin
to
the
case
of
passengers
afloat
Though
such
folk
will
laugh
and
talk
with
the
same
apparent
indifference
as
on
land
let
but
the
machinery
stop
or
the
least
sign
of
anything
unusual
appear
and
at
once
every
face
will
display
that
peculiar
expression
of
anxiety
which
comes
only
of
constant
knowledge
of
ever-present
danger
Of
similar
sort
was
Anna
Sergievna
's
interview
with
Bazarov
nor
was
it
prolonged
in
that
soon
she
began
to
feel
so
absent-minded
and
to
answer
with
such
vagueness
that
she
proposed
a
move
to
the
hall
where
there
were
found
Katia
and
the
Princess
And
where
is
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
inquired
the
hostess
and
on
being
told
that
he
had
not
been
seen
for
over
an
hour
she
sent
messengers
to
summon
him
But
this
proved
a
lengthy
task
seeing
that
he
had
withdrawn
to
the
remotest
corner
of
the
garden
and
sitting
with
chin
upon
hands
was
plunged
in
thought
Those
thoughts
were
important
and
profound
but
not
sad
and
though
he
knew
that
Anna
Sergievna
was
alone
with
Bazarov
he
felt
none
of
his
old
jealousy
but
rather
gazed
before
him
with
quiet
cheerfulness
with
an
air
as
though
something
had
pleased
and
surprised
him
and
led
him
to
arrive
at
a
certain
decision
1
Yasen
is
derived
from
the
adjective
yasni
meaning
clear
or
bright
Although
the
late
Monsieur
Odintsov
had
disliked
innovations
he
had
not
been
opposed
to
the
indulgence
of
a
certain
play
of
refined
taste
and
had
erected
in
a
space
between
the
hothouses
and
the
lake
a
building
modelled
in
the
style
of
a
Greek
temple
but
consisting
of
undeniable
Russian
bricks
Also
he
had
caused
to
be
inserted
in
the
massive
rear
wall
of
this
temple
or
gallery
six
niches
for
six
statues
which
were
designed
to
represent
Solitude
Silence
Thought
Melancholy
Modesty
and
Sensibility
and
which
he
had
purposed
to
import
from
abroad
but
only
one
of
these
the
statue
of
the
Goddess
of
Silence
with
a
finger
to
her
lips
had
actually
been
delivered
and
erected
and
even
of
that
the
household
underlings
had
knocked
off
the
nose
on
the
very
day
of
the
statue
's
arrival
True
a
neighbouring
sculptor
had
offered
to
furnish
the
goddess
with
a
nose
twice
as
good
as
the
last
one
but
Odintsov
had
none
the
less
ordered
her
removal
to
a
corner
of
the
millhouse
where
for
several
years
past
she
had
acted
as
a
source
of
superstitious
awe
to
the
peasant
women
of
the
district
Likewise
the
front
wall
of
the
temple
had
become
so
overgrown
with
bushes
that
only
the
capitals
of
the
supporting
columns
remained
visible
above
the
mass
of
verdure
and
even
at
midday
the
interior
of
the
building
was
cool
and
pleasant
and
though
Anna
Sergievna
had
never
really
liked
the
place
since
the
day
when
she
had
discovered
an
adder
there
Katia
paid
it
frequent
visits
and
seating
herself
on
a
great
stone
bench
which
was
fixed
under
one
of
the
niches
would
read
or
work
or
surrender
herself
to
the
influence
of
that
perfect
restfulness
which
known
probably
to
every
one
comes
of
a
silent
half-unconscious
contemplation
of
the
great
waves
of
life
as
they
break
for
ever
around
and
against
us
On
the
morning
after
Bazarov
's
arrival
Katia
was
in
her
usual
position
on
the
bench
and
beside
her
was
Arkady
he
having
specially
asked
her
to
accompany
him
thither
Though
an
hour
was
still
wanting
to
luncheon
time
the
dew
and
the
freshness
of
the
morning
had
already
given
place
to
the
sultriness
and
the
aridity
of
noontide
Arkady
's
face
yet
bore
the
expression
of
yesterday
but
Katia
's
features
were
stamped
with
one
rather
of
depression
This
was
because
after
breakfast
her
sister
had
called
her
into
the
boudoir
and
to
some
of
those
blandishments
which
always
alarmed
the
girl
had
added
a
word
of
advice
that
Katia
should
observe
more
caution
in
her
converse
with
Arkady
and
above
all
things
avoid
such
solitary
tête-à-têtes
with
him
as
appeared
to
have
aroused
the
attention
of
the
household
in
general
and
of
the
Princess
in
particular
Since
the
previous
evening
Anna
Sergievna
had
been
out
of
humour
and
inasmuch
as
Katia
's
conscience
was
not
wholly
clear
of
responsibility
in
the
matter
she
had
intimated
when
yielding
to
Arkady
's
request
that
it
must
be
for
the
last
time
Katia
he
began
with
a
sort
of
easy
uneasiness
since
the
day
when
I
had
the
good
fortune
to
reside
under
the
same
roof
as
yourself
I
have
talked
to
you
on
many
different
subjects
But
one
particular
question
has
for
me
a
paramount
importance
nor
upon
that
question
have
I
yet
touched
Yesterday
you
said
that
during
my
stay
here
I
have
undergone
a
process
of
reformation
he
neither
sought
nor
avoided
Katia's
eye
and
to
be
frank
such
a
reformation
has
in
part
at
least
come
about
Better
than
any
one
else
do
you
know
that
this
is
so
you
to
whom
above
all
others
that
remaking
is
due
To
me
she
re-echoed
Yes
to
you
Arkady
repeated
No
longer
am
I
the
presumptuous
lad
who
came
here
a
short
while
ago
not
for
nothing
have
I
attained
my
twenty-third
year
And
though
I
still
wish
to
be
of
use
in
life
though
I
still
wish
to
consecrate
the
whole
of
my
faculties
to
the
service
of
Truth
I
no
longer
seek
my
ideals
where
I
was
wont
to
do
they
appear
to
me
to
stand
much
nearer
home
Hitherto
I
have
been
in
ignorance
of
myself
hitherto
I
have
set
myself
tasks
beyond
my
powers
but
now
through
a
certain
feeling
which
is
within
me
my
eyes
have
become
opened
By
the
way
the
manner
in
which
I
express
myself
may
be
lacking
in
clarity
yet
I
venture
to
hope
that
I
have
made
myself
understood
Katia
said
nothing
but
she
ceased
to
look
at
the
speaker
In
my
opinion
he
went
on
in
a
tone
of
rising
emotion
while
in
a
birch
tree
overhead
a
chaffinch
started
pouring
forth
a
flood
of
unstudied
song
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
duty
of
an
honourable
man
to
be
frank
with
those
who
with
those
who
in
short
with
those
who
stand
nearest
to
him
in
life
Consequently
I
I
am
minded
to
to
Here
Arkady
's
eloquence
failed
him
He
stumbled
and
stuttered
and
had
to
pause
for
a
moment
Meanwhile
Katia
's
eyes
remained
lowered
One
would
have
thought
that
she
did
not
in
the
least
understand
this
preamble
but
was
expecting
to
hear
something
quite
of
a
different
nature
That
I
shall
surprise
you
I
know
in
advance
continued
Arkady
once
more
spurring
his
faculties
And
that
surprise
will
be
the
greater
when
I
tell
you
that
the
feeling
to
which
I
have
alluded
concerns
to
a
certain
extent
yes
to
a
certain
extent
yourself
For
yesterday
you
will
remember
you
imputed
to
me
a
lack
of
gravity
he
was
speaking
much
like
a
man
who
having
blundered
into
a
bog
feels
that
at
each
step
he
sinks
deeper
and
deeper
yet
struggles
on
in
the
hope
of
eventually
extricating
himself
and
such
a
reproach
is
all
too
often
levelled
against
all
too
often
falls
upon
young
people
who
have
ceased
to
deserve
it
Were
I
but
possessed
of
more
self-confidence
God
help
me
God
help
me
he
thought
despairingly
but
Katia
did
not
even
turn
her
head
had
I
but
the
right
to
hope
that
Did
I
but
feel
sure
that
you
really
mean
what
you
say
broke
in
at
this
moment
the
clear
accents
of
Anna
Sergievna
Arkady
became
dumb
and
Katia
turned
pale
for
along
a
little
path
which
skirted
the
bushes
screening
the
temple
there
were
advancing
Bazarov
and
Madame
Katia
and
Arkady
could
not
actually
see
the
pair
yet
they
could
hear
every
word
uttered
and
even
catch
the
sound
of
their
breathing
and
the
rustle
of
Anna
Sergievna
's
dress
Advancing
a
few
more
steps
the
couple
halted
and
remained
standing
in
front
of
the
building
It
is
like
this
Anna
Sergievna
continued
You
and
I
have
blundered
into
an
error
That
is
to
say
while
neither
of
us
is
in
the
heyday
of
youth
I
so
least
of
the
two
and
both
of
us
have
lived
our
fives
and
are
weary
we
are
also
for
I
need
not
stand
on
ceremony
individuals
of
intellect
Consequently
though
at
first
we
interested
one
another
and
felt
our
mutual
curiosity
aroused
it
happened
that
subsequently
That
subsequently
I
grew
stale
in
your
eyes
hazarded
Bazarov
Oh
no
That
that
was
not
the
cause
of
the
situation
you
are
well
aware
But
whatever
the
cause
you
and
I
have
not
a
compelling
need
of
one
another
Therein
lies
the
point
In
other
words
both
of
us
have
in
us
how
shall
I
express
it
both
of
us
are
too
mutually
akin
We
were
slow
to
grasp
that
fact
Now
Arkady
Have
you
a
'compelling
need
of
him
put
in
Bazarov
For
shame
Evgenii
Vasilitch
You
yourself
have
averred
that
he
is
not
wholly
indifferent
to
me
and
I
too
have
long
suspected
that
he
cherishes
for
me
at
least
a
measure
of
admiration
As
we
are
on
the
subject
I
will
not
attempt
to
conceal
from
you
that
of
late
the
fact
that
I
am
old
enough
to
be
his
aunt
has
not
prevented
me
from
devoting
to
him
more
of
my
thoughts
than
I
used
to
do
In
his
fresh
young
sentimentality
there
is
a
certain
charm
The
term
'fascination
comes
handier
in
such
cases
said
Bazarov
in
the
deep
quiet
tone
which
with
him
always
signified
sarcasm
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
found
Arkady
secretive
yesterday
he
made
but
the
scantiest
of
references
either
to
you
or
your
sister
That
constitutes
an
important
symptom
Katia
and
he
are
brother
and
sister
to
one
another
said
Madame
Indeed
I
am
pleased
to
see
it
though
perhaps
I
ought
not
to
connive
at
so
much
familiarity
I
presume
that
the
element
speaking
in
you
is
the
sister
drawled
Bazarov
Of
course
But
need
we
stand
here
Let
us
move
on
We
hold
curious
conversations
do
we
not
Indeed
to
think
of
all
the
things
which
I
now
say
to
you
Yet
I
still
fear
you
a
little
even
though
I
trust
you
as
being
at
heart
a
good
man
I
am
far
from
good
and
you
only
call
me
so
because
I
have
lost
all
significance
in
your
eyes
Ill
boots
it
to
weave
chaplets
for
the
head
of
a
corpse
Evgenii
Vasilitch
we
can
not
always
command
ourselves
came
the
sound
of
Anna
Sergievna
's
next
words
but
the
next
moment
the
wind
soughed
the
leaves
rustled
and
the
rest
of
what
she
was
saying
was
carried
away
into
the
distance
Nothing
beyond
it
save
after
a
pause
You
are
free
are
you
not
on
the
part
of
Bazarov
could
be
distinguished
Then
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
died
away
and
once
more
complete
silence
reigned
Turning
to
Katia
Arkady
saw
that
she
was
sitting
as
before
but
with
her
head
more
bent
Katerina
Sergievna
he
said
tremulously
and
with
his
hands
clasped
I
shall
love
you
always
and
beyond
recall
nor
shall
I
ever
love
another
woman
This
is
what
I
have
been
trying
to
say
to
you
this
morning
in
the
hope
that
I
might
ascertain
your
views
and
then
beg
for
your
hand
I
am
not
a
rich
man
but
I
would
make
any
sacrifice
for
your
sake
Come
then
Will
you
answer
me
Will
you
trust
me
Surely
you
do
not
think
that
I
am
speaking
out
of
frivolity
Recall
the
past
few
days
may
you
not
rest
assured
now
that
my
remaining
self
you
know
what
I
mean
is
gone
for
ever
Come
look
at
me
look
at
me
and
speak
but
a
word
a
single
word
I
love
you
I
love
you
Do
not
refuse
to
believe
that
I
mean
what
I
say
Gravely
yet
with
a
radiant
look
in
her
eyes
Katia
raised
her
head
and
after
a
moment
's
thought
said
with
the
trace
of
a
smile
Yes
Arkady
leapt
up
'Yes
You
have
said
'Yes
Katia
But
what
do
mean
by
that
word
Do
you
mean
that
you
believe
in
my
love
or
do
you
mean
that
No
no
I
dare
not
finish
the
sentence
Katia
repeated
only
the
word
Yes
but
this
time
she
left
no
room
for
misunderstanding
Arkady
seized
her
large
but
not
unshapely
hands
in
his
and
panting
with
rapture
strained
her
to
his
breast
He
could
scarcely
stand
upon
his
feet
he
could
only
keep
repeating
again
and
again
Katia
Katia
Meanwhile
she
shed
a
few
innocent
tears
at
which
she
smiled
as
they
fell
The
man
who
has
not
seen
such
tears
in
the
eyes
of
his
beloved
does
not
know
the
height
of
happiness
to
which
with
mingled
joy
and
gratitude
and
modesty
a
woman
can
attain
Next
morning
Anna
Sergievna
sent
for
Bazarov
to
her
boudoir
and
when
he
arrived
she
with
a
forced
smile
handed
him
a
folded
sheet
of
notepaper
That
sheet
represented
a
letter
from
Arkady
a
letter
in
which
he
begged
for
her
sister
's
hand
Bazarov
skimmed
the
epistle
then
scarcely
could
forbear
venting
the
rancour
which
blazed
for
a
moment
in
his
breast
It
is
as
I
said
you
see
he
commented
Only
yesterday
you
were
telling
me
that
his
feeling
for
Katerina
Sergievna
was
that
of
a
brother
for
a
sister
And
what
are
you
going
to
do
What
would
you
advise
me
to
do
she
said
still
smiling
I
presume
he
also
was
smiling
although
he
was
feeling
as
wholly
out
of
spirits
as
little
inclined
towards
gaiety
as
she
was
I
presume
that
we
have
no
choice
but
to
bestow
our
blessing
upon
the
young
couple
In
every
respect
it
would
be
a
good
match
for
his
father
has
a
nice
little
property
Arkady
is
the
only
son
and
the
father
is
too
easy-going
to
be
likely
to
raise
any
difficulty
Madame
Odintsov
rose
and
paced
the
room
for
a
moment
or
two
her
face
alternately
flushing
and
turning
pale
So
that
is
what
you
think
she
said
Well
I
too
see
no
impediment
Indeed
the
affair
rejoices
me
both
for
Katia
's
sake
and
for
yes
for
his
But
first
I
must
await
his
father
's
consent
and
for
that
purpose
I
will
send
Arkady
himself
to
interview
Nikolai
Petrovitch
So
I
was
right
yesterday
was
I
not
I
was
right
when
I
said
that
you
and
I
are
become
elderly
How
did
I
fail
to
foresee
this
I
am
indeed
surprised
at
it
Again
she
smiled
but
in
the
very
act
of
smiting
turned
away
Our
young
folk
are
indeed
cunning
remarked
Bazarov
After
a
pause
he
added
Good-bye
now
I
hope
that
the
affair
may
develop
Well
From
a
distance
I
too
shall
rejoice
She
turned
and
faced
him
Need
you
really
go
she
asked
Why
not
stay
a
little
longer
Pray
stay
for
I
find
talking
to
you
a
stimulant
it
is
like
walking
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
at
first
one
is
afraid
then
one
gathers
courage
Do
not
go
I
thank
you
for
the
proposal
as
also
for
your
flattering
estimate
of
my
conversational
powers
said
Bazarov
Nevertheless
I
have
tarried
overlong
in
a
sphere
which
is
alien
to
my
personality
Only
for
a
while
can
flying
fish
support
themselves
in
the
air
Then
they
relapse
into
their
natural
element
Allow
me
to
flop
back
into
mine
Yet
a
bitter
laugh
was
twisting
his
pale
features
She
saw
it
and
felt
sorry
for
him
The
man
still
loves
me
was
her
thought
and
she
extended
a
sympathetic
hand
He
understood
her
however
No
no
he
exclaimed
as
he
withdrew
a
step
or
two
Though
poor
I
have
never
yet
accepted
aims
Good-bye
and
may
your
lot
always
be
happy
Yet
we
shall
meet
again
she
replied
with
an
involuntary
gesture
Of
that
I
am
certain
Anything
may
occur
in
this
world
he
remarked
then
bowed
and
was
gone
That
afternoon
he
said
to
Arkady
as
he
knelt
down
to
pack
his
trunk
I
hear
that
you
are
going
to
make
a
nest
for
yourself
And
why
should
you
not
It
is
an
excellent
course
to
take
But
for
you
to
dissemble
is
useless
and
I
had
scarcely
expected
that
you
would
do
so
Has
the
preoccupation
of
it
all
deprived
you
of
your
tongue
When
I
left
you
at
Marino
I
had
no
thought
of
this
said
Arkady
You
are
the
dissembler
though
are
you
not
For
when
you
say
'It
is
an
excellent
course
to
take
you
dissemble
as
well
as
waste
your
time
seeing
that
I
am
well
aware
of
your
views
on
marriage
Merely
my
way
of
expressing
myself
You
see
what
I
am
doing
at
this
moment
In
my
trunk
is
a
vacant
space
I
am
packing
it
with
straw
And
the
same
with
life
's
trunk
To
avoid
leaving
empty
spaces
therein
we
pad
the
interstices
You
need
not
be
offended
You
can
not
fail
to
remember
what
I
really
think
of
Katerina
Sergievna
While
some
maidens
earn
cheap
reputations
by
merely
smiling
at
right
moments
your
inamorata
can
show
more
indeed
so
much
more
that
soon
you
will
be
and
very
properly
under
her
thumb
Slapping
down
the
lid
of
the
trunk
Bazarov
rose
from
the
floor
Now
farewell
he
said
No
I
will
not
deceive
you
we
are
parting
for
ever
and
you
know
it
In
my
opinion
you
have
acted
wisely
for
you
were
not
meant
to
live
the
hard
bitter
reckless
life
of
Nihilism
you
lack
at
once
the
necessary
coolness
and
the
necessary
venom
But
this
is
not
to
say
that
in
you
there
is
not
a
due
measure
of
youthful
spirit
What
I
mean
is
that
that
asset
alone
is
not
sufficient
for
the
work
The
dvorianin
is
powerless
to
progress
beyond
either
well-bred
effervescence
or
well-bred
humility
and
both
sentiments
are
futile
For
example
you
have
not
yet
been
blooded
yet
already
you
think
yourself
a
man
whereas
the
two
chief
conditions
of
our
existence
are
battle
and
bloodshed
Yes
the
dust
from
our
heels
hurts
your
eyes
and
the
grime
on
our
bodies
makes
you
feel
dirty
In
other
words
although
you
derive
a
certain
gratification
from
indulging
in
self-criticism
and
think
no
small
beer
of
yourself
