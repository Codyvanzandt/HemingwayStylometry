I
asked
'with
whom
I
have
had
the
pleasure
He
raised
his
head
quickly
'No
for
mercy
's
sake
he
cut
me
short
'do
n't
inquire
my
name
either
of
me
or
of
others
Let
me
remain
to
you
an
unknown
being
crushed
by
fate
Vassily
Vassilyevitch
Besides
as
an
unoriginal
person
I
don't
deserve
an
individual
name
But
if
you
really
want
to
give
me
some
title
call
me
call
me
the
Hamlet
of
the
Shtchigri
district
There
are
many
such
Hamlets
in
every
district
but
perhaps
you
have
n't
come
across
others
After
which
good-bye
He
buried
himself
again
in
his
feather-bed
and
the
next
morning
when
they
came
to
wake
me
he
was
no
longer
in
the
room
He
had
left
before
daylight
TCHERTOP-HANOV
AND
NEDOPYUSKIN
One
hot
summer
day
I
was
coming
home
from
hunting
in
a
light
cart
Yermola
sat
beside
me
dozing
and
scratching
his
nose
The
sleeping
dogs
were
jolted
up
and
down
like
lifeless
bodies
under
our
feet
The
coachman
kept
flicking
gadflies
off
the
horses
with
his
whip
The
white
dust
rose
in
a
light
cloud
behind
the
cart
We
drove
in
between
bushes
The
road
here
was
full
of
ruts
and
the
wheels
began
catching
in
the
twigs
Yermola
started
up
and
looked
round
'Hullo
he
said
'there
ought
to
be
grouse
here
Let
's
get
out
We
stopped
and
went
into
the
thicket
My
dog
hit
upon
a
covey
I
took
a
shot
and
was
beginning
to
reload
when
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
crackling
behind
me
and
a
man
on
horseback
came
towards
me
pushing
the
bushes
apart
with
his
hands
'Sir
pe-ermit
me
to
ask
he
began
in
a
haughty
voice
'by
what
right
you
are
er
shooting
here
sir
The
stranger
spoke
extraordinarily
quickly
jerkily
and
condescendingly
I
looked
at
his
face
never
in
my
life
have
I
seen
anything
like
it
Picture
to
yourselves
gentle
readers
a
little
flaxen-haired
man
with
a
little
turn-up
red
nose
and
long
red
moustaches
A
pointed
Persian
cap
with
a
crimson
cloth
crown
covered
his
forehead
right
down
to
his
eyebrows
He
was
dressed
in
a
shabby
yellow
Caucasian
overcoat
with
black
velveteen
cartridge
pockets
on
the
breast
and
tarnish
silver
braid
on
all
the
seams
over
his
shoulder
was
slung
a
horn
in
his
sash
was
sticking
a
dagger
A
raw-boned
hook-nosed
chestnut
horse
shambled
unsteadily
under
his
weight
two
lean
crook-pawed
greyhounds
kept
turning
round
just
under
the
horse
's
legs
The
face
the
glance
the
voice
every
action
the
whole
being
of
the
stranger
was
expressive
of
a
wild
daring
and
an
unbounded
incredible
pride
his
pale-blue
glassy
eyes
strayed
about
with
a
sideway
squint
like
a
drunkard
's
he
flung
back
his
head
puffed
out
his
cheeks
snorted
and
quivered
all
over
as
though
bursting
with
dignity
for
all
the
world
like
a
turkey-cock
He
repeated
his
question
'I
did
n't
know
it
was
forbidden
to
shoot
here
I
replied
'You
are
here
sir
he
continued
'on
my
land
'With
your
permission
I
will
go
off
it
'But
pe-ermit
me
to
ask
he
rejoined
'is
it
a
nobleman
I
have
the
honour
of
addressing
I
mentioned
my
name
'In
that
case
oblige
me
by
hunting
here
I
am
a
nobleman
myself
and
am
very
pleased
to
do
any
service
to
a
nobleman
And
my
name
is
Panteley
Tchertop-hanov
He
bowed
hallooed
gave
his
horse
a
lash
on
the
neck
the
horse
shook
its
head
reared
shied
and
trampled
on
a
dog
's
paws
The
dog
gave
a
piercing
squeal
Tchertop-hanov
boiled
over
with
rage
foaming
at
the
mouth
he
struck
the
horse
with
his
fist
on
the
head
between
the
ears
leaped
to
the
ground
quicker
than
lightning
looked
at
the
dog
's
paw
spat
on
the
wound
gave
it
a
kick
in
the
ribs
to
stop
its
whining
caught
on
to
the
horse
's
forelock
and
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
The
horse
flung
up
its
head
and
with
its
tail
in
the
air
edged
away
into
the
bushes
he
followed
it
hopping
on
one
leg
he
got
into
the
saddle
at
last
however
flourished
his
whip
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
blew
his
horn
and
galloped
off
I
had
not
time
to
recover
from
the
unexpected
appearance
of
Tchertop-hanov
when
suddenly
almost
without
any
noise
there
came
out
of
the
bushes
a
stoutish
man
of
forty
on
a
little
black
nag
He
stopped
took
off
his
green
leather
cap
and
in
a
thin
subdued
voice
he
asked
me
whether
I
had
n't
seen
a
horseman
riding
a
chestnut
I
answered
that
I
had
'Which
way
did
the
gentleman
go
he
went
on
in
the
same
tone
without
putting
on
his
cap
'Over
there
'I
humbly
thank
you
sir
He
made
a
kissing
sound
with
his
lips
swung
his
legs
against
his
horse
's
sides
and
fell
into
a
jog-trot
in
the
direction
indicated
I
looked
after
him
till
his
peaked
cap
was
hidden
behind
the
branches
This
second
stranger
was
not
in
the
least
like
his
predecessor
in
exterior
His
face
plump
and
round
as
a
ball
expressed
bashfulness
good-nature
and
humble
meekness
his
nose
also
plump
and
round
and
streaked
with
blue
veins
betokened
a
sensualist
On
the
front
of
his
head
there
was
not
a
single
hair
left
some
thin
brown
tufts
stuck
out
behind
there
was
an
ingratiating
twinkle
in
his
little
eyes
set
in
long
slits
and
a
sweet
smile
on
his
red
juicy
lips
He
had
on
a
coat
with
a
stand-up
collar
and
brass
buttons
very
worn
but
clean
his
cloth
trousers
were
hitched
up
high
his
fat
calves
were
visible
above
the
yellow
tops
of
his
boots
'Who
's
that
I
inquired
of
Yermola
'That
Nedopyuskin
Tihon
Ivanitch
He
lives
at
Tchertop-hanov
's
'What
is
he
a
poor
man
'He
's
not
rich
but
to
be
sure
Tchertop-hanov
's
not
got
a
brass
farthing
either
'Then
why
does
he
live
with
him
'Oh
they
made
friends
One
's
never
seen
without
the
other
It
's
a
fact
indeed
where
the
horse
puts
its
hoof
there
the
crab
sticks
its
claw
We
got
out
of
the
bushes
suddenly
two
hounds
'gave
tongue
close
to
us
and
a
big
hare
bounded
through
the
oats
which
were
fairly
high
by
now
The
dogs
hounds
and
harriers
leaped
out
of
the
thicket
after
him
and
after
the
dogs
flew
out
Tchertop-hanov
himself
He
did
not
shout
nor
urge
the
dogs
on
nor
halloo
he
was
breathless
and
gasping
broken
senseless
sounds
were
jerked
out
of
his
gaping
mouth
now
and
then
he
dashed
on
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
and
furiously
lashed
at
his
luckless
horse
with
the
whip
The
harriers
were
gaining
on
the
hare
it
squatted
for
a
moment
doubled
sharply
back
and
darted
past
Yermola
into
the
bushes
The
harriers
rushed
in
pursuit
'Lo-ok
out
lo-ok
out
the
exhausted
horseman
articulated
with
effort
in
a
sort
of
stutter
'lo-ok
out
friend
Yermola
shot
the
wounded
hare
rolled
head
over
heels
on
the
smooth
dry
grass
leaped
into
the
air
and
squealed
piteously
in
the
teeth
of
a
worrying
dog
The
hounds
crowded
about
her
Like
an
arrow
Tchertop-hanov
flew
off
his
horse
clutched
his
dagger
ran
straddling
among
the
dogs
with
furious
imprecations
snatched
the
mangled
hare
from
them
and
creasing
up
his
whole
face
he
buried
the
dagger
in
its
throat
up
to
the
very
hilt
buried
it
and
began
hallooing
Tihon
Ivanitch
made
his
appearance
on
the
edge
of
the
thicket
'Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
vociferated
Tchertop-hanov
a
second
time
'Ho-ho-ho-ho
his
companion
repeated
placidly
'But
really
you
know
one
ought
not
to
hunt
in
summer
'I
observed
to
Tchertop-hanov
pointing
to
the
trampled-down
oats
'It
's
my
field
answered
Tchertop-hanov
gasping
He
pulled
the
hare
into
shape
hung
it
on
to
his
saddle
and
flung
the
paws
among
the
dogs
'I
owe
you
a
charge
my
friend
by
the
rules
of
hunting
he
said
addressing
Yermola
'And
you
dear
sir
he
added
in
the
same
jerky
abrupt
voice
'my
thanks
He
mounted
his
horse
'Pe-ermit
me
to
ask
I
've
forgotten
your
name
and
your
father
's
Again
I
told
him
my
name
'Delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
When
you
have
an
opportunity
hope
you
'll
come
and
see
me
But
where
is
that
Fomka
Tihon
Ivanitch
he
went
on
with
heat
'the
hare
was
run
down
without
him
'His
horse
fell
down
under
him
replied
Tihon
Ivanitch
with
a
smile
'Fell
down
Orbassan
fell
down
Pugh
tut
Where
is
he
'Over
there
behind
the
copse
Tchertop-hanov
struck
his
horse
on
the
muzzle
with
his
whip
and
galloped
off
at
a
breakneck
pace
Tihon
Ivanitch
bowed
to
me
twice
once
for
himself
and
once
for
his
companion
and
again
set
off
at
a
trot
into
the
bushes
These
two
gentlemen
aroused
my
curiosity
keenly
What
could
unite
two
creatures
so
different
in
the
bonds
of
an
inseparable
friendship
I
began
to
make
inquiries
This
was
what
I
learned
Panteley
Eremyitch
Tchertop-hanov
had
the
reputation
in
the
whole
surrounding
vicinity
of
a
dangerous
crack-brained
fellow
haughty
and
quarrelsome
in
the
extreme
He
had
served
a
very
short
time
in
the
army
and
had
retired
from
the
service
through
'difficulties
with
his
superiors
with
that
rank
which
is
generally
regarded
as
equivalent
to
no
rank
at
all
He
came
of
an
old
family
once
rich
his
forefathers
lived
sumptuously
after
the
manner
of
the
steppes
that
is
they
welcomed
all
invited
or
uninvited
fed
them
to
exhaustion
gave
out
oats
by
the
quarter
to
their
guests
coachmen
for
their
teams
kept
musicians
singers
jesters
and
dogs
on
festive
days
regaled
their
people
with
spirits
and
beer
drove
to
Moscow
in
the
winter
with
their
own
horses
in
heavy
old
coaches
and
sometimes
were
for
whole
months
without
a
farthing
living
on
home-grown
produce
The
estate
came
into
Panteley
Eremyitch
's
father
's
hands
in
a
crippled
condition
he
in
his
turn
'played
ducks
and
drakes
with
it
and
when
he
died
left
his
sole
heir
Panteley
the
small
mortgaged
village
of
Bezsonovo
with
thirty-five
souls
of
the
male
and
seventy-six
of
the
female
sex
and
twenty-eight
acres
and
a
half
of
useless
land
on
the
waste
of
Kolobrodova
no
record
of
serfs
for
which
could
be
found
among
the
deceased
's
deeds
The
deceased
had
it
must
be
confessed
ruined
himself
in
a
very
strange
way
'provident
management
had
been
his
destruction
According
to
his
notions
a
nobleman
ought
not
to
depend
on
merchants
townsmen
and
'brigands
of
that
sort
as
he
called
them
he
set
up
all
possible
trades
and
crafts
on
his
estate
'it
's
both
seemlier
and
cheaper
he
used
to
say
'it
's
provident
management
He
never
relinquished
this
fatal
idea
to
the
end
of
his
days
indeed
it
was
his
ruin
But
then
what
entertainment
it
gave
him
He
never
denied
himself
the
satisfaction
of
a
single
whim
Among
other
freaks
he
once
began
building
after
his
own
fancy
so
immense
a
family
coach
that
in
spite
of
the
united
efforts
of
the
peasants
horses
drawn
together
from
the
whole
village
as
well
as
their
owners
it
came
to
grief
and
fell
to
pieces
on
the
first
hillside
Eremey
Lukitch
the
name
of
Panteley's
father
was
Eremey
Lukitch
ordered
a
memorial
to
be
put
up
on
the
hillside
but
was
not
however
at
all
abashed
over
the
affair
He
conceived
the
happy
thought
too
of
building
a
church
by
himself
of
course
without
the
assistance
of
an
architect
He
burnt
a
whole
forest
in
making
the
bricks
laid
an
immense
foundation
as
though
for
a
provincial
hall
raised
the
walls
and
began
putting
on
the
cupola
the
cupola
fell
down
He
tried
again
the
cupola
again
broke
down
he
tried
the
third
time
the
cupola
fell
to
pieces
a
third
time
Good
Eremey
Lukitch
grew
thoughtful
there
was
something
uncanny
about
it
he
reflected
some
accursed
witchcraft
must
have
a
hand
in
it
and
at
once
he
gave
orders
to
flog
all
the
old
women
in
the
village
They
flogged
the
old
women
but
they
did
n't
get
the
cupola
on
for
all
that
He
began
reconstructing
the
peasants
huts
on
a
new
plan
and
all
on
a
system
of
'provident
management
he
set
them
three
homesteads
together
in
a
triangle
and
in
the
middle
stuck
up
a
post
with
a
painted
bird-cage
and
flag
Every
day
he
invented
some
new
freak
at
one
time
he
was
making
soup
of
burdocks
at
another
cutting
his
horses
tails
off
to
make
caps
for
his
servants
at
another
proposing
to
substitute
nettles
for
flax
to
feed
pigs
on
mushrooms
He
had
once
read
in
the
Moscow
Gazette
an
article
by
a
Harkov
landowner
Hryak-Hrupyorsky
on
the
importance
of
morality
to
the
well-being
of
the
peasant
and
the
next
day
he
gave
forth
a
decree
to
all
his
peasants
to
learn
off
the
Harkov
landowner
's
article
by
heart
at
once
The
peasants
learnt
the
article
the
master
asked
them
whether
they
understood
what
was
said
in
it
The
bailiff
replied
that
to
be
sure
they
understood
it
About
the
same
time
he
ordered
all
his
subjects
with
a
view
to
the
maintenance
of
order
and
provident
management
to
be
numbered
and
each
to
have
his
number
sewn
on
his
collar
On
meeting
the
master
each
was
to
shout
'Number
so-and-so
is
here
and
the
master
would
answer
affably
'Go
on
in
God
's
name
In
spite
however
of
order
and
provident
management
Eremey
Lukitch
got
by
degrees
into
a
very
difficult
position
he
began
at
first
by
mortgaging
his
villages
and
then
was
brought
to
the
sale
of
them
the
last
ancestral
home
the
village
with
the
unfinished
church
was
sold
at
last
for
arrears
to
the
Crown
luckily
not
in
the
lifetime
of
Eremey
Lukitch
he
could
never
have
supported
such
a
blow
but
a
fortnight
after
his
death
He
succeeded
in
dying
at
home
in
his
own
bed
surrounded
by
his
own
people
and
under
the
care
of
his
own
doctor
but
nothing
was
left
to
poor
Panteley
but
Bezsonovo
Panteley
heard
of
his
father
's
illness
while
he
was
still
in
the
service
in
the
very
heat
of
the
'difficulties
mentioned
above
He
was
only
just
nineteen
From
his
earliest
childhood
he
had
not
left
his
father
's
house
and
under
the
guidance
of
his
mother
a
very
good-natured
but
perfectly
stupid
woman
Vassilissa
Vassilyevna
he
grew
up
spoilt
and
conceited
She
undertook
his
education
alone
Eremey
Lukitch
buried
in
his
economical
fancies
had
no
thoughts
to
spare
for
it
It
is
true
he
once
punished
his
son
with
his
own
hand
for
mispronouncing
a
letter
of
the
alphabet
but
Eremey
Lukitch
had
received
a
cruel
and
secret
blow
that
day
his
best
dog
had
been
crushed
by
a
tree
Vassilissa
Vassilyevna
's
efforts
in
regard
Panteley
's
education
did
not
however
get
beyond
one
terrific
exertion
in
the
sweat
of
her
brow
she
engaged
him
a
tutor
one
Birkopf
a
retired
Alsatian
soldier
and
to
the
day
of
her
death
she
trembled
like
a
leaf
before
him
'Oh
she
thought
'if
he
throws
us
up
I
'm
lost
Where
could
I
turn
Where
could
I
find
another
teacher
Why
with
what
pains
what
pains
I
enticed
this
one
away
from
our
neighbours
And
Birkopf
like
a
shrewd
man
promptly
took
advantage
of
his
unique
position
he
drank
like
a
fish
and
slept
from
morning
till
night
On
the
completion
of
his
'course
of
science
Panteley
entered
the
army
Vassilissa
Vassilyevna
was
no
more
she
had
died
six
months
before
that
important
event
of
fright
She
had
had
a
dream
of
a
white
figure
riding
on
a
bear
Eremey
Lukitch
soon
followed
his
better
half
At
the
first
news
of
his
illness
Panteley
galloped
home
at
breakneck
speed
but
he
did
not
find
his
father
alive
What
was
the
amazement
of
the
dutiful
son
when
he
found
himself
utterly
unexpectedly
transformed
from
a
rich
heir
to
a
poor
man
Few
men
are
capable
of
bearing
so
sharp
a
reverse
well
Panteley
was
embittered
made
misanthropical
by
it
From
an
honest
generous
good-natured
fellow
though
spoilt
and
hot-tempered
he
became
haughty
and
quarrelsome
he
gave
up
associating
with
the
neighbours
he
was
too
proud
to
visit
the
rich
and
he
disdained
the
poor
and
behaved
with
unheard
of
arrogance
to
everyone
even
to
the
established
authorities
'I
am
of
the
ancient
hereditary
nobility
he
would
say
Once
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
shooting
the
police-commissioner
for
coming
into
the
room
with
his
cap
on
his
head
Of
course
the
authorities
on
their
side
had
their
revenge
and
took
every
opportunity
to
make
him
feel
their
power
but
still
they
were
rather
afraid
of
him
because
he
had
a
desperate
temper
and
would
propose
a
duel
with
knives
at
the
second
word
At
the
slightest
retort
Tchertop-hanov
's
eyes
blazed
his
voice
broke
Ah
er
er
er
he
stammered
'damn
my
soul
and
nothing
could
stop
him
And
moreover
he
was
a
man
of
stainless
character
who
had
never
had
a
hand
in
anything
the
least
shady
No
one
of
course
visited
him
and
with
all
this
he
was
a
good-hearted
even
a
great-hearted
man
in
his
own
way
acts
of
injustice
of
oppression
he
would
not
brook
even
against
strangers
he
stood
up
for
his
own
peasants
like
a
rock
'What
he
would
say
with
a
violent
blow
on
his
own
head
'touch
my
people
mine
My
name
's
not
Tchertop-hanov
if
I
Tihon
Ivanitch
Nedopyuskin
could
not
like
Panteley
Eremyitch
pride
himself
on
his
origin
His
father
came
of
the
peasant
proprietor
class
and
only
after
forty
years
of
service
attained
the
rank
of
a
noble
Mr
Nedopyuskin
the
father
belonged
to
the
number
of
those
people
who
are
pursued
by
misfortune
with
an
obduracy
akin
to
personal
hatred
For
sixty
whole
years
from
his
very
birth
to
his
very
death
the
poor
man
was
struggling
with
all
the
hardships
calamities
and
privations
incidental
to
people
of
small
means
he
struggled
like
a
fish
under
the
ice
never
having
enough
food
and
sleep
cringing
worrying
wearing
himself
to
exhaustion
fretting
over
every
farthing
with
genuine
'innocence
suffering
in
the
service
and
dying
at
last
in
either
a
garret
or
a
cellar
in
the
unsuccessful
struggle
to
gain
for
himself
or
his
children
a
crust
of
dry
bread
Fate
had
hunted
him
down
like
a
hare
He
was
a
good-natured
and
honest
man
though
he
did
take
bribes
from
a
threepenny
bit
up
to
a
crown
piece
inclusive
Nedopyuskin
had
a
wife
thin
and
consumptive
he
had
children
too
luckily
they
all
died
young
except
Tihon
and
a
daughter
Mitrodora
nicknamed
'the
merchants
belle
who
after
many
painful
and
ludicrous
adventures
was
married
to
a
retired
attorney
Mr
Nedopyuskin
had
succeeded
before
his
death
in
getting
Tihon
a
place
as
supernumerary
clerk
in
some
office
but
directly
after
his
father
's
death
Tihon
resigned
his
situation
Their
perpetual
anxieties
their
heartrending
struggle
with
cold
and
hunger
his
mother
's
careworn
depression
his
father
's
toiling
despair
the
coarse
aggressiveness
of
landladies
and
shopkeepers
all
the
unending
daily
suffering
of
their
life
had
developed
an
exaggerated
timidity
in
Tihon
at
the
mere
sight
of
his
chief
he
was
faint
and
trembling
like
a
captured
bird
He
threw
up
his
office
Nature
in
her
indifference
or
perhaps
her
irony
implants
in
people
all
sorts
of
faculties
and
tendencies
utterly
inconsistent
with
their
means
and
their
position
in
society
with
her
characteristic
care
and
love
she
had
moulded
of
Tihon
the
son
of
a
poor
clerk
a
sensuous
indolent
soft
impressionable
creature
a
creature
fitted
exclusively
for
enjoyment
gifted
with
an
excessively
delicate
sense
of
smell
and
of
taste
she
had
moulded
him
finished
him
off
most
carefully
and
set
her
creation
to
struggle
up
on
sour
cabbage
and
putrid
fish
And
behold
the
creation
did
struggle
up
somehow
and
began
what
is
called
'life
Then
the
fun
began
Fate
which
had
so
ruthlessly
tormented
Nedopyuskin
the
father
took
to
the
son
too
she
had
a
taste
for
them
one
must
suppose
But
she
treated
Tihon
on
a
different
plan
she
did
not
torture
him
she
played
with
him
She
did
not
once
drive
him
to
desperation
she
did
not
set
him
to
suffer
the
degrading
agonies
of
hunger
but
she
led
him
a
dance
through
the
whole
of
Russia
from
one
end
to
the
other
from
one
degrading
and
ludicrous
position
to
another
at
one
time
Fate
made
him
'majordomo
to
a
snappish
choleric
Lady
Bountiful
at
another
a
humble
parasite
on
a
wealthy
skinflint
merchant
then
a
private
secretary
to
a
goggle-eyed
gentleman
with
his
hair
cut
in
the
English
style
then
she
promoted
him
to
the
post
of
something
between
butler
and
buffoon
to
a
dog-fancier
In
short
Fate
drove
poor
Tihon
to
drink
drop
by
drop
to
the
dregs
the
bitter
poisoned
cup
of
a
dependent
existence
He
had
been
in
his
time
the
sport
of
the
dull
malignity
and
the
boorish
pranks
of
slothful
masters
How
often
alone
in
his
room
released
at
last
'to
go
in
peace
after
a
mob
of
visitors
had
glutted
their
taste
for
horseplay
at
his
expense
he
had
vowed
blushing
with
shame
chill
tears
of
despair
in
his
eyes
that
he
would
run
away
in
secret
would
try
his
luck
in
the
town
would
find
himself
some
little
place
as
clerk
or
die
once
for
all
of
hunger
in
the
street
But
in
the
first
place
God
had
not
given
him
strength
of
character
secondly
his
timidity
unhinged
him
and
thirdly
how
could
he
get
himself
a
place
whom
could
he
ask
'They
'll
never
give
it
me
the
luckless
wretch
would
murmur
tossing
wearily
in
his
bed
'they
'll
never
give
it
me
And
the
next
day
he
would
take
up
the
same
degrading
life
again
His
position
was
the
more
painful
that
with
all
her
care
nature
had
not
troubled
to
give
him
the
smallest
share
of
the
gifts
and
qualifications
without
which
the
trade
of
a
buffoon
is
almost
impossible
He
was
not
equal
for
instance
to
dancing
till
he
dropped
in
a
bearskin
coat
turned
inside
out
nor
making
jokes
and
cutting
capers
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
cracking
whips
if
he
was
turned
out
in
a
state
of
nature
into
a
temperature
of
twenty
degrees
below
freezing
as
often
as
not
he
caught
cold
his
stomach
could
not
digest
brandy
mixed
with
ink
and
other
filth
nor
minced
funguses
and
toadstools
in
vinegar
There
is
no
knowing
what
would
have
become
of
Tihon
if
the
last
of
his
patrons
a
contractor
who
had
made
his
fortune
had
not
taken
it
into
his
head
in
a
merry
hour
to
inscribe
in
his
will
'And
to
Zyozo
Tihon
to
wit
Nedopyuskin
I
leave
in
perpetual
possession
to
him
and
his
heirs
the
village
of
Bezselendyevka
lawfully
acquired
by
me
with
all
its
appurtenances
A
few
days
later
this
patron
was
taken
with
a
fit
of
apoplexy
after
gorging
on
sturgeon
soup
A
great
commotion
followed
the
officials
came
and
put
seals
on
the
property
The
relations
arrived
the
will
was
opened
and
read
and
they
called
for
Nedopyuskin
Nedopyuskin
made
his
appearance
The
greater
number
of
the
party
knew
the
nature
of
Tihon
Ivanitch
's
duties
in
his
patron's
household
he
was
greeted
with
deafening
shouts
and
ironical
congratulations
'The
landowner
here
is
the
new
owner
shouted
the
other
heirs
'Well
really
this
put
in
one
a
noted
wit
and
humourist
'well
really
this
one
may
say
this
positively
is
really
what
one
may
call
an
heir-apparent
and
they
all
went
off
into
shrieks
For
a
long
while
Nedopyuskin
could
not
believe
in
his
good
fortune
They
showed
him
the
will
he
flushed
shut
his
eyes
and
with
a
despairing
gesture
he
burst
into
tears
The
chuckles
of
the
party
passed
into
a
deep
unanimous
roar
The
village
of
Bezselendyevka
consisted
of
only
twenty-two
serfs
no
one
regretted
its
loss
keenly
so
why
not
get
some
fun
out
of
it
One
of
the
heirs
from
Petersburg
an
important
man
with
a
Greek
nose
and
a
majestic
expression
of
face
Rostislav
Adamitch
Shtoppel
went
so
far
as
to
go
up
to
Nedopyuskin
and
look
haughtily
at
him
over
his
shoulder
'So
far
as
I
can
gather
honoured
sir
he
observed
with
contemptuous
carelessness
'you
enjoyed
your
position
in
the
household
of
our
respected
Fedor
Fedoritch
owing
to
your
obliging
readiness
to
wait
on
his
diversions
The
gentleman
from
Petersburg
expressed
himself
in
a
style
insufferably
refined
smart
and
correct
Nedopyuskin
in
his
agitation
and
confusion
had
not
taken
in
the
unknown
gentleman
's
words
but
the
others
were
all
quiet
at
once
the
wit
smiled
condescendingly
Mr
Shtoppel
rubbed
his
hands
and
repeated
his
question
Nedopyuskin
raised
his
eyes
in
bewilderment
and
opened
his
mouth
Rostislav
Adamitch
puckered
his
face
up
sarcastically
'I
congratulate
you
my
dear
sir
I
congratulate
you
he
went
on
'it's
true
one
may
say
not
everyone
would
have
consented
to
gain
his
daily
bread
in
such
a
fashion
but
de
guslibus
non
est
disputandum
that
is
everyone
to
his
taste
Eh
Someone
at
the
back
uttered
a
rapid
decorous
shriek
of
admiration
and
delight
'Tell
us
pursued
Mr
Shtoppel
much
encouraged
by
the
smiles
of
the
whole
party
'to
what
special
talent
are
you
indebted
for
your
good-fortune
No
do
n't
be
bashful
tell
us
we
're
all
here
so
to
speak
en
famille
Are
n't
we
gentlemen
all
here
en
famille
The
relation
to
whom
Rostislav
Adamitch
chanced
to
turn
with
this
question
did
not
unfortunately
know
French
and
so
he
confined
himself
to
a
faint
grunt
of
approbation
But
another
relation
a
young
man
with
patches
of
a
yellow
colour
on
his
forehead
hastened
to
chime
in
'Wee
wee
to
be
sure
'Perhaps
Mr
Shtoppel
began
again
'you
can
walk
on
your
hands
your
legs
raised
so
to
say
in
the
air
Nedopyuskin
looked
round
in
agony
every
face
wore
a
taunting
smile
every
eye
was
moist
with
delight
'Or
perhaps
you
can
crow
like
a
cock
A
loud
guffaw
broke
out
on
all
sides
and
was
hushed
at
once
stifled
by
expectation
'Or
perhaps
on
your
nose
you
can
'Stop
that
a
loud
harsh
voice
suddenly
interrupted
Rostislav
Adamitch
'I
wonder
you
're
not
ashamed
to
torment
the
poor
man
Everyone
looked
round
In
the
doorway
stood
Tchertop-hanov
As
a
cousin
four
times
removed
of
the
deceased
contractor
he
too
had
received
a
note
of
invitation
to
the
meeting
of
the
relations
During
the
whole
time
of
reading
the
will
he
had
kept
as
he
always
did
haughtily
apart
from
the
others
'Stop
that
he
repeated
throwing
his
head
back
proudly
Mr
Shtoppel
turned
round
quickly
and
seeing
a
poorly
dressed
unattractive-looking
man
he
inquired
of
his
neighbour
in
an
undertone
caution
's
always
a
good
thing
'Who
's
that
'Tchertop-hanov
he
's
no
great
shakes
the
latter
whispered
in
his
ear
Rostislav
Adamitch
assumed
a
haughty
air
'And
who
are
you
to
give
orders
he
said
through
his
nose
drooping
his
eyelids
scornfully
'who
may
you
be
allow
me
to
inquire
a
queer
fish
upon
my
word
Tchertop-hanov
exploded
like
gunpowder
at
a
spark
He
was
choked
with
fury
'Ss
ss
ss
he
hissed
like
one
possessed
and
all
at
once
he
thundered
'Who
am
I
Who
am
I
I
'm
Panteley
Tchertop-hanov
of
the
ancient
hereditary
nobility
my
forefathers
served
the
Tsar
and
who
may
you
be
Rostislav
Adamitch
turned
pale
and
stepped
back
He
had
not
expected
such
resistance
'I
I
a
fish
indeed
Tchertop-hanov
darted
forward
Shtoppel
bounded
away
in
great
perturbation
the
others
rushed
to
meet
the
exasperated
nobleman
'A
duel
a
duel
a
duel
at
once
across
a
handkerchief
shouted
the
enraged
Panteley
'or
beg
my
pardon
yes
and
his
too
'Pray
beg
his
pardon
the
agitated
relations
muttered
all
round
Shtoppel
'he
's
such
a
madman
he
'd
cut
your
throat
in
a
minute
'I
beg
your
pardon
I
beg
your
pardon
I
did
n't
know
stammered
Shtoppel
'I
did
n't
know
'And
beg
his
too
vociferated
the
implacable
Panteley
'I
beg
your
pardon
too
added
Rostislav
Adamitch
addressing
Nedopyuskin
who
was
shaking
as
if
he
were
in
an
ague
Tchertop-hanov
calmed
down
he
went
up
to
Tihon
Ivanitch
took
him
by
the
hand
looked
fiercely
round
and
as
not
one
pair
of
eyes
ventured
to
meet
his
he
walked
triumphantly
amid
profound
silence
out
of
the
room
with
the
new
owner
of
the
lawfully
acquired
village
of
Bezselendyevka
From
that
day
they
never
parted
again
The
village
of
Bezselendyevka
was
only
seven
miles
from
Bezsonovo
The
boundless
gratitude
of
Nedopyuskin
soon
passed
into
the
most
adoring
veneration
The
weak
soft
and
not
perfectly
stainless
Tihon
bowed
down
in
the
dust
before
the
fearless
and
irreproachable
Panteley
'It
's
no
slight
thing
he
thought
to
himself
sometimes
'to
talk
to
the
governor
look
him
straight
in
the
face
Christ
have
mercy
on
us
does
n't
he
look
at
him
He
marvelled
at
him
he
exhausted
all
the
force
of
his
soul
in
his
admiration
of
him
he
regarded
him
as
an
extraordinary
man
as
clever
as
learned
And
there
's
no
denying
that
bad
as
Tchertop-hanov's
education
might
be
still
in
comparison
with
Tihon
's
education
it
might
pass
for
brilliant
Tchertop-hanov
it
is
true
had
read
little
Russian
and
knew
French
very
badly
so
badly
that
once
in
reply
to
the
question
of
a
Swiss
tutor
'_Vous
parlez
fran
ais
monsieur
he
answered
'_Je
ne
comprehend
and
after
a
moment
's
thought
he
added
pa
but
any
way
he
was
aware
that
Voltaire
had
once
existed
and
was
a
very
witty
writer
and
that
Frederick
the
Great
king
of
Prussia
had
been
distinguished
as
a
great
military
commander
Of
Russian
writers
he
respected
