at
all
said
Madame
Kukshin
I
am
merely
standing
up
for
the
rights
of
women
rights
which
I
have
sworn
to
defend
to
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
A
bas
began
Sitnikov
then
paused
I
do
not
reject
them
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
But
you
do
reject
them
for
you
are
a
Slavophil
as
I
can
see
very
clearly
On
the
contrary
I
am
not
a
Slavophil
although
of
course
I
But
you
are
a
Slavophil
you
believe
in
the
principles
of
the
Domostroi

and
would
like
always
to
be
holding
over
women
a
scourge
A
scourge
is
not
a
bad
thing
in
its
proper
place
observed
Bazarov
But
seeing
that
we
have
reached
the
last
drop
of
of
Of
what
said
Evdoksia
Of

most
respected
Avdotia
Nikitishna
not
of
your
blood
Never
when
I
hear
my
sex
abused
can
I
listen
with
indifference
resumed
Evdoksia
It
is
all
too
horrible
too
horrible
Instead
of
attacking
us
people
ought
to
read
Michel
's

De
l'Amour
What
a
wonderful
work
it
is
Let
us
talk
of
love
She
posed
her
arm
gracefully
upon
the
tumbled
cushions
of
the
sofa
There
fell
a
sudden
silence
What
is
there
to
say
concerning
love
at
length
said
Bazarov
In
passing
you
mentioned
a
certain
Madame
Odintsov
I
think
that
was
the
name
Who
is
she
A
very
charming
woman
squeaked
Sitnikov
as
well
as
clever
rich
and
a
widow
Unfortunately
she
is
not
sufficiently
developed
and
a
closer
acquaintance
with
our
Evdoksia
would
do
her
a
world
of
good
Evdoksia
I

to
your
health

us

Victor
The
luncheon
proved
a
lengthy
affair
for
to
the
first
bottle
of
champagne
there
succeeded
a
second
and
to
the
latter
a
third
and
to
that
a
fourth
Meanwhile
Evdoksia
kept
up
an
unceasing
flow
of
chatter
and
received
effective
assistance
from
Sitnikov
In
particular
did
the
pair
discuss
the
nature
of
marriage
the
outcome
of
prejudice
and
vice
the
question
whether
people
are
born
single
and
the
consistency
of
individuality
Then
Evdoksia
seated
herself
at
the
piano
and
red
in
the
face
with
wine
which
she
had
drunk
clattered
her
flat
finger-nails
upon
the
keys
and
essayed
hoarsely
to
sing
first
of
all
some
gipsy
ditties
and
then
the
ballad
Dreaming
Granada
lies
asleep
while
throwing
a
scarf
over
his
head
to
represent
the
dying
lover
Sitnikov
joined
her
at
the
words
Your
lips
meet
mine
in
a
burning
kiss
At
length
Arkady
could
stand
it
no
longer
Gentlemen
he
exclaimed
this
is
sheer
Bedlam
As
for
Bazarov
he
yawned
for
he
had
done
little
more
than
interject
a
satirical
word
or
two
his
attention
had
been
devoted
rather
to
the
champagne
At
length
he
rose
and
accompanied
by
Arkady
left
the
house
without
so
much
as
a
word
of
farewell
to
the
hostess
Sitnikov
pursued
the
pair
Ah
ha
he
exclaimed
as
he
skipped
about
the
roadway
Did
I
not
tell
you
that
she
would
prove
a
most
remarkable
personality
Would
that
more
of
our
women
were
like
her
In
her
way
she
is
a
moral
phenomenon
And
your
father
's
establishment
remarked
Bazarov
as
he
pointed
to
a
tavern
which
they
happened
to
be
passing
Is
that
also
a
moral
phenomenon
Sitnikov
vented
another
of
his
shrill
giggles
But
being
also
ashamed
of
his
origin
he
felt
at
a
loss
whether
to
plume
himself
upon
or
to
take
offence
at
Bazarov
's
unexpected
pleasantry

Louise
Michel
1830-1906
a
French
anarchist
long
resident
in
London
A
few
days
later
the
ball
was
held
at
the
Governor
's
and
Matvei
Ilyitch
figured
thereat
as
the
guest
of
honour
For
his
part
the
President
of
the
Provincial
Council
who
was
at
loggerheads
with
the
Governor
explained
at
large
that
only
out
of
respect
for
Matvei
had
he
deigned
to
be
present
while
the
Governor
continued
even
when
stationary
his
usual
process
of
orders-giving
With
Matvei
's
suavity
of
demeanour
nothing
could
be
compared
save
his
pomposity
Upon
every
man
he
smiled
upon
some
with
a
hint
of
superciliousness
upon
others
with
a
shade
of
deference
whilst
to
the
ladies
he
bowed
and
scraped
en
vrai
chevalier
français
and
laughed
throughout
the
great
resonant
conspicuous
laugh
which
a
bigwig
ought
to
do
Again
he
clapped
Arkady
upon
the
back
addressed
him
loudly
as
young
nephew
and
honoured
Bazarov
who
had
been
with
difficulty
coaxed
into
an
ancient
tail-coat
both
with
a
distant
yet
faintly
condescending
glance
which
skimmed
that
individual
's
cheek
and
with
a
vague
but
affable
murmur
in
which
there
could
be
distinguished
only
the
fragments
I
Yes
and
'xtremely
Lastly
he
accorded
Sitnikov
a
finger
and
a
smile
in
the
very
act
turning
his
head
away
and
bestowed
upon
Madame
Kukshin
who
had
appeared
minus
a
crinoline
and
in
dirty
gloves
but
with
a
bird
of
paradise
stuck
in
her
hair
an
Enchanté
The
throng
present
was
immense
nor
was
a
sufficiency
of
cavaliers
lacking
True
most
of
the
civilian
element
crowded
against
the
walls
but
the
military
section
danced
with
enthusiasm
especially
an
officer
who
being
fresh
from
six
weeks
in
Paris
where
he
had
become
acquainted
with
daring
cries
of
the
type
of
Zut
Ah
fichtrrre
Pst
pst
mon
bibi
and
so
forth
pronounced
these
quips
to
perfection
with
true
Parisian
chic
while
also
he
said
Si
j'aurais
for
Si
j'avais
and
absolument
in
the
sense
of
certainly
In
short
he
employed
that
Franco-Russian
jargon
which
affords
the
French
such
intense
amusement
whenever
they
do
not
think
it
more
prudent
to
assure
their
Russian
friends
that
the
latter
speak
the
tongue
of
France
comme
des
anges
As
we
know
Arkady
was
a
poor
dancer
and
Bazarov
did
not
dance
at
all
wherefore
the
pair
sought
a
corner
and
were
there
joined
by
Sitnikov
Summoning
to
his
visage
his
accustomed
smile
of
contempt
and
emitting
remarks
mordantly
sarcastic
in
their
nature
the
great
Sitnikov
glanced
haughtily
about
him
and
appeared
to
derive
some
genuine
pleasure
from
thus
striking
an
attitude
But
suddenly
his
face
underwent
a
change
Turning
to
Arkady
he
said
in
a
self-conscious
way
Here
is
Madame
Odintsov
just
entering
Looking
up
Arkady
beheld
halted
in
the
doorway
a
tall
woman
in
a
black
gown
In
particular
was
he
struck
with
the
dignity
of
her
carriage
and
with
the
manner
in
which
her
bare
arms
hung
beside
her
upright
figure
From
her
gleaming
hair
to
her
sloping
shoulders
trailed
sprays
of
fuchsia
flowers
while
quietly
intelligently
I
say
quietly
not
dreamily
there
gazed
with
a
barely
perceptible
smile
from
under
a
white
and
slightly
prominent
forehead
a
pair
of
brilliant
eyes
In
general
the
countenance
suggested
latent
but
gentle
kindly
force
Do
you
know
her
Arkady
inquired
I
do
intimately
replied
Sitnikov
Shall
I
introduce
you
If
you
please
but
only
when
this
quadrille
has
come
to
an
end
Bazarov
's
attention
also
had
been
caught
by
this
Madame
Odintsov
What
a
face
he
exclaimed
No
other
woman
in
the
room
has
one
anything
like
it
As
soon
therefore
as
the
quadrille
was
over
Sitnikov
conducted
Arkady
to
Madame
Odintsov
and
though
at
first
whether
through
the
excessive
intimacy
of
Sitnikov
's
acquaintance
or
whether
through
the
fact
that
he
happened
to
stumble
over
his
words
she
gazed
at
him
with
a
shade
of
astonishment
she
no
sooner
heard
Arkady
's
family
name
than
her
face
brightened
and
she
inquired
whether
he
was
the
son
of
Nikolai
Petrovitch
I
am
replied
Arkady
Then
I
have
twice
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
your
father
Also
I
have
heard
much
about
him
and
shall
be
most
glad
to
know
you
At
this
point
an
aide-de-camp
sidled
up
and
requested
the
honour
of
a
quadrille
which
request
she
granted
Then
you
dance
exclaimed
Arkady
but
with
great
deference
I
do
What
made
you
think
that
I
do
not
Is
it
that
I
look
too
old
Oh
no
pardon
me
By
no
means
Then
perhaps
I
too
might
ask
for
a
mazurka
Smiling
indulgently
she
replied
If
you
wish
and
then
looked
at
him
not
so
much
in
a
superior
manner
as
in
that
of
a
married
sister
who
is
regarding
a
very
very
young
brother
Though
she
was
not
greatly
older
than
Arkady
she
had
just
attained
her
twenty-ninth
year
her
presence
made
him
feel
the
veriest
schoolboy
and
caused
the
difference
of
years
to
seem
infinitely
greater
than
it
was
Next
Matvei
Ilyitch
approached
her
with
a
majestic
air
and
a
few
obsequious
words
whereupon
Arkady
moved
away
a
little
while
continuing
to
observe
her
In
fact
not
until
the
quadrille
was
over
did
he
find
himself
able
to
withdraw
his
eyes
from
her
bewitching
person
Throughout
her
conversation
with
her
partner
and
the
guest
of
honour
was
accompanied
with
small
movements
of
the
head
and
eyes
and
twice
she
uttered
a
low
laugh
True
her
nose
erred
a
little
on
the
side
of
thickness
as
do
those
of
most
Russian
women
nor
was
the
colour
of
her
skin
unimpeachable
yet
Arkady
came
to
the
conclusion
that
never
in
his
life
had
he
encountered
a
woman
so
charming
of
personality
Continuously
the
sound
of
her
voice
murmured
in
his
ears
and
the
very
folds
of
her
dress
looked
different
from
those
of
other
women
they
seemed
to
hang
straighter
and
more
symmetrically
and
her
every
movement
was
smooth
and
natural
Nevertheless
when
the
strains
of
the
mazurka
struck
up
and
reseating
himself
beside
his
partner
he
prepared
to
enter
into
conversation
with
her
he
felt
a
distinct
touch
of
diffidence
Nor
though
he
kept
passing
his
hand
over
his
hair
could
he
find
a
word
to
say
However
this
timidity
this
state
of
agitation
did
not
last
long
for
soon
her
calmness
infected
him
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
talking
to
her
of
his
father
his
uncle
and
life
in
St
Petersburg
and
the
country
For
her
part
she
listened
with
kindly
interest
while
gently
opening
and
closing
her
fan
Thus
only
at
moments
when
other
cavaliers
came
to
ask
her
for
dances
Sitnikov
did
this
twice
did
Arkady's
chatter
become
interrupted
and
whenever
she
returned
to
her
place
to
reseat
herself
with
her
bosom
heaving
not
a
whit
more
rapidly
than
it
had
done
before
he
would
plunge
into
renewed
conversation
so
delighted
was
he
at
the
fact
that
he
had
found
some
one
to
sympathise
with
him
to
whom
he
could
talk
at
whose
beautiful
eyes
and
forehead
and
gentle
refined
intellectual
features
he
could
gaze
at
leisure
She
herself
said
little
but
her
every
word
showed
a
knowledge
of
life
which
pointed
to
the
fact
that
already
this
young
woman
had
thought
and
felt
much
Who
was
the
man
with
you
before
Sitnikov
brought
you
to
me
she
inquired
So
you
noticed
my
friend
exclaimed
Arkady
Has
he
not
a
splendid
face
His
name
is
Bazarov
And
once
launched
upon
the
subject
Arkady
descanted
so
fully
and
with
such
enthusiasm
that
Madame
Odintsov
turned
to
observe
his
friend
more
closely
But
soon
the
mazurka
began
to
draw
to
a
close
and
Arkady
found
himself
regretting
the
prospect
of
losing
the
companion
with
whom
he
had
spent
such
a
pleasant
hour
True
he
had
felt
throughout
that
he
was
being
treated
with
condescension
and
ought
to
be
grateful
but
upon
young
hearts
such
an
obligation
does
not
press
with
any
great
weight
The
music
stopped
with
a
jerk
Merci
said
Madame
Odintsov
then
rose
You
have
promised
to
come
and
see
me
Also
bring
with
you
your
friend
for
I
am
filled
with
curiosity
to
behold
a
man
who
has
the
temerity
to
believe
in
nothing
Next
the
Governor
approached
Madame
with
a
distraught
air
and
an
intimation
that
supper
was
ready
whereupon
she
took
his
proffered
arm
and
as
she
departed
turned
with
a
last
smile
and
nod
to
Arkady
who
in
answer
bowed
and
stood
following
her
with
his
eyes
How
straight
her
figure
looked
under
the
sheen
of
her
black
gown
Already
she
will
have
forgotten
my
existence
he
thought
to
himself
while
an
exquisite
humility
pervaded
his
soul
Then
he
rejoined
Bazarov
in
their
joint
corner
Well
his
friend
said
Have
you
enjoyed
yourself
Some
man
or
other
has
just
been
telling
me
that
the
lady
in
question
is
But
in
all
probability
the
man
was
a
fool
What
do
you
think
of
her
The
allusion
escapes
me
replied
Arkady
Come
come
young
innocence
Or
at
all
events
your
informant
's
meaning
escapes
me
Madame
is
nice
but
as
cold
and
formal
as
as
As
a
stagnant
pool
concluded
Bazarov
Yes
we
all
know
the
sort
of
thing
You
say
that
she
is
cold
but
that
is
purely
a
matter
of
taste
Perhaps
you
yourself
like
ice
Perhaps
I
do
the
other
muttered
But
of
such
things
I
am
no
judge
and
in
any
case
she
wishes
to
make
your
acquaintance
as
well
as
mine
and
has
asked
me
to
bring
you
with
me
to
call
The
description
of
me
which
you
gave
is
easily
imagined
On
the
other
hand
you
did
rightly
to
offer
her
us
both
for
no
matter
who
she
may
be
whether
a
provincial
lioness
or
only
an
'_émancipée_
like
the
Kukshin
woman
she
has
at
least
such
a
pair
of
shoulders
as
I
have
not
seen
this
many
a
day
Arkady
recoiled
from
this
cynicism
yet
as
often
happens
in
such
cases
started
to
reproach
his
friend
for
something
wholly
unconnected
with
the
utterance
which
had
given
umbrage
Why
do
you
refuse
women
freedom
of
thought
he
asked
under
his
breath
For
the
reason
dear
sir
that
according
to
my
observation
of
life
no
woman
unless
she
be
a
freak
thinks
with
freedom
And
here
the
conversation
terminated
for
supper
had
come
to
an
end
and
the
friends
departed
As
they
left
the
room
Madame
Kukshin
followed
them
with
a
nervous
and
wrathful
yet
slightly
apprehensive
smile
in
her
eyes
The
reason
of
this
was
that
she
felt
wounded
in
her
conceit
at
the
fact
that
neither
of
the
young
men
had
taken
any
notice
of
her
Nevertheless
she
remained
at
the
ball
until
most
of
the
rest
of
the
company
had
left
whereafter
it
being
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
she
danced
a
polka-mazurka
à
la
Parisienne
with
Sitnikov
and
with
this
edifying
spectacle
brought
the
Governor
's
fête
to
a
close
Now
let
us
see
to
what
category
of
mortals
to
assign
this
young
person
said
Bazarov
to
Arkady
as
on
the
following
day
the
pair
mounted
the
staircase
of
the
hotel
where
Madame
Odintsov
was
staying
Somehow
I
seem
to
scent
impropriety
in
the
air
You
surprise
me
burst
forth
Arkady
Do
you
Bazarov
do
you
hold
with
the
narrow-minded
morality
which
Idiot
exclaimed
Bazarov
contemptuously
Do
you
not
know
that
both
in
our
jargon
and
in
the
understanding
of
the
ordinary
person
the
term
'improper
has
now
come
to
mean
the
same
as
'proper
In
any
case
I
seem
to
scent
money
here
You
yourself
told
me
did
you
not
that
Madame
's
marriage
was
a
very
strange
one
though
for
my
part
I
look
upon
marrying
a
rich
old
man
as
anything
but
a
strange
proceeding
rather
as
a
measure
of
prudence
True
I
place
little
reliance
upon
the
gossip
of
townsfolk
but
at
least
I
prefer
to
suppose
that
that
gossip
has
as
our
cultured
Governor
would
say
'a
basis
in
fact
Arkady
did
not
respond
but
knocked
at
the
door
of
Madame
's
suite
and
the
door
having
been
opened
a
liveried
man-servant
ushered
the
visitors
into
a
large
hideously
furnished
room
of
the
type
which
is
always
to
be
found
in
Russian
hotels
the
only
exception
in
the
present
case
being
that
the
apartment
was
adorned
with
flowers
Presently
Madame
herself
entered
clad
in
a
plain
morning
gown
and
looking
even
younger
in
the
spring
sunlight
than
she
had
done
in
the
ballroom
Arkady
duly
presented
Bazarov
and
as
he
did
so
remarked
with
surprise
that
his
friend
seemed
confused
while
Madame
was
as
imperturbable
as
ever
This
gaucherie
on
his
part
Bazarov
realised
and
felt
vexed
at
Phaugh
he
thought
to
himself
The
idea
that
I
should
be
afraid
of
a
woman
Yet
like
Sitnikov
he
could
only
subside
into
a
chair
and
fall
to
talking
with
an
exaggerated
emphasis
to
the
woman
who
sat
with
her
brilliant
eyes
riveted
with
such
attention
upon
him
Anna
Sergievna
Odintsov
had
had
for
father
one
Sergei
Nikolaievitch
Loktev
a
well-known
gambler
speculator
and
beau
After
fifteen
years
of
flaunting
it
in
St
Petersburg
and
Moscow
and
dissipating
his
whole
substance
he
had
been
forced
to
retire
to
the
country
where
soon
afterwards
he
had
died
and
left
to
his
daughter
Anna
aged
twenty
and
his
daughter
Katerina
aged
twelve
only
a
small
joint
competence
As
for
the
girls
mother
who
had
come
of
the
impoverished
house
of
the
Princes
X
she
had
expired
during
the
heyday
of
her
husband's
career
in
St
Petersburg
Anna
's
position
after
her
father
's
death
was
therefore
a
very
difficult
one
for
the
brilliant
education
which
she
had
received
in
the
capital
had
in
no
way
fitted
her
for
the
care
of
a
household
and
an
estate
nor
yet
for
the
endurance
of
a
life
in
the
country
Moreover
she
possessed
not
a
single
acquaintance
in
that
country
neighbourhood
nor
any
one
to
whom
to
turn
for
advice
since
her
father
had
done
his
best
to
avoid
associating
with
his
neighbours
in
that
he
had
despised
them
as
much
as
they
in
their
several
ways
had
despised
him
Howbeit
Anna
kept
her
head
and
straightway
sent
for
her
mother
's
sister
the
Princess
Avdotia
Stepanovna
X
who
a
malicious
presuming
old
woman
annexed
on
the
day
of
her
arrival
all
the
best
rooms
in
the
house
raged
and
stormed
from
morning
till
night
and
even
declined
to
walk
in
the
garden
unless
she
could
be
accompanied
by
her
only
serf
a
sullen-looking
lacquey
who
wore
a
faded
green
livery
a
blue
collar
and
a
three-cornered
hat
Nevertheless
Anna
put
up
with
these
tantrums
of
her
aunt
's
superintended
the
education
of
her
sister
and
resigned
herself
to
the
idea
of
living
in
seclusion
for
the
rest
of
her
life
But
fate
had
ordained
otherwise
That
is
to
say
a
certain
Odintsov
a
rich
bloated
unwieldy
soured
semi-imbecile
hypochondriac
of
forty-six
who
was
nevertheless
neither
stupid
nor
cruel
happened
to
see
her
and
became
so
enamoured
that
he
offered
her
marriage
and
to
this
proposal
she
consented
For
six
years
the
pair
lived
together
before
the
husband
died
leaving
her
all
his
property
The
following
year
she
spent
in
the
country
after
which
she
went
abroad
with
her
sister
but
only
as
far
as
Germany
since
she
quickly
wearied
of
foreign
parts
and
was
only
too
thankful
to
return
to
her
beloved
Nikolsköe
which
lay
some
forty
versts
from
the
provincial
town
of
At
Nikolsköe
she
had
at
her
disposal
a
splendid
tastefully
furnished
mansion
a
beautiful
garden
and
a
range
of
orangeries
the
late
Odintsov
having
denied
himself
in
nothing
but
inasmuch
as
she
made
but
rare
appearances
in
the
town
and
then
only
on
flying
visits
connected
with
business
the
provincial
gentry
conceived
a
grudge
against
her
and
took
to
gossiping
of
her
marriage
with
Odintsov
and
relating
such
impossible
tales
as
that
she
had
assisted
her
father
in
his
nefarious
schemes
that
she
had
had
her
reasons
for
going
abroad
and
that
certain
unfortunate
results
of
that
tour
had
had
to
be
concealed
I
tell
you
the
ardent
retailer
of
such
fables
would
say
that
she
has
been
through
the
mill
right
enough
Eventually
these
rumours
reached
her
ears
but
she
ignored
them
altogether
since
her
nature
was
at
once
bold
and
independent
Seating
herself
at
full
length
in
an
armchair
and
crossing
one
hand
over
the
other
she
set
herself
to
listen
to
Bazarov
's
harangue
Contrary
to
his
usual
custom
he
spoke
without
restraint
for
he
was
clearly
anxious
to
interest
his
listener
Arkady
again
felt
surprised
at
this
though
he
failed
to
detect
whether
or
not
Bazarov
was
succeeding
in
his
aim
seeing
that
Anna
Sergievna
's
face
gave
no
clue
to
the
effect
produced
so
fixedly
did
her
features
retain
their
faintly
polite
expression
so
unvaryingly
did
her
beautiful
eyes
reflect
unruffled
attention
True
at
first
Bazarov
's
vehemence
gave
her
an
unpleasant
impression
as
of
a
bad
smell
or
a
jarring
note
but
in
time
she
began
to
understand
that
it
came
of
his
being
ill
at
ease
and
she
felt
flattered
at
the
fact
Only
the
paltry
repelled
her
and
no
one
could
well
have
accused
Bazarov
of
that
quality
Indeed
wonders
were
never
to
cease
for
Arkady
since
though
he
had
expected
Bazarov
to
talk
to
Madame
Odintsov
as
to
a
woman
of
intellect
to
speak
to
her
of
his
views
and
convictions
seeing
that
she
had
expressed
a
desire
to
behold
a
man
who
had
the
temerity
to
believe
in
nothing
he
discoursed
only
on
medicine
homoeopathy
and
botany
At
the
same
time
Madame
had
not
wasted
her
life
of
solitude
but
had
read
a
large
number
of
standard
works
and
could
express
herself
in
the
best
of
Russian
and
though
at
one
point
she
diverted
the
conversation
to
music
she
no
sooner
perceived
that
he
declined
to
recognise
the
existence
of
the
art
than
she
returned
to
botany
even
though
Arkady
would
gladly
have
continued
the
discussion
of
the
importance
of
national
melodies
In
passing
her
treatment
of
Arkady
as
a
younger
brother
remained
the
same
What
she
valued
in
him
was
evidently
the
good
humour
and
simplicity
of
youth
nothing
more
Thus
there
was
held
for
three
hours
an
animated
but
intermittent
discursive
conversation
At
length
the
friends
rose
to
say
farewell
With
a
kindly
glance
Anna
Sergievna
offered
them
her
beautiful
white
hand
then
after
a
moment's
reflection
said
irresolutely
but
with
a
pleasant
smile
If
neither
of
you
fear
finding
the
time
tedious
will
you
come
and
pay
me
a
visit
at
Nikolsköe
I
should
deem
it
the
greatest
pleasure
cried
Arkady
And
you
Monsieur
Bazarov
Bazarov
merely
bowed
which
again
surprised
Arkady
while
also
he
noticed
that
his
friend
's
face
looked
flushed
Well
the
younger
man
said
as
the
pair
issued
into
the
street
Are
you
still
of
the
opinion
that
she
is
is
I
can
not
say
But
what
an
icicle
she
has
made
of
herself
There
was
a
pause
At
all
events
she
is
an
imposing
personage
a
grande
dame
who
lacks
but
a
train
to
her
gown
and
a
coronet
to
her
head
But
none
of
our
grandes
dames
speak
Russian
as
she
does
remarked
Arkady
No
for
she
has
undergone
a
rebirth
and
eaten
of
our
bread
And
what
a
charm
is
hers
You
mean
what
a
splendid
body
the
very
thing
for
a
dissecting
theatre
Stop
stop
for
God
's
sake
Her
body
differs
from
all
other
women
's
No
need
to
lose
your
temper
young
innocent
Have
I
not
said
that
she
stands
in
the
front
rank
of
women
Yes
we
must
pay
her
that
visit
When
The
day
after
to-morrow
Nothing
else
is
to
be
done
here
for
we
need
not
stay
to
drink
champagne
with
the
Kukshin
woman
and
listen
to
the
harangues
of
your
kinsman
the
Liberal
bigwig
Not
we
The
day
after
to-morrow
therefore
let
us
give
the
whole
thing
the
go-by
A
propos
my
father
's
place
lies
near
Nikolsköe
For
Nikolsköe
is
on
the
road
is
it
not
It
is
Optime
Then
we
shall
gain
nothing
by
delay
only
fools
and
clever
people
procrastinate
Her
anatomy
I
repeat
is
splendid
Within
three
days
in
bright
but
not
too
warm
weather
the
two
friends
were
bowling
along
the
road
to
Nikolsköe
With
a
will
did
the
well-fed
stage
horses
trot
out
and
lightly
swish
their
flanks
with
their
plaited
knotted
tails
and
as
Arkady
glanced
along
the
road
he
for
some
unknown
reason
smiled
Congratulate
me
cried
Bazarov
of
a
sudden
To-day
is
the
22nd
of
June
the
feast
of
my
Patron
Saint
Certainly
he
looks
after
me
does
he
not
Then
the
speaker
added
in
a
lower
tone
But
to-day
also
they
are
expecting
me
at
home
Well
let
them
expect
me
The
manor-house
in
which
Anna
Sergievna
resided
stood
on
an
open
hillock
and
close
to
a
yellow
stone
church
with
a
green
roof
white
columns
and
an
entrance
surmounted
by
a
fresco
representative
of
Our
Lord
's
Resurrection
the
latter
executed
in
the
Italian
style
and
having
as
its
most
noticeable
feature
the
figure
of
a
swarthy
warrior
whose
rounded
contours
filled
the
entire
foreground
Behind
the
church
the
village
extended
into
two
long
wings
and
had
thatched
roofs
surmounted
by
a
medley
of
chimneys
while
the
manor-house
itself
was
built
in
a
style
homogeneous
with
the
design
of
the
church
that
is
to
say
in
the
style
commonly
known
as
Alexandrine
and
embracing
yellow-painted
walls
a
green
roof
white
columns
and
a
front
adorned
with
a
coat-of-arms
In
fact
both
buildings
had
been
erected
by
a
provincial
architect
to
the
order
of
the
late
Odintsov
a
man
impatient
so
he
himself
always
expressed
it
of
vain
and
arbitrary
innovations
Lastly
to
right
and
left
of
the
house
there
showed
the
trees
of
an
antique
garden
while
an
avenue
of
clipped
firs
led
the
way
to
the
principal
entrance
The
friends
having
been
met
in
the
hall
by
two
strapping
lacqueys
in
livery
one
of
the
latter
immediately
ran
for
the
butler
who
a
stout
man
in
a
black
tail-coat
proceeded
to
usher
the
guests
up
a
carpeted
staircase
and
into
a
room
which
contained
a
couple
of
beds
and
the
usual
appurtenances
of
the
toilet
Evidently
neatness
was
the
order
of
the
day
in
the
establishment
for
everything
was
both
spotlessly
clean
and
as
fragrant
as
the
chamber
wherein
a
Minister
of
State
holds
his
receptions
Anna
Sergievna
will
be
glad
to
see
you
in
half
an
hour
the
butler
said
Meanwhile
have
you
any
orders
for
me
No
worthy
one
replied
Bazarov
Except
that
you
might
so
far
condescend
as
to
bring
me
a
small
glassful
of
vodka
It
shall
be
done
sir
said
the
butler
with
a
shade
of
hesitation
whereafter
he
departed
with
creaking
boots
What
grandeur
commented
Bazarov
In
your
opinion
how
ought
our
hostess
to
be
addressed
In
the
style
of
a
duchess
Yes
and
of
a
very
great
duchess
replied
Arkady
The
more
so
seeing
that
she
has
invited
such
influential
aristocrats
as
ourselves
to
visit
her
I
presume
that
you
are
referring
to
your
humble
servant
a
future
doctor
the
son
of
a
doctor
and
the
grandson
of
a
sexton
By
the
way
are
you
aware
that
my
grandparent
was
a
sexton
even
as
was
Speransky
's
1
A
smile
curled
his
lips
Thus
you
see
that
the
lady
is
mistaken
woefully
mistaken
We
have
n't
such
a
thing
as
a
tail-coat
have
we
Arkady
shrugged
his
shoulders
bravely
but
he
too
was
feeling
a
little
awe-stricken
At
the
close
of
the
half-hour
the
pair
entered
the
drawing-room
which
they
found
to
be
a
large
lofty
apartment
of
rich
but
tasteless
appointments
Against
the
walls
in
the
usual
affected
style
stood
heavy
expensive
furniture
the
walls
themselves
were
hung
with
brown
curtains
to
which
were
florid
gilt
borders
all
these
things
the
late
Odintsov
had
ordered
through
a
Muscovite
friend
who
kept
a
wineshop
and
above
a
divan
in
the
centre
of
the
room
hung
a
portrait
of
a
wrinkled
sandy-haired
individual
who
seemed
to
be
regarding
the
newcomers
with
extreme
distaste
He
whispered
Bazarov
The
hostess
herself
then
entered
She
was
clad
in
a
light
dress
and
had
her
hair
dressed
behind
the
ears
a
style
which
communicated
to
her
pure
fresh
countenance
an
air
of
almost
girlish
juvenility
Thank
you
for
having
kept
your
promise
she
said
And
now
that
you
are
come
I
think
that
you
will
find
the
time
not
altogether
dull
For
one
thing
I
intend
to
introduce
you
to
my
sister
who
is
a
skilful
piano-player
of
course
Monsieur
Bazarov
to
you
such
things
are
a
matter
of
indifference
but
you
Monsieur
Kirsanov
I
know
adore
the
art
of
music
Also
an
elderly
aunt
lives
with
me
as
my
companion
and
at
intervals
a
neighbour
looks
in
for
a
game
of
cards
You
see
our
home
circle
Now
let
us
seat
ourselves
Madame
delivered
this
little
speech
with
the
precision
of
a
lesson
which
she
had
learnt
by
heart
and
then
turned
to
converse
with
Arkady
On
finding
that
her
mother
had
known
his
and
that
the
latter
had
made
the
former
her
confidant
during
her
love
affair
with
Nikolai
Petrovitch
the
lad
fell
to
speaking
enthusiastically
of
his
dead
parent
while
Bazarov
applied
himself
to
the
inspection
of
some
albums
What
a
domesticated
individual
I
am
thought
he
to
himself
Presently
with
much
pattering
of
paws
there
burst
into
the
room
a
splendid
Russian
greyhound
with
a
blue
collar
and
it
was
followed
by
a
young
girl
of
eighteen
with
a
dark
complexion
dark
hair
a
round
but
pleasant
face
and
small
dark
eyes
She
was
carrying
a
basket
of
flowers
My
sister
Katia
said
Madame
Odintsov
indicating
the
girl
with
her
head
