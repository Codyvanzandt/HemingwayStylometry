sleep
but
he
sank
into
the
drowsy
numbness
of
a
journey
Images
of
the
past
rose
slowly
as
before
floated
in
his
soul
mixed
and
tangled
up
with
other
fancies
Lavretsky
for
some
unknown
reason
began
to
think
about
Robert
Peel
about
French
history
of
how
he
would
gain
a
battle
if
he
were
a
general
he
fancied
the
shots
and
the
cries
His
head
slipped
on
one
side
he
opened
his
eyes
The
same
fields
the
same
steppe
scenery
the
polished
shoes
of
the
trace-horses
flashed
alternately
through
the
driving
dust
the
coachman
s
shirt
yellow
with
red
gussets
was
puffed
out
by
the
wind
A
nice
home-coming
glanced
through
Lavretsky
s
brain
and
he
cried
Get
on
wrapped
himself
in
his
cloak
and
pressed
close
into
the
cushion
The
carriage
jolted
Lavretsky
sat
up
and
opened
his
eyes
wide
On
the
slope
before
him
stretched
a
small
hamlet
a
little
to
the
right
could
be
seen
an
ancient
manor
house
of
small
size
with
closed
shutters
and
a
winding
flight
of
steps
nettles
green
and
thick
as
hemp
grew
over
the
wide
courtyard
from
the
very
gates
in
it
stood
a
storehouse
built
of
oak
still
strong
This
was
Vassilyevskoe
The
coachman
drove
to
the
gates
and
drew
up
Lavretsky
s
groom
stood
up
on
the
box
and
as
though
in
preparation
for
jumping
down
shouted
Hey
There
was
a
sleepy
muffled
sound
of
barking
but
not
even
a
dog
made
its
appearance
the
groom
again
made
ready
for
a
jump
and
again
shouted
Hey
The
feeble
barking
was
repeated
and
an
instant
after
a
man
from
some
unseen
quarter
ran
into
the
courtyard
dressed
in
a
nankeen
coat
his
head
as
white
as
snow
he
stared
at
the
coach
shading
his
eyes
from
the
sun
all
at
once
he
slapped
his
thighs
with
both
hands
ran
to
and
fro
a
little
then
rushed
to
open
the
gates
The
coach
drove
into
the
yard
crushing
the
nettles
with
the
wheels
and
drew
up
at
the
steps
The
white-headed
man
who
seemed
very
alert
was
already
standing
on
the
bottom
step
his
legs
bent
and
wide
apart
he
unfastened
the
apron
of
the
carriage
holding
back
the
strap
with
a
jerk
and
aiding
his
master
to
alight
he
kissed
his
hand
How
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
brother
began
Lavretsky
Your
name
s
Anton
I
think
You
are
still
alive
then
The
old
man
bowed
without
speaking
and
ran
off
for
the
keys
While
he
went
the
coachman
sat
motionless
sitting
sideways
and
staring
at
the
closed
door
but
Lavretsky
s
groom
stood
as
he
had
leaped
down
in
a
picturesque
pose
with
one
arm
thrown
back
on
the
box
The
old
man
brought
the
keys
and
quite
needlessly
twisting
about
like
a
snake
with
his
elbows
raised
high
he
opened
the
door
stood
on
one
side
and
again
bowed
to
the
earth
So
here
I
am
at
home
here
I
am
back
again
thought
Lavretsky
as
he
walked
into
the
diminutive
passage
while
one
after
another
the
shutters
were
being
opened
with
much
creaking
and
knocking
and
the
light
of
day
poured
into
the
deserted
rooms
The
small
manor-house
to
which
Lavretsky
had
come
and
in
which
two
years
before
Glafira
Petrovna
had
breathed
her
last
had
been
built
in
the
preceding
century
of
solid
pine-wood
it
looked
ancient
but
it
was
still
strong
enough
to
stand
another
fifty
years
or
more
Lavretsky
made
the
tour
of
all
the
rooms
and
to
the
great
discomfiture
of
the
aged
languid
flies
settled
under
the
lintels
and
covered
with
white
dust
he
ordered
the
windows
to
be
opened
everywhere
they
had
not
been
opened
ever
since
the
death
of
Glafira
Petrovna
Everything
in
the
house
had
remained
as
it
was
the
thin-legged
white
miniature
couches
in
the
drawing-room
covered
with
glossy
grey
stuff
threadbare
and
rickety
vividly
suggested
the
days
of
Catherine
in
the
drawing-room
too
stood
the
mistress
s
favourite
arm-chair
with
high
straight
back
against
which
she
never
leaned
even
in
her
old
age
On
the
principal
wall
hung
a
very
old
portrait
of
Fedor
s
great-grandfather
Andrey
Lavretsky
the
dark
yellow
face
was
scarcely
distinguishable
from
the
warped
and
blackened
background
the
small
cruel
eyes
looked
grimly
out
from
beneath
the
eyelids
which
dropped
as
if
they
were
swollen
his
black
unpowdered
hair
rose
bristling
above
his
heavy
indented
brow
In
the
corner
of
the
portrait
hung
a
wreath
of
dusty
immortelles
Glafira
Petrovna
herself
was
pleased
to
make
it
Anton
announced
In
the
bedroom
stood
a
narrow
bedstead
under
a
canopy
of
old-fashioned
and
very
good
striped
material
a
heap
of
faded
cushions
and
a
thin
quilted
counterpane
lay
on
the
bed
and
at
the
head
hung
a
picture
of
the
Presentation
in
the
Temple
of
the
Holy
Mother
of
God
it
was
the
very
picture
which
the
old
maid
dying
alone
and
forgotten
by
every
one
had
for
the
last
time
pressed
to
her
chilling
lips
A
little
toilet
table
of
inlaid
wood
with
brass
fittings
and
a
warped
looking-glass
in
a
tarnished
frame
stood
in
the
window
Next
to
the
bedroom
was
the
little
ikon
room
with
bare
walls
and
a
heavy
case
of
holy
images
in
the
corner
on
the
floor
lay
a
threadbare
rug
spotted
with
wax
Glafira
Petrovna
used
to
pray
bowing
to
the
ground
upon
it
Anton
went
away
with
Lavretsky
s
groom
to
unlock
the
stable
and
coach-house
to
replace
him
appeared
an
old
woman
of
about
the
same
age
with
a
handkerchief
tied
round
to
her
very
eyebrows
her
head
shook
and
her
eyes
were
dim
but
they
expressed
zeal
the
habit
of
years
of
submissive
service
and
at
the
same
time
a
kind
of
respectful
commiseration
She
kissed
Lavretsky
s
hand
and
stood
still
in
the
doorway
awaiting
his
orders
He
positively
could
not
recollect
her
name
and
did
not
even
remember
whether
he
had
ever
seen
her
Her
name
it
appeared
was
Apraxya
forty
years
before
Glafira
Petrovna
had
put
her
out
of
the
master
s
house
and
ordered
that
she
should
be
a
poultry
woman
She
said
little
however
she
seemed
to
have
lost
her
senses
from
old
age
and
could
only
gaze
at
him
obsequiously
Besides
these
two
old
creatures
and
three
pot-bellied
children
in
long
smocks
Anton
s
great-grandchildren
there
was
also
living
in
the
manor-house
a
one-armed
peasant
who
was
exempted
from
servitude
he
muttered
like
a
woodcock
and
was
of
no
use
for
anything
Not
much
more
useful
was
the
decrepit
dog
who
had
saluted
Lavretsky
s
return
by
its
barking
he
had
been
for
ten
years
fastened
up
by
a
heavy
chain
purchased
at
Glafira
Petrovna
s
command
and
was
scarcely
able
to
move
and
drag
the
weight
of
it
Having
looked
over
the
house
Lavretsky
went
into
the
garden
and
was
very
much
pleased
with
it
It
was
all
overgrown
with
high
grass
and
burdock
and
gooseberry
and
raspberry
bushes
but
there
was
plenty
of
shade
and
many
old
lime-trees
which
were
remarkable
for
their
immense
size
and
the
peculiar
growth
of
their
branches
they
had
been
planted
too
close
and
at
some
time
or
other
a
hundred
years
before
they
had
been
lopped
At
the
end
of
the
garden
was
a
small
clear
pool
bordered
with
high
reddish
rushes
The
traces
of
human
life
very
quickly
pass
away
Glafira
Petrovna
s
estate
had
not
had
time
to
become
quite
wild
but
already
it
seemed
plunged
in
that
quiet
slumber
in
which
everything
reposes
on
earth
where
there
is
not
the
infection
of
man
s
restlessness
Fedor
Ivanitch
walked
also
through
the
village
the
peasant-women
stared
at
him
from
the
doorways
of
their
huts
their
cheeks
resting
on
their
hands
the
peasants
saluted
him
from
a
distance
the
children
ran
out
and
the
dogs
barked
indifferently
At
last
he
began
to
feel
hungry
but
he
did
not
expect
his
servants
and
his
cook
till
the
evening
the
waggons
of
provisions
from
Lavriky
had
not
come
yet
and
he
had
to
have
recourse
to
Anton
Anton
arranged
matters
at
once
he
caught
killed
and
plucked
an
old
hen
Apraxya
gave
it
a
long
rubbing
and
cleaning
and
washed
it
like
linen
before
putting
it
into
the
stew-pan
when
at
last
it
was
cooked
Anton
laid
the
cloth
and
set
the
table
placing
beside
the
knife
and
fork
a
three-legged
salt-cellar
of
tarnished
plate
and
a
cut
decanter
with
a
round
glass
stopper
and
a
narrow
neck
then
he
announced
to
Lavretsky
in
a
sing-song
voice
that
the
meal
was
ready
and
took
his
stand
behind
his
chair
with
a
napkin
twisted
round
his
right
fights
and
diffusing
about
him
a
peculiar
strong
ancient
odour
like
the
scent
of
a
cypress-tree
Lavretsky
tried
the
soup
and
took
out
the
hen
its
skin
was
all
covered
with
large
blisters
a
tough
tendon
ran
up
each
leg
the
meat
had
a
flavour
of
wood
and
soda
When
he
had
finished
dinner
Lavretsky
said
that
he
would
drink
a
cup
of
tea
if
I
will
bring
it
this
minute
the
old
man
interrupted
And
he
kept
his
word
A
pinch
of
tea
was
hunted
up
twisted
in
a
screw
of
red
paper
a
small
but
very
fiery
and
loudly-hissing
samovar
was
found
and
sugar
too
in
small
lumps
which
looked
as
if
they
were
thawing
Lavretsky
drank
tea
out
of
a
large
cup
he
remembered
this
cup
from
childhood
there
were
playing-cards
depicted
upon
it
only
visitors
used
to
drink
out
of
it
and
here
was
he
drinking
out
if
like
a
visitor
In
the
evening
his
servants
came
Lavretsky
did
not
care
to
sleep
in
his
aunt
s
bed
he
directed
them
put
him
up
a
bed
in
the
dining-room
After
extinguishing
his
candle
he
stared
for
a
long
time
about
him
and
feel
into
cheerless
reflection
he
experienced
that
feeling
which
every
man
knows
whose
lot
it
is
to
pass
the
night
in
a
place
long
uninhabited
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
darkness
surrounding
him
on
all
sides
could
not
be
accustomed
to
the
new
inhabitant
the
very
walls
of
the
house
seemed
amazed
At
last
he
sighed
drew
up
the
counterpane
round
him
and
fell
asleep
Anton
remained
up
after
all
the
rest
of
the
household
he
was
whispering
a
long
while
with
Apraxya
he
sighed
in
an
undertone
and
twice
he
crossed
himself
they
had
neither
of
them
expected
that
their
master
would
settle
among
them
at
Vassilyevskoe
when
he
had
not
far
off
such
a
splendid
estate
with
such
a
capitally
built
house
they
did
not
suspect
that
the
very
house
was
hateful
to
Lavretsky
it
stirred
painful
memories
within
him
Having
gossiped
to
his
heart
s
content
Anton
took
a
stick
and
struck
the
night
watchman
s
board
which
had
hung
silent
for
so
many
years
and
laid
down
to
sleep
in
the
courtyard
with
no
covering
on
his
white
head
The
May
night
was
mild
and
soft
and
the
old
man
slept
sweetly
The
next
day
Lavretsky
got
up
rather
early
had
a
talk
with
the
village
bailiff
visited
the
threshing-floor
ordered
the
chain
to
be
taken
off
the
yard
dog
who
only
barked
a
little
but
did
not
even
come
out
of
his
kennel
and
returning
home
sank
into
a
kind
of
peaceful
torpor
which
he
did
not
shake
off
the
whole
day
Here
I
am
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
river
he
said
to
himself
more
than
once
He
sat
at
the
window
without
stirring
and
as
it
were
listened
to
the
current
of
the
quiet
life
surrounding
him
to
the
few
sounds
of
the
country
solitude
Something
from
behind
the
nettles
chirps
with
a
shrill
shrill
little
note
a
gnat
seems
to
answer
it
Now
it
has
ceased
but
still
the
gnat
keeps
up
its
sharp
whirr
across
the
pleasant
persistent
fretful
buzz
of
the
flies
sounds
the
hum
of
a
big
bee
constantly
knocking
its
head
against
the
ceiling
a
cock
crows
in
the
street
hoarsely
prolonging
the
last
note
there
is
the
rattle
of
a
cart
in
the
village
a
gate
is
creaking
Then
the
jarring
voice
of
a
peasant
woman
What
Hey
you
are
my
little
sweetheart
cries
Anton
to
the
little
two-year-old
girl
he
is
dandling
in
his
arms
Fetch
the
kvas
repeats
the
same
woman
s
voice
and
all
at
once
there
follows
a
deathly
silence
nothing
rattles
nothing
is
moving
the
wind
is
not
stirring
a
leaf
without
a
sound
the
swallows
fly
one
after
another
over
the
earth
and
sadness
weights
on
the
heart
from
their
noiseless
flight
Here
I
am
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
river
thought
Lavretsky
again
And
always
at
all
times
life
here
is
quiet
unhasting
he
thought
whoever
comes
within
its
circle
must
submit
here
there
is
nothing
to
agitate
nothing
to
harass
one
can
only
get
on
here
by
making
one
s
way
slowly
as
the
ploughman
cuts
the
furrow
with
his
plough
And
what
vigour
what
health
abound
in
this
inactive
place
Here
under
the
window
the
sturdy
burdock
creeps
out
of
the
thick
grass
above
it
the
lovage
trails
its
juicy
stalks
and
the
Virgin
s
tears
fling
still
higher
their
pink
tendrils
and
yonder
further
in
the
fields
is
the
silky
rye
and
the
oats
are
already
in
ear
and
every
leaf
on
every
tree
every
grass
on
its
stalk
is
spread
to
its
fullest
width
In
the
love
of
a
woman
my
best
years
have
gone
by
Lavretsky
went
on
thinking
let
me
be
sobered
by
the
sameness
of
life
here
let
me
be
soothed
and
made
ready
so
that
I
may
learn
to
do
my
duty
without
haste
And
again
he
fell
to
listening
to
the
silence
expecting
nothing
and
at
the
same
time
constantly
expecting
something
the
silence
enfolded
him
on
all
sides
the
sun
moved
calmly
in
the
peaceful
blue
sky
and
the
clouds
sailed
calmly
across
it
they
seemed
to
know
why
and
whither
they
were
sailing
At
this
same
time
in
other
places
on
the
earth
there
is
the
seething
the
bustle
the
clash
of
life
life
here
slipped
by
noiseless
as
water
over
marshy
grass
and
even
till
evening
Lavretsky
could
not
tear
himself
from
the
contemplation
of
this
life
as
it
passed
and
glided
by
sorrow
for
the
past
was
melting
in
his
soul
like
snow
in
spring
and
strange
to
say
never
had
the
feeling
of
home
been
so
deep
and
strong
within
him
In
the
course
of
a
fortnight
Fedor
Ivanitch
had
brought
Glafira
Petrovna
s
little
house
into
order
and
had
cleared
the
court-yard
and
the
garden
From
Lavriky
comfortable
furniture
was
sent
him
from
the
town
wine
books
and
papers
horses
made
their
appearance
in
the
stable
in
brief
Fedor
Ivanitch
provided
himself
with
everything
necessary
and
began
to
live
not
precisely
after
the
manner
of
a
country
landowner
nor
precisely
after
the
manner
of
a
hermit
His
days
passed
monotonously
but
he
was
not
bored
though
he
saw
no
one
he
set
diligently
and
attentively
to
work
at
farming
his
estate
rode
about
the
neighbourhood
and
did
some
reading
He
read
little
however
he
found
it
pleasanter
to
listen
to
the
tales
of
old
Anton
Lavretsky
usually
sat
at
the
window
with
a
pipe
and
a
cup
of
cold
tea
Anton
stood
at
the
door
his
hands
crossed
behind
him
and
began
upon
his
slow
deliberate
stories
of
old
times
of
those
fabulous
times
when
oats
and
rye
were
not
sold
by
measure
but
in
great
sacks
at
two
or
three
farthings
a
sack
when
there
were
impassable
forests
virgin
steppes
stretching
on
every
side
even
close
to
the
town
And
now
complained
the
old
man
whose
eightieth
year
had
passed
there
has
been
so
much
clearing
so
much
ploughing
everywhere
there
s
nowhere
you
may
drive
now
Anton
used
to
tell
many
stories
too
of
his
mistress
Glafira
Petrovna
how
prudent
and
saving
she
was
how
a
certain
gentleman
a
young
neighbour
had
paid
her
court
and
used
to
ride
over
to
see
her
and
how
she
was
even
pleased
to
put
on
her
best
cap
with
ribbons
of
salmon
colour
and
her
yellow
gown
of
tru-tru
levantine
for
him
but
how
later
on
she
had
been
angry
with
the
gentleman
neighbour
for
his
unseemly
inquiry
What
madam
pray
might
be
your
fortune
and
had
bade
them
refuse
him
the
house
and
how
it
was
then
that
she
had
given
directions
that
after
her
decease
everything
to
the
last
rag
should
pass
to
Fedor
Ivanitch
And
indeed
Lavretsky
found
all
his
aunt
s
household
goods
intact
not
excepting
the
best
cap
with
ribbons
of
salmon
colour
and
the
yellow
gown
of
tru-tru
levantine
Of
old
papers
and
interesting
documents
upon
which
Lavretsky
had
reckoned
there
seemed
no
trace
except
one
old
book
in
which
his
grandfather
Piotr
Andreitch
had
inscribed
in
one
place
Celebration
in
the
city
of
Saint
Petersburg
of
the
peace
concluded
with
the
Turkish
empire
by
his
Excellency
Prince
Alexander
Alexandrovitch
Prozorovsky
in
another
place
a
recipe
for
a
pectoral
decoction
with
the
comment
This
recipe
was
given
to
the
general
s
lady
Prascovya
Federovna
Soltikov
by
the
chief
priest
of
the
Church
of
the
Life-giving
Trinity
Fedor
Avksentyevitch
in
another
a
piece
of
political
news
of
this
kind
Somewhat
less
talk
of
the
French
tigers
and
next
this
entry
In
the
Moscow
Gazette
an
announcement
of
the
death
of
Mr
Senior-Major
Mihal
Petrovitch
Kolitchev
Is
not
this
the
son
of
Piotr
Vassilyevitch
Kolitchev
Lavretsky
found
also
some
old
calendars
and
dream-books
and
the
mysterious
work
of
Ambodik
many
were
the
memories
stirred
by
the
well-known
but
long-forgotten
Symbols
and
Emblems
In
Glafira
Petrovna
s
little
dressing-table
Lavretsky
found
a
small
packet
tied
up
with
black
ribbon
sealed
with
black
sealing
wax
and
thrust
away
in
the
very
farthest
corner
of
the
drawer
In
the
parcel
there
lay
face
to
face
a
portrait
in
pastel
of
his
father
in
his
youth
with
effeminate
curls
straying
over
his
brow
with
almond-shaped
languid
eyes
and
parted
lips
and
a
portrait
almost
effaced
of
a
pale
woman
in
a
white
dress
with
a
white
rose
in
her
hand
his
mother
Of
herself
Glafira
Petrovna
had
never
allowed
a
portrait
to
be
taken
I
myself
little
father
Fedor
Ivanitch
Anton
used
to
tell
Lavretsky
though
I
did
not
then
live
in
the
master
s
house
still
I
can
remember
your
great-grandfather
Andrey
Afanasyevitch
seeing
that
I
had
come
to
my
eighteenth
year
when
he
died
Once
I
met
him
in
the
garden
and
my
knees
were
knocking
with
fright
indeed
however
he
did
nothing
only
asked
me
my
name
and
sent
me
to
his
room
for
his
pocket-handkerchief
He
was
a
gentleman
how
shall
I
tell
you
he
didn
t
look
on
any
one
as
better
than
himself
For
your
great-grandfather
had
I
do
assure
you
a
magic
amulet
a
monk
from
Mount
Athos
made
him
a
present
of
this
amulet
And
he
told
him
this
monk
did
It
s
for
your
kindness
Boyar
I
give
you
this
wear
it
and
you
need
not
fear
judgment
Well
but
there
little
father
we
know
what
those
times
were
like
what
the
master
fancied
doing
that
he
did
Sometimes
if
even
some
gentleman
saw
fit
to
cross
him
in
anything
he
would
just
stare
at
him
and
say
You
swim
in
shallow
water
that
was
his
favourite
saying
And
he
lived
your
great-grandfather
of
blessed
memory
in
a
small
log-house
and
what
goods
he
left
behind
him
what
silver
and
stores
of
all
kinds
All
the
storehouses
were
full
and
overflowing
He
was
a
manager
That
very
decanter
that
you
were
pleased
to
admire
was
his
he
used
to
drink
brandy
out
of
it
But
there
was
your
grandfather
Piotr
Andreitch
built
himself
a
palace
of
stone
but
he
never
grew
rich
everything
with
him
went
badly
and
he
lived
worse
than
his
father
by
far
and
he
got
no
pleasure
from
it
for
himself
but
spent
all
his
money
and
now
there
is
nothing
to
remember
him
by
not
a
silver
spoon
has
come
down
from
him
and
we
have
Glafira
Petrovna
s
management
to
thank
for
all
that
is
saved
But
is
it
true
Lavretsky
interrupted
him
they
called
her
the
old
witch
What
sort
of
people
called
her
so
I
should
like
to
know
replied
Anton
with
an
air
of
displeasure
And
little
father
the
old
man
one
day
found
courage
to
ask
what
about
our
mistress
where
is
she
pleased
to
fix
her
residence
I
am
separated
from
my
wife
Lavretsky
answered
with
an
effort
please
do
not
ask
questions
about
her
Yes
sir
replied
the
old
man
mournfully
After
three
weeks
had
passed
by
Lavretsky
rode
into
O
to
the
Kalitins
and
spent
an
evening
with
them
Lemm
was
there
Lavretsky
took
a
great
liking
to
him
Although
thanks
to
his
father
he
played
no
instrument
he
was
passionately
fond
of
music
real
classical
music
Panshin
was
not
at
the
Kalitins
that
evening
The
governor
had
sent
him
off
to
some
place
out
of
the
town
Lisa
played
alone
and
very
correct
Lemm
woke
up
got
excited
twisted
a
piece
of
paper
into
a
roll
and
conducted
Marya
Dmitrievna
laughed
at
first
as
she
looked
at
him
later
on
she
went
off
to
bed
in
her
own
words
Beethoven
was
too
agitating
for
her
nerves
At
midnight
Lavretsky
accompanied
Lemm
to
his
lodging
and
stopped
there
with
him
till
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
Lemm
talked
a
great
deal
his
bent
figure
grew
erect
his
eyes
opened
wide
and
flashed
fire
his
hair
even
stood
up
on
his
forehead
It
was
so
long
since
any
one
had
shown
him
any
sympathy
and
Lavretsky
was
obviously
interested
in
him
he
was
plying
him
with
sympathetic
and
attentive
questions
This
touched
the
old
man
he
ended
by
showing
the
visitor
his
music
played
and
even
sang
in
a
faded
voice
some
extracts
from
his
works
among
others
the
whole
of
Schiller
s
ballad
Fridolin
set
by
him
to
music
Lavretsky
admired
it
made
him
repeat
some
passages
and
at
parting
invited
him
to
stay
a
few
days
with
him
Lemm
as
he
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
street
agreed
at
once
and
warmly
pressed
his
hand
but
when
he
was
left
standing
alone
in
the
fresh
damp
air
in
the
just
dawning
sunrise
he
looked
round
him
shuddered
shrank
into
himself
and
crept
up
to
his
little
room
with
a
guilty
air
Ich
bin
wohl
nicht
klug
I
must
be
out
of
my
senses
he
muttered
as
he
lay
down
in
his
hard
short
bed
He
tried
to
say
that
he
was
ill
a
few
days
later
when
Lavretsky
drove
over
to
fetch
him
in
an
open
carriage
but
Fedor
Ivanitch
went
up
into
his
room
and
managed
to
persuade
him
What
produced
the
most
powerful
effect
upon
Lemm
was
the
circumstance
that
Lavretsky
had
ordered
a
piano
from
town
to
be
sent
into
the
country
expressly
for
him
They
set
off
together
to
the
Kalitins
and
spent
the
evening
with
them
but
not
so
pleasantly
as
on
the
last
occasion
Panshin
was
there
he
talked
a
great
deal
about
his
expedition
and
very
amusingly
mimicked
and
described
the
country
gentry
he
had
seen
Lavretsky
laughed
but
Lemm
would
not
come
out
of
his
corner
and
sat
silent
slightly
tremulous
all
over
like
a
spider
looking
dull
and
sullen
and
he
only
revived
when
Lavretsky
began
to
take
leave
Even
when
he
was
sitting
in
the
carriage
the
old
man
was
still
shy
and
constrained
but
the
warm
soft
air
the
light
breeze
and
the
light
shadows
the
scent
of
the
grass
and
the
birch-buds
the
peaceful
light
of
the
starlit
moonless
night
the
pleasant
tramp
and
snort
of
the
horses
all
the
witchery
of
the
roadside
the
spring
and
the
night
sank
into
the
poor
German
s
soul
and
he
was
himself
the
first
to
begin
a
conversation
with
Lavretsky
He
began
talking
about
music
about
Lisa
then
of
music
again
He
seemed
to
enunciate
his
words
more
slowly
when
he
spoke
of
Lisa
Lavretsky
turned
the
conversation
on
his
compositions
and
half
in
jest
offered
to
write
him
a
libretto
H
m
a
libretto
replied
Lemm
no
that
is
not
in
my
line
I
have
not
now
the
liveliness
the
play
of
the
imagination
which
is
needed
for
an
opera
I
have
lost
too
much
of
my
power
But
if
I
were
still
able
to
do
something
I
should
be
content
with
a
song
of
course
I
should
like
to
have
beautiful
words
He
ceased
speaking
and
sat
a
long
while
motionless
his
eyes
lifted
to
the
heavens
For
instance
he
said
at
last
something
in
this
way
Ye
stars
ye
pure
stars
Lavretsky
turned
his
face
slightly
towards
him
and
began
to
look
at
him
Ye
stars
pure
stars
repeated
Lemm
You
look
down
upon
the
righteous
and
guilty
alike
but
only
the
pure
in
heart
or
something
of
that
kind
comprehend
you
that
is
no
love
you
But
I
am
not
a
poet
I
m
not
equal
to
it
Something
for
that
kind
though
something
lofty
Lemm
pushed
his
hat
on
to
the
back
of
his
head
in
the
dim
twilight
of
the
clear
night
his
face
looked
paler
and
younger
And
you
too
he
continued
his
voice
gradually
sinking
ye
know
who
loves
who
can
love
because
pure
ones
ye
alone
can
comfort
No
that
s
not
it
at
all
I
am
not
a
poet
he
said
but
something
of
that
sort
I
am
sorry
I
am
not
a
poet
observed
Lavretsky
Vain
dreams
replied
Lemm
and
he
buried
himself
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
He
closed
his
eyes
as
though
he
were
disposing
himself
to
sleep
A
few
instants
passed
Lavretsky
listened
Stars
pure
stars
love
muttered
the
old
man
Love
Lavretsky
repeated
to
himself
He
sank
into
thought
and
his
heart
grew
heavy
That
is
beautiful
music
you
have
set
to
Fridolin
Christopher
Fedoritch
he
said
aloud
but
what
do
you
suppose
did
that
Fridolin
do
after
the
Count
had
presented
him
to
his
wife
became
her
lover
eh
You
think
so
replied
Lemm
probably
because
experience
he
stopped
suddenly
and
turned
away
in
confusion
Lavretsky
laughed
constrainedly
and
also
turned
away
and
began
gazing
at
the
road
The
stars
had
begun
to
grow
paler
and
the
sky
had
turned
grey
when
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
steps
of
the
little
house
in
Vassilyevskoe
Lavretsky
conducted
his
guest
to
the
room
prepared
for
him
returned
to
his
study
and
sat
down
before
the
window
In
the
garden
a
nightingale
was
singing
its
last
song
before
dawn
Lavretsky
remember
that
a
nightingale
had
sung
in
the
garden
at
the
Kalitins
he
remembered
too
the
soft
stir
in
Lisa
s
eyes
as
at
its
first
notes
they
turned
towards
the
dark
window
He
began
to
think
of
her
and
his
heart
was
calm
again
Pure
maiden
he
murmured
half-aloud
pure
stars
he
added
with
a
smile
and
went
peacefully
to
bed
But
Lemm
sat
a
long
while
on
his
bed
a
music-book
on
his
knees
He
felt
as
though
sweet
unheard
melody
was
haunting
him
already
he
was
all
aglow
and
astir
already
he
felt
the
languor
and
sweetness
of
its
presence
but
he
could
not
reach
it
Neither
poet
nor
musician
he
muttered
at
last
And
his
tired
head
sank
wearily
on
to
the
pillows
The
next
morning
the
master
of
the
house
and
his
guest
drank
tea
in
the
garden
under
an
old
time-tree
Master
said
Lavretsky
among
other
things
you
will
soon
have
to
compose
a
triumphal
cantata
On
what
occasion
For
the
nuptials
of
Mr
Panshin
and
Lisa
Did
you
notice
what
attention
he
paid
her
yesterday
It
seems
as
though
things
were
in
a
fair
way
with
them
already
That
will
never
be
cried
Lemm
Why
Because
it
is
impossible
Though
indeed
he
added
after
a
short
pause
everything
is
possible
in
this
world
Especially
here
among
you
in
Russia
We
will
leave
Russia
out
of
the
question
for
a
time
but
what
do
you
find
amiss
in
this
match
Everything
is
amiss
everything
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
is
a
girl
of
high
principles
serious
of
lofty
feelings
and
he
he
is
a
dilettante
in
a
word
But
suppose
she
loves
him
Lemm
got
up
from
the
bench
No
she
does
not
love
him
that
is
to
say
she
is
very
pure
in
heart
and
does
not
know
herself
what
it
means
love
Madame
von
Kalitin
tells
her
that
he
is
a
fine
young
man
and
she
obeys
Madame
von
Kalitin
because
she
is
still
quite
a
child
though
she
is
nineteen
she
says
her
prayers
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
and
that
is
very
well
but
she
does
not
love
him
She
can
only
love
what
is
beautiful
and
he
is
not
that
is
his
soul
is
not
beautiful
Lemm
uttered
this
whole
speech
coherently
and
with
fire
walking
with
little
steps
to
and
fro
before
the
tea-table
and
running
his
eyes
over
the
ground
Dearest
maestro
cried
Lavretsky
suddenly
it
strikes
me
you
are
in
love
with
cousin
yourself
Lemm
stopped
short
all
at
once
I
beg
you
he
began
in
an
uncertain
voice
do
not
make
fun
of
me
like
that
I
am
not
crazy
I
look
towards
the
dark
grave
not
towards
a
rosy
future
Lavretsky
felt
sorry
for
the
old
man
he
begged
his
pardon
After
morning
tea
Lemm
played
him
his
cantata
and
after
dinner
at
Lavretsky
s
initiative
there
was
again
talk
of
Lisa
Lavretsky
listened
to
him
with
attention
and
curiosity
What
do
you
say
Christopher
Fedoritch
he
said
at
last
you
see
everything
here
seems
in
good
order
now
and
the
garden
is
in
full
bloom
couldn
t
we
invite
her
over
here
for
a
day
