watchmaker
had
displayed
it
in
his
shop-window
Nastasey
Nastasyeitch
had
seen
it
as
he
passed
by
bought
it
and
brought
it
along
with
him
However
my
ordeal
and
Yushka
's
did
not
last
long
my
father
gasped
for
breath
and
coughed
till
he
choked
indeed
it
was
not
in
his
character
to
be
angry
long
Brother
Porfiry
Petrovitch
observed
my
aunt
as
soon
as
she
noticed
not
without
regret
that
my
father
's
anger
had
so
to
speak
flickered
out
do
n't
you
worry
yourself
further
it
's
not
worth
dirtying
your
hands
over
I
tell
you
what
I
suggest
with
the
consent
of
our
honoured
friend
Nastasey
Nastasyeitch
in
consideration
of
the
base
ingratitude
of
your
son
I
will
take
charge
of
the
watch
and
since
he
has
shown
by
his
conduct
that
he
is
not
worthy
to
wear
it
and
does
not
even
understand
its
value
I
will
present
it
in
your
name
to
a
person
who
will
be
very
sensible
of
your
kindness
Whom
do
you
mean
asked
my
father
To
Hrisanf
Lukitch
my
aunt
articulated
with
slight
hesitation
To
Hrisashka
asked
my
father
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
added
It
's
all
one
to
me
You
can
throw
it
in
the
stove
if
you
like
He
buttoned
up
his
open
vest
and
went
out
writhing
from
his
coughing
And
you
my
good
friend
do
you
agree
said
my
aunt
addressing
Nastasey
Nastasyeitch
I
am
quite
agreeable
responded
the
latter
During
the
whole
proceedings
he
had
not
stirred
and
only
snorting
stealthily
and
stealthily
rubbing
the
ends
of
his
fingers
had
fixed
his
foxy
eyes
by
turns
on
me
on
my
father
and
on
Yushka
We
afforded
him
real
gratification
My
aunt
's
suggestion
revolted
me
to
the
depths
of
my
soul
It
was
not
that
I
regretted
the
watch
but
the
person
to
whom
she
proposed
to
present
it
was
absolutely
hateful
to
me
This
Hrisanf
Lukitch
his
surname
was
Trankvillitatin
a
stalwart
robust
lanky
divinity
student
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
our
house
goodness
knows
what
for
to
help
the
children
with
their
lessons
my
aunt
asserted
but
he
could
not
help
us
with
our
lessons
because
he
had
never
learnt
anything
himself
and
was
as
stupid
as
a
horse
He
was
rather
like
a
horse
altogether
he
thudded
with
his
feet
as
though
they
had
been
hoofs
did
not
laugh
but
neighed
opening
his
jaws
till
you
could
see
right
down
his
throat
and
he
had
a
long
face
a
hooked
nose
and
big
flat
jaw-bones
he
wore
a
shaggy
frieze
full-skirted
coat
and
smelt
of
raw
meat
My
aunt
idolised
him
and
called
him
a
good-looking
man
a
cavalier
and
even
a
grenadier
He
had
a
habit
of
tapping
children
on
the
forehead
with
the
nails
of
his
long
fingers
hard
as
stones
he
used
to
do
it
to
me
when
I
was
younger
and
as
he
tapped
he
would
chuckle
and
say
with
surprise
How
your
head
resounds
it
must
be
empty
And
this
lout
was
to
possess
my
watch
No
indeed
I
determined
in
my
own
mind
as
I
ran
out
of
the
drawing-room
and
flung
myself
on
my
bed
while
my
cheek
glowed
crimson
from
the
slap
I
had
received
and
my
heart
too
was
aglow
with
the
bitterness
of
the
insult
and
the
thirst
for
revenge
no
indeed
I
would
not
allow
that
cursed
Hrisashka
to
jeer
at
me
He
would
put
on
the
watch
let
the
chain
hang
over
his
stomach
would
neigh
with
delight
no
indeed
Quite
so
but
how
was
it
to
be
done
how
to
prevent
it
I
determined
to
steal
the
watch
from
my
aunt
Luckily
Trankvillitatin
was
away
from
the
town
at
the
time
he
could
not
come
to
us
before
the
next
day
I
must
take
advantage
of
the
night
My
aunt
did
not
lock
her
bedroom
door
and
indeed
none
of
the
keys
in
the
house
would
turn
in
the
locks
but
where
would
she
put
the
watch
where
would
she
hide
it
She
kept
it
in
her
pocket
till
the
evening
and
even
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
more
than
once
but
at
night
where
would
it
be
at
night
Well
that
was
just
my
work
to
find
out
I
thought
shaking
my
fists
I
was
burning
with
boldness
and
terror
and
joy
at
the
thought
of
the
approaching
crime
I
was
continually
nodding
to
myself
I
knitted
my
brows
I
whispered
Wait
a
bit
I
threatened
someone
I
was
wicked
I
was
dangerous
and
I
avoided
David
no
one
not
even
he
must
have
the
slightest
suspicion
of
what
I
meant
to
do
I
would
act
alone
and
alone
I
would
answer
for
it
Slowly
the
day
lagged
by
then
the
evening
at
last
the
night
came
I
did
nothing
I
even
tried
not
to
move
one
thought
was
stuck
in
my
head
like
a
nail
At
dinner
my
father
who
was
as
I
have
said
naturally
gentle
and
who
was
a
little
ashamed
of
his
harshness
boys
of
sixteen
are
not
slapped
in
the
face
tried
to
be
affectionate
to
me
but
I
rejected
his
overtures
not
from
slowness
to
forgive
as
he
imagined
at
the
time
but
simply
that
I
was
afraid
of
my
feelings
getting
the
better
of
me
I
wanted
to
preserve
untouched
all
the
heat
of
my
vengeance
all
the
hardness
of
unalterable
determination
I
went
to
bed
very
early
but
of
course
I
did
not
sleep
and
did
not
even
shut
my
eyes
but
on
the
contrary
opened
them
wide
though
I
did
pull
the
quilt
over
my
head
I
did
not
consider
beforehand
how
to
act
I
had
no
plan
of
any
kind
I
only
waited
till
everything
should
be
quiet
in
the
house
I
only
took
one
step
I
did
not
remove
my
stockings
My
aunt's
room
was
on
the
second
floor
One
had
to
pass
through
the
dining-room
and
the
hall
go
up
the
stairs
pass
along
a
little
passage
and
there
on
the
right
was
the
door
I
must
not
on
any
account
take
with
me
a
candle
or
a
lantern
in
the
corner
of
my
aunt
's
room
a
little
lamp
was
always
burning
before
the
ikon
shrine
I
knew
that
So
I
should
be
able
to
see
I
still
lay
with
staring
eyes
and
my
mouth
open
and
parched
the
blood
was
throbbing
in
my
temples
in
my
ears
in
my
throat
in
my
back
all
over
me
I
waited
but
it
seemed
as
though
some
demon
were
mocking
me
time
passed
and
passed
but
still
silence
did
not
reign
Never
I
thought
had
David
been
so
late
getting
to
sleep
David
the
silent
David
even
began
talking
to
me
Never
had
they
gone
on
so
long
banging
talking
walking
about
the
house
And
what
could
they
be
talking
about
I
wondered
as
though
they
had
not
had
the
whole
day
to
talk
in
Sounds
outside
persisted
too
first
a
dog
barked
on
a
shrill
obstinate
note
then
a
drunken
peasant
was
making
an
uproar
somewhere
and
would
not
be
pacified
then
gates
kept
creaking
then
a
wretched
cart
on
racketty
wheels
kept
passing
and
passing
and
seeming
as
though
it
would
never
pass
However
these
sounds
did
not
worry
me
on
the
contrary
I
was
glad
of
them
they
seemed
to
distract
my
attention
But
now
at
last
it
seemed
as
though
all
were
tranquil
Only
the
pendulum
of
our
old
clock
ticked
gravely
and
drowsily
in
the
dining-room
and
there
was
an
even
drawn-out
sound
like
the
hard
breathing
of
people
asleep
I
was
on
the
point
of
getting
up
then
again
something
rustled
then
suddenly
sighed
something
soft
fell
down
and
a
whisper
glided
along
the
walls
Or
was
there
nothing
of
the
sort
and
was
it
only
imagination
mocking
me
At
last
all
was
still
It
was
the
very
heart
the
very
dead
of
night
The
time
had
come
Chill
with
anticipation
I
threw
off
the
bedclothes
let
my
feet
down
to
the
floor
stood
up
one
step
a
second
I
stole
along
my
feet
heavy
as
though
they
did
not
belong
to
me
trod
feebly
and
uncertainly
Stay
what
was
that
sound
Someone
sawing
somewhere
or
scraping
or
sighing
I
listened
I
felt
my
cheeks
twitching
and
cold
watery
tears
came
into
my
eyes
Nothing
I
stole
on
again
It
was
dark
but
I
knew
the
way
All
at
once
I
stumbled
against
a
chair
What
a
bang
and
how
it
hurt
It
hit
me
just
on
my
leg
I
stood
stock
still
Well
did
that
wake
them
Ah
here
goes
Suddenly
I
felt
bold
and
even
spiteful
On
On
Now
the
dining-room
was
crossed
then
the
door
was
groped
for
and
opened
at
one
swing
The
cursed
hinge
squeaked
bother
it
Then
I
went
up
the
stairs
one
two
one
two
A
step
creaked
under
my
foot
I
looked
at
it
spitefully
just
as
though
I
could
see
it
Then
I
stretched
for
the
handle
of
another
door
This
one
made
not
the
slightest
sound
It
flew
open
so
easily
as
though
to
say
Pray
walk
in
And
now
I
was
in
the
corridor
In
the
corridor
there
was
a
little
window
high
up
under
the
ceiling
a
faint
light
filtered
in
through
the
dark
panes
And
in
that
glimmer
of
light
I
could
see
our
little
errand
girl
lying
on
the
floor
on
a
mat
both
arms
behind
her
tousled
head
she
was
sound
asleep
breathing
rapidly
and
the
fatal
door
was
just
behind
her
head
I
stepped
across
the
mat
across
the
girl
who
opened
that
door
I
do
n't
know
but
there
I
was
in
my
aunt
's
room
There
was
the
little
lamp
in
one
corner
and
the
bed
in
the
other
and
my
aunt
in
her
cap
and
night
jacket
on
the
bed
with
her
face
towards
me
She
was
asleep
she
did
not
stir
I
could
not
even
hear
her
breathing
The
flame
of
the
little
lamp
softly
flickered
stirred
by
the
draught
of
fresh
air
and
shadows
stirred
all
over
the
room
even
over
the
motionless
wax-like
yellow
face
of
my
aunt
And
there
was
the
watch
It
was
hanging
on
a
little
embroidered
cushion
on
the
wall
behind
the
bed
What
luck
only
think
of
it
Nothing
to
delay
me
But
whose
steps
were
those
soft
and
rapid
behind
my
back
Oh
no
it
was
my
heart
beating
I
moved
my
legs
forward
Good
God
something
round
and
rather
large
pushed
against
me
below
my
knee
once
and
again
I
was
ready
to
scream
I
was
ready
to
drop
with
horror
A
striped
cat
our
own
cat
was
standing
before
me
arching
his
back
and
wagging
his
tail
Then
he
leapt
on
the
bed
softly
and
heavily
turned
round
and
sat
without
purring
exactly
like
a
judge
he
sat
and
looked
at
me
with
his
golden
pupils
Puss
puss
I
whispered
hardly
audibly
I
bent
across
my
aunt
I
had
already
snatched
the
watch
She
suddenly
sat
up
and
opened
her
eyelids
wide
Heavenly
Father
what
next
but
her
eyelids
quivered
and
closed
and
with
a
faint
murmur
her
head
sank
on
the
pillow
A
minute
later
I
was
back
again
in
my
own
room
in
my
own
bed
and
the
watch
was
in
my
hands
More
lightly
than
a
feather
I
flew
back
I
was
a
fine
fellow
I
was
a
thief
I
was
a
hero
I
was
gasping
with
delight
I
was
hot
I
was
gleeful
I
wanted
to
wake
David
at
once
to
tell
him
all
about
it
and
incredible
as
it
sounds
I
fell
asleep
and
slept
like
the
dead
At
last
I
opened
my
eyes
It
was
light
in
the
room
the
sun
had
risen
Luckily
no
one
was
awake
yet
I
jumped
up
as
though
I
had
been
scalded
woke
David
and
told
him
all
about
it
He
listened
smiled
Do
you
know
what
he
said
to
me
at
last
let
's
bury
the
silly
watch
in
the
earth
so
that
it
may
never
be
seen
again
I
thought
his
idea
best
of
all
In
a
few
minutes
we
were
both
dressed
we
ran
out
into
the
orchard
behind
our
house
and
under
an
old
apple
tree
in
a
deep
hole
hurriedly
scooped
out
in
the
soft
springy
earth
with
David's
big
knife
my
godfather
's
hated
present
was
hidden
forever
so
that
it
never
got
into
the
hands
of
the
disgusting
Trankvillitatin
after
all
We
stamped
down
the
hole
strewed
rubbish
over
it
and
proud
and
happy
unnoticed
by
anyone
went
home
again
got
into
our
beds
and
slept
another
hour
or
two
and
such
a
light
and
blissful
sleep
You
can
imagine
the
uproar
there
was
that
morning
as
soon
as
my
aunt
woke
up
and
missed
the
watch
Her
piercing
shriek
is
ringing
in
my
ears
to
this
day
Help
Robbed
Robbed
she
squealed
and
alarmed
the
whole
household
She
was
furious
while
David
and
I
only
smiled
to
ourselves
and
sweet
was
our
smile
to
us
Everyone
everyone
must
be
well
thrashed
bawled
my
aunt
The
watch
has
been
stolen
from
under
my
head
from
under
my
pillow
We
were
prepared
for
anything
we
expected
trouble
But
contrary
to
our
expectations
we
did
not
get
into
trouble
at
all
My
father
certainly
did
fume
dreadfully
at
first
he
even
talked
of
the
police
but
I
suppose
he
was
bored
with
the
enquiry
of
the
day
before
and
suddenly
to
my
aunt
's
indescribable
amazement
he
flew
out
not
against
us
but
against
her
You
sicken
me
worse
than
a
bitter
radish
Pelageya
Petrovna
he
shouted
with
your
watch
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
any
more
about
it
It
ca
n't
be
lost
by
magic
you
say
but
what
's
it
to
do
with
me
It
may
be
magic
for
all
I
care
Stolen
from
you
Well
good
luck
to
it
then
What
will
Nastasey
Nastasyeitch
say
Damnation
take
him
your
Nastasyeitch
I
get
nothing
but
annoyances
and
unpleasantness
from
him
Do
n't
dare
to
worry
me
again
Do
you
hear
My
father
slammed
the
door
and
went
off
to
his
own
room
David
and
I
did
not
at
first
understand
the
allusion
in
his
last
words
but
afterwards
we
found
out
that
my
father
was
just
then
violently
indignant
with
my
godfather
who
had
done
him
out
of
a
profitable
job
So
my
aunt
was
left
looking
a
fool
She
almost
burst
with
vexation
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
She
had
to
confine
herself
to
repeating
in
a
sharp
whisper
twisting
her
mouth
in
my
direction
whenever
she
passed
me
Thief
thief
robber
scoundrel
My
aunt
's
reproaches
were
a
source
of
real
enjoyment
to
me
It
was
very
agreeable
too
as
I
crossed
the
flower-garden
to
let
my
eye
with
assumed
indifference
glide
over
the
very
spot
where
the
watch
lay
at
rest
under
the
apple-tree
and
if
David
were
close
at
hand
to
exchange
a
meaning
grimace
with
him
My
aunt
tried
setting
Trankvillitatin
upon
me
but
I
appealed
to
David
He
told
the
stalwart
divinity
student
bluntly
that
he
would
rip
up
his
belly
with
a
knife
if
he
did
not
leave
me
alone
Trankvillitatin
was
frightened
though
according
to
my
aunt
he
was
a
grenadier
and
a
cavalier
he
was
not
remarkable
for
valour
So
passed
five
weeks
But
do
you
imagine
that
the
story
of
the
watch
ended
there
No
it
did
not
only
to
continue
my
story
I
must
introduce
a
new
character
and
to
introduce
that
new
character
I
must
go
back
a
little
My
father
had
for
many
years
been
on
very
friendly
even
intimate
terms
with
a
retired
government
clerk
called
Latkin
a
lame
little
man
in
poor
circumstances
with
queer
timid
manners
one
of
those
creatures
of
whom
it
is
commonly
said
that
they
are
crushed
by
God
Himself
Like
my
father
and
Nastasey
he
was
engaged
in
the
humbler
class
of
legal
work
and
acted
as
legal
adviser
and
agent
But
possessing
neither
a
presentable
appearance
nor
the
gift
of
words
and
having
little
confidence
in
himself
he
did
not
venture
to
act
independently
but
attached
himself
to
my
father
His
handwriting
was
regular
beadwork
he
knew
the
law
thoroughly
and
had
mastered
all
the
intricacies
of
the
jargon
of
petitions
and
legal
documents
He
had
managed
various
cases
with
my
father
and
had
shared
with
him
gains
and
losses
and
it
seemed
as
though
nothing
could
shake
their
friendship
and
yet
it
broke
down
in
one
day
and
forever
My
father
quarrelled
with
his
colleague
for
good
If
Latkin
had
snatched
a
profitable
job
from
my
father
after
the
fashion
of
Nastasey
who
replaced
him
later
on
my
father
would
have
been
no
more
indignant
with
him
than
with
Nastasey
probably
less
But
Latkin
under
the
influence
of
an
unexplained
incomprehensible
feeling
envy
greed
or
perhaps
even
a
momentary
fit
of
honesty
gave
away
my
father
betrayed
him
to
their
common
client
a
wealthy
young
merchant
opening
this
careless
young
man
's
eyes
to
a
certain
well
piece
of
sharp
practice
destined
to
bring
my
father
considerable
profit
It
was
not
the
money
loss
however
great
no
but
the
betrayal
that
wounded
and
infuriated
my
father
he
could
not
forgive
treachery
So
he
sets
himself
up
for
a
saint
he
repeated
trembling
all
over
with
anger
his
teeth
chattering
as
though
he
were
in
a
fever
I
happened
to
be
in
the
room
and
was
a
witness
of
this
ugly
scene
Good
Amen
from
today
It
's
all
over
between
us
There
's
the
ikon
and
there
's
the
door
Neither
you
in
my
house
nor
I
in
yours
You
are
too
honest
for
us
How
can
we
keep
company
with
you
But
may
you
have
no
house
nor
home
It
was
in
vain
that
Latkin
entreated
my
father
and
bowed
down
before
him
it
was
in
vain
that
he
tried
to
explain
to
him
what
filled
his
own
soul
with
painful
perplexity
You
know
it
was
with
no
sort
of
profit
to
myself
Porfiry
Petrovitch
he
faltered
why
I
cut
my
own
throat
My
father
remained
implacable
Latkin
never
set
foot
in
our
house
again
Fate
itself
seemed
determined
to
carry
out
my
father's
last
cruel
words
Soon
after
the
rupture
which
took
place
two
years
before
the
beginning
of
my
story
Latkin
's
wife
who
had
it
is
true
been
ill
for
a
long
time
died
his
second
daughter
a
child
three
years
old
became
deaf
and
dumb
in
one
day
from
terror
a
swarm
of
bees
had
settled
on
her
head
Latkin
himself
had
an
apoplectic
stroke
and
sank
into
extreme
and
hopeless
poverty
How
he
struggled
on
what
he
lived
upon
it
is
hard
to
imagine
He
lived
in
a
dilapidated
hovel
at
no
great
distance
from
our
house
His
elder
daughter
Raissa
lived
with
him
and
kept
house
so
far
as
that
was
possible
This
Raissa
is
the
character
whom
I
must
now
introduce
into
our
story
When
her
father
was
on
friendly
terms
with
mine
we
used
to
see
her
continually
She
would
sit
with
us
for
hours
at
a
time
either
sewing
or
spinning
with
her
delicate
rapid
clever
fingers
She
was
a
well-made
rather
thin
girl
with
intelligent
brown
eyes
and
a
long
white
oval
face
She
talked
little
but
sensibly
in
a
soft
musical
voice
barely
opening
her
mouth
and
not
showing
her
teeth
When
she
laughed
which
happened
rarely
and
never
lasted
long
they
were
all
suddenly
displayed
big
and
white
as
almonds
I
remember
her
gait
too
light
elastic
with
a
little
skip
at
each
step
It
always
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
going
down
a
flight
of
steps
even
when
she
was
walking
on
level
ground
She
held
herself
erect
with
her
arms
folded
tightly
over
her
bosom
And
whatever
she
was
doing
whatever
she
undertook
if
she
were
only
threading
a
needle
or
ironing
a
petticoat
the
effect
was
always
beautiful
and
somehow
you
may
not
believe
it
touching
Her
Christian
name
was
Raissa
but
we
used
to
call
her
Black-lip
she
had
on
her
upper
lip
a
birthmark
a
little
dark-bluish
spot
as
though
she
had
been
eating
blackberries
but
that
did
not
spoil
her
on
the
contrary
She
was
just
a
year
older
than
David
I
cherished
for
her
a
feeling
akin
to
respect
but
we
were
not
great
friends
But
between
her
and
David
a
friendship
had
sprung
up
a
strange
unchildlike
but
good
friendship
They
somehow
suited
each
other
Sometimes
they
did
not
exchange
a
word
for
hours
together
but
both
felt
that
they
were
happy
and
happy
because
they
were
together
I
had
never
met
a
girl
like
her
really
There
was
something
attentive
and
resolute
about
her
something
honest
and
mournful
and
charming
I
never
heard
her
say
anything
very
intelligent
but
I
never
heard
her
say
anything
commonplace
and
I
have
never
seen
more
intelligent
eyes
After
the
rupture
between
her
family
and
mine
I
saw
her
less
frequently
my
father
sternly
forbade
my
visiting
the
Latkins
and
she
did
not
appear
in
our
house
again
But
I
met
her
in
the
street
in
church
and
Black-lip
always
aroused
in
me
the
same
feeling
respect
and
even
some
wonder
rather
than
pity
She
bore
her
misfortunes
very
well
indeed
The
girl
is
flint
even
coarse-witted
Trankvillitatin
said
about
her
once
but
really
she
ought
to
have
been
pitied
her
face
acquired
a
careworn
exhausted
expression
her
eyes
were
hollow
and
sunken
a
burden
beyond
her
strength
lay
on
her
young
shoulders
David
saw
her
much
oftener
than
I
did
he
used
to
go
to
their
house
My
father
gave
him
up
in
despair
he
knew
that
David
would
not
obey
him
anyway
And
from
time
to
time
Raissa
would
appear
at
the
hurdle
fence
of
our
garden
which
looked
into
a
lane
and
there
have
an
interview
with
David
she
did
not
come
for
the
sake
of
conversation
but
told
him
of
some
new
difficulty
or
trouble
and
asked
his
advice
The
paralysis
that
had
attacked
Latkin
was
of
a
rather
peculiar
kind
His
arms
and
legs
had
grown
feeble
but
he
had
not
lost
the
use
of
them
and
his
brain
indeed
worked
perfectly
but
his
speech
was
muddled
and
instead
of
one
word
he
would
pronounce
another
one
had
to
guess
what
it
was
he
wanted
to
say
Tchoo
tchoo
tchoo
he
would
stammer
with
an
effort
he
began
every
sentence
with
Tchoo
tchoo
tchoo
some
scissors
some
scissors
and
the
word
scissors
meant
bread
My
father
he
hated
with
all
the
strength
left
him
he
attributed
all
his
misfortunes
to
my
father
's
curse
and
called
him
alternately
the
butcher
and
the
diamond-merchant
Tchoo
tchoo
do
n't
you
dare
to
go
to
the
butcher
's
Vassilyevna
This
was
what
he
called
his
daughter
though
his
own
name
was
Martinyan
Every
day
he
became
more
exacting
his
needs
increased
And
how
were
those
needs
to
be
satisfied
Where
could
the
money
be
found
Sorrow
soon
makes
one
old
but
it
was
horrible
to
hear
some
words
on
the
lips
of
a
girl
of
seventeen
I
remember
I
happened
to
be
present
at
a
conversation
with
David
over
the
fence
on
the
very
day
of
her
mother
's
death
Mother
died
this
morning
at
daybreak
she
said
first
looking
round
with
her
dark
expressive
eyes
and
then
fixing
them
on
the
ground
Cook
undertook
to
get
a
coffin
cheap
but
she
's
not
to
be
trusted
she
may
spend
the
money
on
drink
even
You
might
come
and
look
after
her
Davidushka
she
's
afraid
of
you
I
will
come
answered
David
I
will
see
to
it
And
how
's
your
father
He
cries
he
says
'you
must
spoil
me
too
Spoil
must
mean
bury
Now
he
has
gone
to
sleep
Raissa
suddenly
gave
a
deep
sigh
Oh
Davidushka
Davidushka
She
passed
her
half-clenched
fist
over
her
forehead
and
her
eyebrows
and
the
action
was
so
bitter
and
as
sincere
and
beautiful
as
all
her
actions
You
must
take
care
of
yourself
though
David
observed
you
haven't
slept
at
all
I
expect
And
what
's
the
use
of
crying
It
doesn't
help
trouble
I
have
no
time
for
crying
answered
Raissa
That
's
a
luxury
for
the
rich
crying
observed
David
Raissa
was
going
but
she
turned
back
The
yellow
shawl
's
being
sold
you
know
part
of
mother
's
dowry
They
are
giving
us
twelve
roubles
I
think
that
is
not
much
It
certainly
is
not
much
We
should
n't
sell
it
Raissa
said
after
a
brief
pause
but
you
see
we
must
have
money
for
the
funeral
Of
course
you
must
Only
you
must
n't
spend
money
at
random
Those
priests
are
awful
But
I
say
wait
a
minute
I
'll
come
Are
you
going
I
'll
be
with
you
soon
Goodbye
darling
Good-bye
Davidushka
darling
Mind
now
do
n't
cry
As
though
I
should
cry
It
's
either
cooking
the
dinner
or
crying
One
or
the
other
What
does
she
cook
the
dinner
I
said
to
David
as
soon
as
Raissa
was
out
of
hearing
does
she
do
the
cooking
herself
Why
you
heard
that
the
cook
has
gone
to
buy
a
coffin
She
cooks
the
dinner
I
thought
and
her
hands
are
always
so
clean
and
her
clothes
so
neat
I
should
like
to
see
her
there
at
work
in
the
kitchen
She
is
an
extraordinary
girl
I
remember
another
conversation
at
the
fence
That
time
Raissa
brought
with
her
her
little
deaf
and
dumb
sister
She
was
a
pretty
child
with
immense
astonished-looking
eyes
and
a
perfect
mass
of
dull
black
hair
on
her
little
head
Raissa
's
hair
too
was
black
and
hers
too
was
without
lustre
Latkin
had
by
then
been
struck
down
by
paralysis
I
really
do
n't
know
what
to
do
Raissa
began
The
doctor
has
written
a
prescription
We
must
go
to
the
chemist
's
and
our
peasant
Latkin
had
still
one
serf
has
brought
us
wood
from
the
village
and
a
goose
And
the
porter
has
taken
it
away
'you
are
in
debt
to
me
he
said
Taken
the
goose
asked
David
No
not
the
goose
He
says
it
is
an
old
one
it
is
no
good
for
anything
he
says
that
is
why
our
peasant
brought
it
us
but
he
is
taking
the
wood
But
he
has
no
right
to
exclaimed
David
He
has
no
right
to
but
he
has
taken
it
I
went
up
to
the
garret
there
we
have
got
a
very
very
old
trunk
I
began
rummaging
in
it
and
what
do
you
think
I
found
Look
She
took
from
under
her
kerchief
a
rather
large
field
glass
in
a
copper
setting
covered
with
morocco
yellow
with
age
David
as
a
connoisseur
of
all
sorts
of
instruments
seized
upon
it
at
once
It
's
English
he
pronounced
putting
it
first
to
one
eye
and
then
to
the
other
A
marine
glass
And
the
glasses
are
perfect
Raissa
went
on
I
showed
it
to
father
he
said
'Take
it
and
pawn
it
to
the
diamond-merchant
What
do
you
think
would
they
give
us
anything
for
it
What
do
we
want
a
telescope
for
To
look
at
ourselves
in
the
looking-glass
and
see
what
beauties
we
are
But
we
have
n't
a
looking-glass
unluckily
And
Raissa
suddenly
laughed
aloud
Her
sister
of
course
could
not
hear
her
But
most
likely
she
felt
the
shaking
of
her
body
she
clung
to
Raissa
's
hand
and
her
little
face
worked
with
a
look
of
terror
as
she
raised
her
big
eyes
to
her
sister
and
burst
into
tears
That
's
how
she
always
is
said
Raissa
she
does
n't
like
one
to
laugh
Come
I
wo
n't
Lyubotchka
I
wo
n't
she
added
nimbly
squatting
on
her
heels
beside
the
child
and
passing
her
fingers
through
her
hair
The
laughter
vanished
from
Raissa
's
face
and
her
lips
the
corners
of
which
twisted
upwards
in
a
particularly
charming
way
became
motionless
again
The
child
was
pacified
Raissa
got
up
So
you
will
do
what
you
can
about
the
glass
I
mean
Davidushka
But
I
do
regret
the
wood
and
the
goose
too
however
old
it
may
be
They
would
certainly
give
you
ten
roubles
said
David
turning
the
telescope
in
all
directions
I
will
buy
it
of
you
what
could
be
better
And
here
meanwhile
are
fifteen
kopecks
for
the
chemist
's
Is
that
enough
I
'll
borrow
that
from
you
whispered
Raissa
taking
the
fifteen
kopecks
from
him
What
next
Perhaps
you
would
like
to
pay
interest
But
you
see
I
have
a
pledge
here
a
very
fine
thing
First-rate
people
the
English
They
say
we
are
going
to
war
with
them
No
answered
David
we
are
fighting
the
French
now
Well
you
know
best
Take
care
of
it
then
Good-bye
friends
Here
is
another
conversation
that
took
place
beside
the
same
fence
Raissa
seemed
more
worried
than
usual
Five
kopecks
for
a
cabbage
and
a
tiny
little
one
too
she
said
propping
her
chin
on
her
hand
Is
n't
it
dear
And
I
have
n't
had
the
money
for
my
sewing
yet
Who
owes
it
you
asked
David
Why
the
merchant
's
wife
who
lives
beyond
the
rampart
The
fat
woman
who
goes
about
in
a
green
blouse
Yes
yes
I
say
she
is
fat
She
can
hardly
breathe
for
fat
She
positively
steams
in
church
and
does
n't
pay
her
debts
She
will
pay
only
when
And
do
you
know
Davidushka
I
have
fresh
troubles
Father
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
tell
me
his
dreams
you
know
he
can
not
say
what
he
means
if
he
wants
to
say
one
word
it
comes
out
another
About
food
or
any
everyday
thing
we
have
