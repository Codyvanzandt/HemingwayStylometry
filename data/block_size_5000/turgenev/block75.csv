Elena
decided
that
she
had
never
seen
a
more
charming
little
face
Anna
Vassilyevna
came
in
Elena
felt
a
pang
but
with
what
tenderness
she
embraced
her
mother
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
near
the
hair
already
slightly
grey
Then
she
went
away
to
her
own
room
how
everything
smiled
upon
her
there
With
what
a
sense
of
shamefaced
triumph
and
tranquillity
she
sat
down
on
her
bed
the
very
bed
on
which
only
three
hours
ago
she
had
spent
such
bitter
moments
And
yet
even
then
I
knew
he
loved
me
she
thought
even
before
Ah
no
it
s
a
sin
You
are
my
wife
she
whispered
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
and
falling
on
her
knees
Towards
the
evening
she
grew
more
thoughtful
Sadness
came
upon
her
at
the
thought
that
she
would
not
soon
see
Insarov
He
could
not
without
awakening
suspicion
remain
at
Bersenyev
s
and
so
this
was
what
he
and
Elena
had
resolved
on
Insarov
was
to
return
to
Moscow
and
to
come
over
to
visit
them
twice
before
the
autumn
on
her
side
she
promised
to
write
him
letters
and
if
it
were
possible
to
arrange
a
meeting
with
him
somewhere
near
Kuntsov
She
went
down
to
the
drawing-room
to
tea
and
found
there
all
the
household
and
Shubin
who
looked
at
her
sharply
directly
she
came
in
she
tried
to
talk
to
him
in
a
friendly
way
as
of
old
but
she
dreaded
his
penetration
she
was
afraid
of
herself
She
felt
sure
that
there
was
good
reason
for
his
having
left
her
alone
for
more
than
a
fortnight
Soon
Bersenyev
arrived
and
gave
Insarov
s
respects
to
Anna
Vassilyevna
with
an
apology
for
having
gone
back
to
Moscow
without
calling
to
take
leave
of
her
Insarov
s
name
was
for
the
first
time
during
the
day
pronounced
before
Elena
She
felt
that
she
reddened
she
realised
at
the
same
time
that
she
ought
to
express
regret
at
the
sudden
departure
of
such
a
pleasant
acquaintance
but
she
could
not
force
herself
to
hypocrisy
and
continued
to
sit
without
stirring
or
speaking
while
Anna
Vassilyevna
sighed
and
lamented
Elena
tried
to
keep
near
Bersenyev
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
though
he
even
knew
part
of
her
secret
she
was
safe
under
his
wing
from
Shubin
who
still
persisted
in
staring
at
her
not
mockingly
but
attentively
Bersenyev
too
was
thrown
into
perplexity
during
the
evening
he
had
expected
to
see
Elena
more
gloomy
Happily
for
her
an
argument
sprang
up
about
art
between
him
and
Shubin
she
moved
apart
and
heard
their
voices
as
it
were
through
a
dream
By
degrees
not
only
they
but
the
whole
room
everything
surrounding
her
seemed
like
a
dream
everything
the
samovar
on
the
table
and
Uvar
Ivanovitch
s
short
waistcoat
and
Zoya
s
polished
finger-nails
and
the
portrait
in
oils
of
the
Grand
Duke
Constantine
Pavlovitch
on
the
wall
everything
retreated
everything
was
wrapped
in
mist
everything
ceased
to
exist
Only
she
felt
sorry
for
them
all
What
are
they
living
for
she
thought
Are
you
sleepy
Lenotchka
her
mother
asked
her
She
did
not
hear
the
question
A
half
untrue
insinuation
do
you
say
These
words
sharply
uttered
by
Shubin
suddenly
awakened
Elena
s
attention
Why
he
continued
the
whole
sting
lies
in
that
A
true
insinuation
makes
one
wretched
that
s
unchristian
and
to
an
untrue
insinuation
a
man
is
indifferent
that
s
stupid
but
at
a
half
true
one
he
feels
vexed
and
impatient
For
instance
if
I
say
that
Elena
Nikolaevna
is
in
love
with
one
of
us
what
sort
of
insinuation
would
that
be
eh
Ah
Monsieur
Paul
said
Elena
I
should
like
to
show
myself
vexed
but
really
I
can
t
I
am
so
tired
Why
don
t
you
go
to
bed
observed
Anna
Vassilyevna
who
was
always
drowsy
in
the
evening
herself
and
consequently
always
eager
to
send
the
others
to
bed
Say
good-night
to
me
and
go
in
God
s
name
Andrei
Petrovitch
will
excuse
you
Elena
kissed
her
mother
bowed
to
all
and
went
away
Shubin
accompanied
her
to
the
door
Elena
Nikolaevna
he
whispered
to
her
in
the
doorway
you
trample
on
Monsieur
Paul
you
mercilessly
walk
over
him
but
Monsieur
Paul
blesses
you
and
your
little
feet
and
the
slippers
on
your
little
feet
and
the
soles
of
your
little
slippers
Elena
shrugged
her
shoulders
reluctantly
held
out
her
hand
to
him
not
the
one
Insarov
had
kissed
and
going
up
to
her
room
at
once
undressed
got
into
bed
and
fell
asleep
She
slept
a
deep
unstirring
sleep
as
even
children
rarely
sleep
the
sleep
of
a
child
convalescent
after
sickness
when
its
mother
sits
near
its
cradle
and
watches
it
and
listens
to
its
breathing
Come
to
my
room
for
a
minute
Shubin
said
to
Bersenyev
directly
the
latter
had
taken
leave
of
Anna
Vassilyevna
I
have
something
to
show
you
Bersenyev
followed
him
to
his
attic
He
was
surprised
to
see
a
number
of
studies
statuettes
and
busts
covered
with
damp
cloths
set
about
in
all
the
corners
of
the
room
Well
I
see
you
have
been
at
work
in
earnest
he
observed
to
Shubin
One
must
do
something
he
answered
If
one
thing
doesn
t
do
one
must
try
another
However
like
a
true
Corsican
I
am
more
concerned
with
revenge
than
with
pure
art
Trema
Bisanzia
I
don
t
understand
you
said
Bersenyev
Well
wait
a
minute
Deign
to
look
this
way
gracious
friend
and
benefactor
my
vengeance
number
one
Shubin
uncovered
one
figure
and
Bersenyev
saw
a
capital
bust
of
Insarov
an
excellent
likeness
The
features
of
the
face
had
been
correctly
caught
by
Shubin
to
the
minutest
detail
and
he
had
given
him
a
fine
expression
honest
generous
and
bold
Bersenyev
went
into
raptures
over
it
That
s
simply
exquisite
he
cried
I
congratulate
you
You
must
send
it
to
the
exhibition
Why
do
you
call
that
magnificent
work
your
vengeance
Because
sir
I
intended
to
offer
this
magnificent
work
as
you
call
it
to
Elena
Nikolaevna
on
her
name
day
Do
you
see
the
allegory
We
are
not
blind
we
see
what
goes
on
about
us
but
we
are
gentlemen
my
dear
sir
and
we
take
our
revenge
like
gentlemen
But
here
added
Shubin
uncovering
another
figure
as
the
artist
according
to
modern
aesthetic
principles
enjoys
the
enviable
privilege
of
embodying
in
himself
every
sort
of
baseness
which
he
can
turn
into
a
gem
of
creative
art
we
in
the
production
of
this
gem
number
two
have
taken
vengeance
not
as
gentlemen
but
simply
en
canaille
He
deftly
drew
off
the
cloth
and
displayed
to
Bersenyev
s
eyes
a
statuette
in
Dantan
s
style
also
of
Insarov
Anything
cleverer
and
more
spiteful
could
not
be
imagined
The
young
Bulgarian
was
represented
as
a
ram
standing
on
his
hind-legs
butting
forward
with
his
horns
Dull
solemnity
and
aggressiveness
obstinacy
clumsiness
and
narrowness
were
simply
printed
on
the
visage
of
the
sire
of
the
woolly
flock
and
yet
the
likeness
to
Insarov
was
so
striking
that
Bersenyev
could
not
help
laughing
Eh
is
it
amusing
said
Shubin
Do
you
recognise
the
hero
Do
you
advise
me
to
send
it
too
to
the
exhibition
That
my
dear
fellow
I
intend
as
a
present
for
myself
on
my
own
name
day
Your
honour
will
permit
me
to
play
the
fool
And
Shubin
gave
three
little
leaps
kicking
himself
behind
with
his
heels
Bersenyev
picked
up
the
cloth
off
the
floor
and
threw
it
over
the
statuette
Ah
you
magnanimous
began
Shubin
Who
the
devil
was
it
in
history
was
so
particularly
magnanimous
Well
never
mind
And
now
he
continued
with
melancholy
triumph
uncovering
a
third
rather
large
mass
of
clay
you
shall
behold
something
which
will
show
you
the
humility
and
discernment
of
your
friend
You
will
realise
that
he
like
a
true
artist
again
feels
the
need
and
the
use
of
self-castigation
Behold
The
cloth
was
lifted
and
Bersenyev
saw
two
heads
modelled
side
by
side
and
close
as
though
growing
together
He
did
not
at
once
know
what
was
the
subject
but
looking
closer
he
recognised
in
one
of
them
Annushka
in
the
other
Shubin
himself
They
were
however
rather
caricatures
than
portraits
Annushka
was
represented
as
a
handsome
fat
girl
with
a
low
forehead
eyes
lost
in
layers
of
fat
and
a
saucily
turned-up
nose
Her
thick
lips
had
an
insolent
curve
her
whole
face
expressed
sensuality
carelessness
and
boldness
not
without
goodnature
Himself
Shubin
had
modelled
as
a
lean
emaciated
rake
with
sunken
cheeks
his
thin
hair
hanging
in
weak
wisps
about
his
face
a
meaningless
expression
in
his
dim
eyes
and
his
nose
sharp
and
thin
as
a
dead
man
s
Bersenyev
turned
away
with
disgust
A
nice
pair
aren
t
they
my
dear
fellow
said
Shubin
won
t
you
graciously
compose
a
suitable
title
For
the
first
two
I
have
already
thought
of
titles
On
the
bust
shall
be
inscribed
A
hero
resolving
to
liberate
his
country
On
the
statuette
Look
out
sausage-eating
Germans
And
for
this
work
what
do
you
think
of
The
future
of
the
artist
Pavel
Yakovlitch
Shubin
Will
that
do
Leave
off
replied
Bersenyev
Was
it
worth
while
to
waste
your
time
on
such
a
He
could
not
at
once
fix
on
a
suitable
word
Disgusting
thing
you
mean
No
my
dear
fellow
excuse
me
if
anything
ought
to
go
to
the
exhibition
it
s
that
group
It
s
simply
disgusting
repeated
Bersenyev
And
besides
it
s
nonsense
You
have
absolutely
no
such
degrading
tendencies
to
which
unhappily
our
artists
have
such
a
frequent
bent
You
have
simply
libelled
yourself
Do
you
think
so
said
Shubin
gloomily
I
have
none
of
them
and
if
they
come
upon
me
the
fault
is
all
one
person
s
Do
you
know
he
added
tragically
knitting
his
brows
that
I
have
been
trying
drinking
Nonsense
Yes
I
have
by
God
rejoined
Shubin
and
suddenly
grinning
and
brightening
but
I
didn
t
like
it
my
dear
boy
the
stuff
sticks
in
my
throat
and
my
head
afterwards
is
a
perfect
drum
The
great
Lushtchihin
himself
Harlampy
Lushtchihin
the
greatest
drunkard
in
Moscow
and
a
Great
Russian
drunkard
too
declared
there
was
nothing
to
be
made
of
me
In
his
words
the
bottle
does
not
speak
to
me
Bersenyev
was
just
going
to
knock
the
group
over
but
Shubin
stopped
him
That
ll
do
my
dear
boy
don
t
smash
it
it
will
serve
as
a
lesson
a
scare-crow
Bersenyev
laughed
If
that
s
what
it
is
I
will
spare
your
scarecrow
then
he
said
And
now
Long
live
eternal
true
art
Long
live
true
art
put
in
Shubin
By
art
the
good
is
better
and
the
bad
is
not
all
loss
The
friends
shook
hands
warmly
and
parted
Elena
s
first
sensation
on
awakening
was
one
of
happy
consternation
Is
it
possible
Is
it
possible
she
asked
herself
and
her
heart
grew
faint
with
happiness
Recollections
came
rushing
on
her
she
was
overwhelmed
by
them
Then
again
she
was
enfolded
by
the
blissful
peace
of
triumph
But
in
the
course
of
the
morning
Elena
gradually
became
possessed
by
a
spirit
of
unrest
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
she
felt
listless
and
weary
It
was
true
she
knew
now
what
she
wanted
but
that
made
it
no
easier
for
her
That
never-to-be
forgotten
meeting
had
cast
her
for
ever
out
of
the
old
groove
she
was
no
longer
at
the
same
standpoint
she
was
far
away
and
yet
everything
went
on
about
her
in
its
accustomed
order
everything
pursued
its
own
course
as
though
nothing
were
changed
the
old
life
moved
on
its
old
way
reckoning
on
Elena
s
interest
and
co-operation
as
of
old
She
tried
to
begin
a
letter
to
Insarov
but
that
too
was
a
failure
the
words
came
on
to
paper
either
lifeless
or
false
Her
diary
she
had
put
an
end
to
by
drawing
a
thick
stroke
under
the
last
line
That
was
the
past
and
every
thought
all
her
soul
was
turned
now
to
the
future
Her
heart
was
heavy
To
sit
with
her
mother
who
suspected
nothing
to
listen
to
her
answer
her
and
talk
to
her
seemed
to
Elena
something
wicked
she
felt
the
presence
of
a
kind
of
falseness
in
her
she
suffered
though
she
had
nothing
to
blush
for
more
than
once
an
almost
irresistible
desire
sprang
up
in
her
heart
to
tell
everything
without
reserve
whatever
might
come
of
it
afterwards
Why
she
thought
did
not
Dmitri
take
me
away
then
from
that
little
chapel
wherever
he
wanted
to
go
Didn
t
he
tell
me
I
was
his
wife
before
God
What
am
I
here
for
She
suddenly
began
to
feel
shy
of
every
one
even
of
Uvar
Ivanovitch
who
was
flourishing
his
fingers
in
more
perplexity
than
ever
Now
everything
about
her
seemed
neither
sweet
nor
friendly
nor
even
a
dream
but
like
a
nightmare
lay
an
immovable
dead
load
on
her
heart
seeming
to
reproach
her
and
be
indignant
with
her
and
not
to
care
to
know
about
her
You
are
ours
in
spite
of
everything
she
seemed
to
hear
Even
her
poor
pets
her
ill-used
birds
and
animals
looked
at
her
so
at
least
she
fancied
with
suspicion
and
hostility
She
felt
conscience-stricken
and
ashamed
of
her
feelings
This
is
my
home
after
all
she
thought
my
family
my
country
No
it
s
no
longer
your
country
nor
your
family
another
voice
affirmed
within
her
Terror
was
overmastering
her
and
she
was
vexed
with
her
own
feebleness
The
trial
was
only
beginning
and
she
was
losing
patience
already
Was
this
what
she
had
promised
She
did
not
soon
gain
control
of
herself
But
a
week
passed
and
then
another
Elena
became
a
little
calmer
and
grew
used
to
her
new
position
She
wrote
two
little
notes
to
Insarov
and
carried
them
herself
to
the
post
she
could
not
for
anything
through
shame
and
through
pride
have
brought
herself
to
confide
in
a
maid
She
was
already
beginning
to
expect
him
in
person
But
instead
of
Insarov
one
fine
morning
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
made
his
appearance
No
one
in
the
house
of
the
retired
lieutenant
of
guards
Stahov
had
ever
seen
him
so
sour
and
at
the
same
time
so
self-confident
and
important
as
on
that
day
He
walked
into
the
drawing-room
in
his
overcoat
and
hat
with
long
deliberate
stride
stamping
with
his
heels
he
approached
the
looking-glass
and
took
a
long
look
at
himself
shaking
his
head
and
biting
his
lips
with
imperturbable
severity
Anna
Vassilyevna
met
him
with
obvious
agitation
and
secret
delight
she
never
met
him
otherwise
he
did
not
even
take
off
his
hat
nor
greet
her
and
in
silence
gave
Elena
his
doe-skin
glove
to
kiss
Anna
Vassilyevna
began
questioning
him
about
the
progress
of
his
cure
he
made
her
no
reply
Uvar
Ivanovitch
made
his
appearance
he
glanced
at
him
and
said
bah
He
usually
behaved
coldly
and
haughtily
to
Uvar
Ivanovitch
though
he
acknowledged
in
him
traces
of
the
true
Stahov
blood
Almost
all
Russian
families
of
the
nobility
are
convinced
as
is
well
known
of
the
existence
of
exceptional
hereditary
characteristics
peculiar
to
them
alone
we
have
more
than
once
heard
discussions
among
ourselves
of
the
Podsalaskinsky
noses
and
the
Perepreyevsky
necks
Zoya
came
in
and
sat
down
facing
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
He
grunted
sank
into
an
armchair
asked
for
coffee
and
only
then
took
off
his
hat
Coffee
was
brought
him
he
drank
a
cup
and
looking
at
everybody
in
turn
he
growled
between
his
teeth
Sortes
s
il
vous
plait
and
turning
to
his
wife
he
added
et
vous
madame
restez
je
vous
prie
They
all
left
the
room
except
Anna
Vassilyevna
Her
head
was
trembling
with
agitation
The
solemnity
of
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
s
preparations
impressed
her
She
was
expecting
something
extraordinary
What
is
it
she
cried
directly
the
door
was
closed
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
flung
an
indifferent
glance
at
Anna
Vassilyevna
Nothing
special
what
a
way
you
have
of
assuming
the
air
of
a
victim
at
once
he
began
quite
needlessly
dropping
the
corners
of
his
mouth
at
every
word
I
only
want
to
forewarn
you
that
we
shall
have
a
new
guest
dining
here
to-day
Who
is
it
Kurnatovsky
Yegor
Andreyevitch
You
don
t
know
him
The
head
secretary
in
the
senate
He
is
to
dine
with
us
to-day
Yes
And
was
it
only
to
tell
me
this
that
you
made
every
one
go
away
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
again
flung
a
glance
this
time
one
of
irony
at
Anna
Vassilyevna
Does
that
surprise
you
Defer
your
surprise
a
little
He
ceased
speaking
Anna
Vassilyevna
too
was
silent
for
a
little
time
I
could
have
wished
she
was
beginning
I
know
you
have
always
looked
on
me
as
an
immoral
man
began
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
suddenly
I
muttered
Anna
Vassilyevna
astounded
And
very
likely
you
are
right
I
don
t
wish
to
deny
that
I
have
in
fact
sometimes
given
you
just
grounds
for
dissatisfaction
my
greys
flashed
through
Anna
Vassilyevna
s
head
though
you
must
yourself
allow
that
in
the
condition
as
you
are
aware
of
your
constitution
And
I
make
no
complaint
against
you
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
C
est
possible
In
any
case
I
have
no
intention
of
justifying
myself
Time
will
justify
me
But
I
regard
it
as
my
duty
to
prove
to
you
that
I
understand
my
duties
and
know
how
to
care
for
for
the
welfare
of
the
family
entrusted
entrusted
to
me
What
s
the
meaning
of
all
this
Anna
Vassilyevna
was
thinking
She
could
not
guess
that
the
preceding
evening
at
the
English
club
a
discussion
had
arisen
in
a
corner
of
the
smoking-room
as
to
the
incapacity
of
Russians
to
make
speeches
Which
of
us
can
speak
Mention
any
one
one
of
the
disputants
had
exclaimed
Well
Stahov
for
instance
had
answered
the
other
pointing
to
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
who
stood
up
on
the
spot
almost
squealing
with
delight
For
instance
pursued
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
my
daughter
Elena
Don
t
you
consider
that
the
time
has
come
for
her
to
take
a
decisive
step
along
the
path
to
be
married
I
mean
to
say
All
these
intellectual
and
philanthropic
pursuits
are
all
very
well
but
only
up
to
a
certain
point
up
to
a
certain
age
It
s
time
for
her
to
drop
her
mistiness
to
get
out
of
the
society
of
all
these
artists
scholars
and
Montenegrins
and
do
like
everybody
else
How
am
I
to
understand
you
asked
Anna
Vassilyevna
Well
if
you
will
kindly
listen
answered
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
still
with
the
same
dropping
of
the
corners
of
his
lips
I
will
tell
you
plainly
without
beating
about
the
bush
I
have
made
acquaintance
I
have
become
intimate
with
this
young
man
Mr
Kurnatovsky
in
the
hope
of
having
him
for
a
son-in-law
I
venture
to
think
that
when
you
see
him
you
will
not
accuse
me
of
partiality
or
precipitate
judgment
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
was
admiring
his
own
eloquence
as
he
talked
Of
excellent
education
educated
in
the
highest
legal
college
excellent
manners
thirty-three
years
old
and
upper-secretary
a
councillor
and
a
Stanislas
cross
on
his
neck
You
I
hope
will
do
me
the
justice
to
allow
that
I
do
not
belong
to
the
number
of
those
peres
de
famille
who
are
mad
for
position
but
you
yourself
told
me
that
Elena
Nikolaevna
likes
practical
business
men
Yegor
Andreyevitch
is
in
the
first
place
a
business
man
now
on
the
other
side
my
daughter
has
a
weakness
for
generous
actions
so
let
me
tell
you
that
Yegor
Andreyevitch
directly
he
had
attained
the
possibility
you
understand
me
the
possibility
of
living
without
privation
on
his
salary
at
once
gave
up
the
yearly
income
assigned
him
by
his
father
for
the
benefit
of
his
brothers
Who
is
his
father
inquired
Anna
Vassilyevna
His
father
His
father
is
a
man
well-known
in
his
own
line
of
the
highest
moral
character
un
vrai
stoicien
a
retired
major
I
think
overseer
of
all
the
estates
of
the
Count
B
Ah
observed
Anna
Vassilyevna
Ah
why
ah
interposed
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
Can
you
be
infected
with
prejudice
Why
I
said
nothing
Anna
Vassilyevna
was
beginning
No
you
said
ah
However
that
may
be
I
have
thought
it
well
to
acquaint
you
with
my
way
of
thinking
and
I
venture
to
think
I
venture
to
hope
Mr
Kurnatovsky
will
be
received
a
bras
ouverts
He
is
no
Montenegrin
vagrant
Of
course
I
need
only
call
Vanka
the
cook
and
order
a
few
extra
dishes
You
are
aware
that
I
will
not
enter
into
that
said
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
and
he
got
up
put
on
his
hat
and
whistling
he
had
heard
some
one
say
that
whistling
was
only
permissible
in
a
country
villa
and
a
riding
court
went
out
for
a
stroll
in
the
garden
Shubin
watched
him
out
of
the
little
window
of
his
lodge
and
in
silence
put
out
his
tongue
at
him
At
ten
minutes
to
four
a
hackney-carriage
drove
up
to
the
steps
of
the
Stahovs
s
villa
and
a
man
still
young
of
prepossessing
appearance
simply
and
elegantly
dressed
stepped
out
of
it
and
sent
up
his
name
This
was
Yegor
Andreyevitch
Kurnatovsky
This
was
what
among
other
things
Elena
wrote
next
day
to
Insarov
Congratulate
me
dear
Dmitri
I
have
a
suitor
He
dined
with
us
yesterday
papa
made
his
acquaintance
at
the
English
club
I
fancy
and
invited
him
Of
course
he
did
not
come
yesterday
as
a
suitor
But
good
mamma
to
whom
papa
had
made
known
his
hopes
whispered
in
my
ear
what
this
guest
was
His
name
is
Yegor
Andreyevitch
Kurnatovsky
he
is
upper-secretary
to
the
Senate
I
will
first
describe
to
you
his
appearance
He
is
of
medium
height
shorter
than
you
and
a
good
figure
his
features
are
regular
he
is
close-cropped
and
wears
large
whiskers
His
eyes
are
rather
small
like
yours
brown
and
quick
he
has
a
flat
wide
mouth
in
his
eyes
and
on
his
lips
there
is
a
perpetual
sort
of
official
smile
it
seems
to
be
always
on
duty
there
He
behaves
very
simply
and
speaks
precisely
and
everything
about
him
is
precise
he
moves
laughs
and
eats
as
though
he
were
doing
a
duty
How
carefully
she
has
studied
him
you
are
thinking
perhaps
at
this
minute
Yes
so
as
to
be
able
to
describe
him
to
you
And
besides
who
wouldn
t
study
her
suitor
There
s
something
of
iron
in
him
and
dull
and
empty
at
the
same
time
and
honest
they
say
he
is
really
very
honest
You
too
are
made
of
iron
but
not
like
this
man
At
dinner
he
sat
next
me
and
facing
us
sat
Shubin
At
first
the
conversation
turned
on
commercial
undertakings
they
say
he
is
very
clever
in
business
matters
and
was
almost
throwing
up
his
government
post
to
take
charge
of
a
large
manufacturing
business
Pity
he
didn
t
do
it
Then
Shubin
began
to
talk
about
the
theatre
Mr
Kurnatovsky
declared
and
I
must
confess
without
false
modesty
that
he
has
no
ideas
about
art
That
reminded
me
of
you
but
I
thought
no
Dmitri
and
I
are
ignorant
of
art
in
a
very
different
way
though
This
man
seemed
to
mean
I
know
nothing
of
it
and
it
s
quite
superfluous
still
it
may
be
admitted
in
a
well-ordered
state
He
seems
however
to
think
very
little
about
Petersburg
and
comme
il
faut
he
once
even
called
himself
one
of
the
proletariat
We
are
working
people
he
said
I
thought
if
Dmitri
had
said
that
I
shouldn
t
have
liked
it
but
he
may
talk
about
himself
he
may
boast
if
he
likes
With
me
he
is
very
attentive
but
I
kept
feeling
that
a
very
very
condescending
superior
was
talking
with
me
When
he
means
to
praise
any
one
he
says
So-and-so
is
a
man
of
principle
that
s
his
favourite
word
He
seems
to
be
self-confident
hardworking
capable
of
self-sacrifice
you
see
I
am
impartial
that
s
to
say
of
sacrificing
his
own
interest
but
he
is
a
great
despot
It
would
be
woeful
to
fall
into
his
power
At
dinner
they
began
talking
about
bribes
I
know
he
said
that
in
many
cases
the
man
who
accepts
a
bribe
is
not
to
blame
he
can
not
do
otherwise
Still
if
he
is
found
out
he
must
be
punished
without
mercy
I
cried
Punish
an
innocent
man
Yes
for
the
sake
of
principle
What
principle
asked
Shubin
Kurnatovsky
seemed
annoyed
or
surprised
and
said
That
needs
no
explanation
Papa
who
seems
to
worship
him
put
in
of
course
not
and
to
my
vexation
the
conversation
stopped
there
In
the
evening
Bersenyev
came
and
got
into
a
terrific
argument
with
him
I
have
never
seen
our
good
Andrei
Petrovitch
so
excited
Mr
Kurnatovsky
did
not
at
all
deny
the
utility
of
science
universities
and
so
on
but
still
I
understood
Andrei
Petrovitch
s
indignation
The
man
looks
at
it
all
as
a
sort
of
gymnastics
Shubin
came
up
to
me
after
dinner
and
said
This
fellow
here
and
some
one
else
he
can
never
bring
himself
to
utter
your
name
are
both
practical
men
but
see
what
a
difference
there
s
the
real
living
ideal
given
to
life
and
here
there
s
not
even
a
feeling
of
duty
simply
official
honesty
and
activity
without
anything
inside
it
Shubin
is
clever
and
I
remembered
his
words
to
tell
you
but
to
my
mind
there
is
nothing
in
common
between
you
You
have
faith
and
he
has
not
for
a
man
can
not
have
faith
in
himself
only
He
did
not
go
away
till
late
but
mamma
had
time
to
inform
me
that
he
was
pleased
with
me
and
papa
is
in
ecstasies
Did
he
say
I
wonder
that
I
was
a
woman
of
principle
I
was
almost
telling
mamma
that
I
was
very
sorry
but
I
had
a
husband
already
Why
is
it
papa
dislikes
you
so
Mamma
we
could
soon
manage
to
bring
round
Oh
my
dear
one
I
have
described
this
gentleman
in
such
detail
to
deaden
my
heartache
I
don
t
live
without
you
I
am
constantly
seeing
you
hearing
you
I
look
forward
to
seeing
you
only
not
at
our
house
as
you
intended
fancy
how
wretched
and
ill
at
ease
we
should
be
but
you
know
where
I
wrote
to
you
in
that
wood
Oh
my
dear
one
How
I
love
you
Three
weeks
after
Kurnatovsky
s
first
visit
Anna
Vassilyevna
to
Elena
s
great
delight
returned
to
Moscow
to
her
large
wooden
house
near
Prechistenka
a
house
with
columns
white
lyres
and
wreaths
over
every
window
with
an
attic
offices
a
palisade
a
huge
green
court
a
well
in
the
court
and
a
dog
s
kennel
near
the
well
Anna
Vassilyevna
had
never
left
her
country
villa
so
early
but
this
year
with
the
first
autumn
chills
her
face
swelled
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
for
his
part
having
finished
his
cure
began
to
want
his
wife
besides
Augustina
Christianovna
had
gone
away
on
a
visit
to
her
cousin
in
Revel
a
family
of
foreigners
known
as
living
statues
des
poses
plastiques
had
come
to
Moscow
and
the
description
of
them
in
the
Moscow
Gazette
had
aroused
Anna
Vassilyevna
s
liveliest
curiosity
In
short
to
stay
longer
at
the
villa
seemed
inconvenient
and
even
in
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
s
words
incompatible
with
the
fulfilment
of
his
cherished
projects
The
last
fortnight
seemed
very
long
to
Elena
Kurnatovsky
came
over
twice
on
Sundays
on
other
days
he
was
busy
He
came
really
to
see
Elena
but
talked
more
to
Zoya
who
was
much
pleased
with
him
Das
ist
ein
Mann
she
thought
to
herself
as
she
looked
at
his
full
manly
face
and
listened
to
his
self-confident
condescending
talk
To
her
mind
no
one
had
such
a
wonderful
voice
no
one
could
pronounce
so
nicely
I
had
the
hon-our
or
I
am
most
de-lighted
Insarov
did
not
come
to
the
Stahovs
but
Elena
saw
him
once
in
secret
in
a
little
copse
by
the
Moskva
river
where
she
arranged
to
meet
him
They
hardly
had
time
to
say
more
than
a
few
words
to
each
other
Shubin
returned
to
Moscow
with
Anna
Vassilyevna
Bersenyev
a
few
days
later
Insarov
was
sitting
in
his
room
and
for
the
third
time
looking
through
the
letters
brought
him
from
Bulgaria
by
hand
they
were
afraid
to
send
them
by
post
He
was
much
disturbed
by
them
Events
were
developing
rapidly
in
the
East
the
occupation
of
the
Principalities
by
Russian
troops
had
thrown
all
men
s
minds
into
a
ferment
the
storm
was
growing
already
could
be
felt
the
breath
of
approaching
inevitable
war
The
fire
was
kindling
all
round
and
no
one
could
foresee
how
far
it
would
go
where
it
would
stop
Old
wrongs
long
cherished
hopes
all
were
astir
again
Insarov
s
heart
throbbed
eagerly
his
hopes
too
were
being
realised
But
is
it
not
too
soon
will
it
not
be
in
vain
he
thought
tightly
clasping
his
hands
We
are
not
ready
but
so
be
it
I
must
go
Something
rustled
lightly
at
the
door
it
flew
quickly
open
and
into
the
room
ran
Elena
Insarov
all
in
a
tremor
rushed
to
her
fell
on
his
knees
before
her
clasped
her
waist
and
pressed
it
close
against
his
head
You
didn
t
expect
me
she
said
hardly
able
to
draw
her
breath
she
had
run
quickly
up
the
stairs
Dear
one
dear
one
so
this
is
where
you
live
I
ve
quickly
found
you
The
daughter
of
your
landlord
conducted
me
We
arrived
the
day
before
yesterday
I
meant
to
write
to
you
but
I
thought
I
had
better
come
myself
I
have
come
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Get
up
shut
the
door
He
got
up
quickly
shut
the
door
returned
to
her
and
took
her
by
the
