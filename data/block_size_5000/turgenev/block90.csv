often
laughed
and
in
a
very
strange
way
she
seemed
to
laugh
not
at
what
she
heard
but
at
the
different
ideas
that
crossed
her
mind
Her
big
eyes
looked
out
boldly
brightly
directly
but
sometimes
her
eyelids
faintly
drooped
and
then
their
expression
instantaneously
became
deep
and
tender
We
chatted
away
for
a
couple
of
hours
The
daylight
had
long
died
away
and
the
evening
glow
at
first
fiery
then
clear
and
red
then
pale
and
dim
had
slowly
melted
away
and
passed
into
night
but
our
conversation
still
went
on
as
quiet
and
peaceful
as
the
air
around
us
Gagin
ordered
a
bottle
of
Rhine
wine
we
drank
it
between
us
slowly
and
deliberately
The
music
floated
across
to
us
as
before
its
strains
seemed
sweeter
and
tenderer
lights
were
burning
in
the
town
and
on
the
river
Acia
suddenly
let
her
head
fall
so
that
her
curls
dropped
into
her
eyes
ceased
speaking
and
sighed
Then
she
said
she
was
sleepy
and
went
indoors
I
saw
though
that
she
stood
a
long
while
at
the
unopened
window
without
lighting
a
candle
At
last
the
moon
rose
and
began
shining
upon
the
Rhine
everything
turned
to
light
and
darkness
everything
was
transformed
even
the
wine
in
our
cut-glass
tumblers
gleamed
with
a
mysterious
light
The
wind
drooped
as
it
were
folded
its
wings
and
sank
to
rest
the
fragrant
warmth
of
night
rose
in
whiffs
from
the
earth
It
s
time
I
was
going
I
cried
or
else
perhaps
there
ll
be
no
getting
a
ferryman
Yes
it
s
time
to
start
Gagin
assented
We
went
down
the
path
Suddenly
we
heard
the
rolling
of
the
stones
behind
us
it
was
Acia
coming
after
us
Aren
t
you
asleep
asked
her
brother
but
without
answering
a
word
she
ran
by
us
The
last
smouldering
lamps
lighted
by
the
students
in
the
garden
of
the
inn
threw
a
light
on
the
leaves
of
the
trees
from
below
giving
them
a
fantastic
and
festive
look
We
found
Acia
at
the
river
s
edge
she
was
talking
to
a
ferryman
I
jumped
into
the
boat
and
said
good-bye
to
my
new
friends
Gagin
promised
to
pay
me
a
visit
next
day
I
pressed
his
hand
and
held
out
my
hand
to
Acia
but
she
only
looked
at
me
and
shook
her
head
The
boat
pushed
off
and
floated
on
the
rapid
river
The
ferryman
a
sturdy
old
man
buried
his
oars
in
the
dark
water
and
pulled
with
great
effort
You
are
in
the
streak
of
moonlight
you
have
broken
it
up
Acia
shouted
to
me
I
dropped
my
eyes
the
waters
eddied
round
the
boat
blacker
than
ever
Good-bye
I
heard
her
voice
Till
to-morrow
Gagin
said
after
her
The
boat
reached
the
other
side
I
got
out
and
looked
about
me
No
one
could
be
seen
now
on
the
opposite
bank
The
streak
of
moonlight
stretched
once
more
like
a
bridge
of
gold
right
across
the
river
Like
a
farewell
the
air
of
the
old-fashioned
Lanner
waltz
drifted
across
Gagin
was
right
I
felt
every
chord
in
my
heart
vibrating
in
response
to
its
seductive
melody
I
started
homewards
across
the
darkening
fields
drinking
in
slowly
the
fragrant
air
and
reached
my
room
deeply
stirred
by
the
voluptuous
languor
of
vague
endless
anticipation
I
felt
happy
But
why
was
I
happy
I
desired
nothing
I
thought
of
nothing
I
was
happy
Almost
laughing
from
excess
of
sweet
light-hearted
emotions
I
dived
into
my
bed
and
was
just
closing
my
eyes
when
all
at
once
it
struck
me
that
I
had
not
once
all
the
evening
remembered
my
cruel
charmer
What
s
the
meaning
of
it
I
wondered
to
myself
is
it
possible
I
m
not
in
love
But
though
I
asked
myself
this
question
I
fell
asleep
I
think
at
once
like
a
baby
in
its
cradle
Next
morning
I
was
awake
but
had
not
yet
begun
to
get
up
I
heard
the
tap
of
a
stick
on
my
window
and
a
voice
I
knew
at
once
for
Gagin
s
hummed
Art
thou
asleep
with
the
guitar
Will
I
awaken
thee
I
made
haste
to
open
the
door
to
him
Good-morning
said
Gagin
coming
in
I
m
disturbing
you
rather
early
but
only
see
what
a
morning
it
is
Fresh
dewy
larks
singing
With
his
curly
shining
hair
his
open
neck
and
rosy
cheeks
he
was
fresh
as
the
morning
himself
I
dressed
we
went
out
into
the
garden
sat
down
on
a
bench
ordered
coffee
and
proceeded
to
talk
Gagin
told
me
his
plans
for
the
future
he
possessed
a
moderate
fortune
was
not
dependent
on
any
one
and
wanted
to
devote
himself
to
painting
He
only
regretted
that
he
had
not
had
more
sense
sooner
but
had
wasted
so
much
time
doing
nothing
I
too
referred
to
my
projects
and
incidentally
confided
to
him
the
secret
of
my
unhappy
love
He
listened
to
me
amiably
but
so
far
as
I
could
observe
I
did
not
arouse
in
him
any
very
strong
sympathy
with
my
passion
Sighing
once
or
twice
after
me
for
civility
s
sake
Gagin
suggested
that
I
should
go
home
with
him
and
look
at
his
sketches
I
agreed
at
once
We
did
not
find
Acia
She
had
the
landlady
told
us
gone
to
the
ruin
A
mile
and
a
half
from
L
were
the
remains
of
a
feudal
castle
Gagin
showed
me
all
his
canvases
In
his
sketches
there
was
a
good
deal
of
life
and
truth
a
certain
breadth
and
freedom
but
not
one
of
them
was
finished
and
the
drawing
struck
me
as
careless
and
incorrect
I
gave
candid
expression
to
my
opinion
Yes
yes
he
assented
with
a
sigh
you
re
right
it
s
all
very
poor
and
crude
what
s
to
be
done
I
haven
t
had
the
training
I
ought
to
have
had
besides
one
s
cursed
Slavonic
slackness
gets
the
better
of
one
While
one
dreams
of
work
one
soars
away
in
eagle
flight
one
fancies
one
s
going
to
shake
the
earth
out
of
its
place
but
when
it
comes
to
doing
anything
one
s
weak
and
weary
directly
I
began
trying
to
cheer
him
up
but
he
waved
me
off
and
bundling
his
sketches
up
together
threw
them
on
the
sofa
If
I
ve
patience
something
may
be
made
of
me
he
muttered
if
I
haven
t
I
shall
remain
a
half-baked
noble
amateur
Come
we
d
better
be
looking
for
Acia
We
went
out
The
road
to
the
ruin
went
twisting
down
the
steep
incline
into
a
narrow
wooded
valley
at
the
bottom
ran
a
stream
noisily
threading
its
way
through
the
pebbles
as
though
in
haste
to
flow
into
the
great
river
peacefully
shining
beyond
the
dark
ridge
of
the
deep
indented
mountain
crest
Gagin
called
my
attention
to
some
places
where
the
light
fell
specially
finely
one
could
see
in
his
words
that
even
if
not
a
painter
he
was
undoubtedly
an
artist
The
ruin
soon
came
into
sight
On
the
very
summit
of
the
naked
rock
rose
a
square
tower
black
all
over
still
strong
but
as
it
were
cleft
in
two
by
a
longitudinal
crack
Mossy
walls
adjoined
the
tower
here
and
there
ivy
clung
about
it
wind-twisted
bushes
hung
down
from
the
grey
battlements
and
crumbling
arches
A
stray
path
led
up
to
the
gates
still
standing
entire
We
had
just
reached
them
when
suddenly
a
girl
s
figure
darted
up
in
front
of
us
ran
swiftly
over
a
heap
of
debris
and
stood
on
the
projecting
part
of
the
wall
right
over
the
precipice
Why
it
s
Acia
cried
Gagin
the
mad
thing
We
went
through
the
gates
and
found
ourselves
in
a
small
courtyard
half
overgrown
with
crab-apple
trees
and
nettles
On
the
projecting
ledge
Acia
actually
was
sitting
She
turned
and
faced
us
laughing
but
did
not
move
Gagin
shook
his
finger
at
her
while
I
loudly
reproached
her
for
her
recklessness
That
s
enough
Gagin
said
to
me
in
a
whisper
don
t
tease
her
you
don
t
know
what
she
is
she
d
very
likely
climb
right
up
on
to
the
tower
Look
you
d
better
be
admiring
the
intelligence
of
the
people
of
these
parts
I
looked
round
In
a
corner
ensconced
in
a
tiny
wooden
hut
an
old
woman
was
knitting
a
stocking
and
looking
at
us
through
her
spectacles
She
sold
beer
gingerbread
and
seltzer
water
to
tourists
We
seated
ourselves
on
a
bench
and
began
drinking
some
fairly
cold
beer
out
of
heavy
pewter
pots
Acia
still
sat
without
moving
with
her
feet
tucked
under
her
and
a
muslin
scarf
wrapped
round
her
head
her
graceful
figure
stood
out
distinctly
and
finely
against
the
clear
sky
but
I
looked
at
her
with
a
feeling
of
hostility
The
evening
before
I
had
detected
something
forced
something
not
quite
natural
about
her
She
s
trying
to
impress
us
I
thought
whatever
for
What
a
childish
trick
As
though
guessing
my
thoughts
she
suddenly
turned
a
rapid
searching
glance
upon
me
laughed
again
leaped
in
two
bounds
from
the
wall
and
going
up
to
the
old
woman
asked
her
for
a
glass
of
water
Do
you
think
I
am
thirsty
she
said
addressing
her
brother
no
there
are
some
flowers
on
the
walls
which
must
be
watered
Gagin
made
her
no
reply
and
with
the
glass
in
her
hand
she
began
scrambling
over
the
ruins
now
and
then
stopping
bending
down
and
with
comic
solemnity
pouring
a
few
drops
of
water
which
sparkled
brightly
in
the
sun
Her
movements
were
very
charming
but
I
felt
as
before
angry
with
her
even
while
I
could
not
help
admiring
her
lightness
and
agility
At
one
dangerous
place
she
purposely
screamed
and
then
laughed
I
felt
still
more
annoyed
with
her
Why
she
climbs
like
a
goat
the
old
woman
mumbled
turning
for
an
instant
from
her
stocking
At
last
Acia
had
emptied
the
glass
and
with
a
saucy
swing
she
walked
back
to
us
A
queer
smile
was
faintly
twitching
at
her
eyebrows
nostrils
and
lips
her
dark
eyes
were
screwed
up
with
a
half
insolent
half
merry
look
You
consider
my
behaviour
improper
her
face
seemed
to
say
all
the
same
I
know
you
re
admiring
me
Well
done
Acia
well
done
Gagin
said
in
a
low
voice
She
seemed
all
at
once
overcome
with
shame
she
dropped
her
long
eyelashes
and
sat
down
beside
us
with
a
guilty
air
At
that
moment
I
got
for
the
first
time
a
good
look
at
her
face
the
most
changeable
face
I
had
ever
seen
A
few
instants
later
it
had
turned
quite
pale
and
wore
an
intense
almost
mournful
expression
its
very
features
seemed
larger
sterner
simpler
She
completely
subsided
We
walked
round
the
ruins
Acia
followed
us
and
admired
the
views
Meanwhile
it
was
getting
near
dinner-time
As
he
paid
the
old
woman
Gagin
asked
for
another
mug
of
beer
and
turning
to
me
cried
with
a
sly
face
To
the
health
of
the
lady
of
your
heart
Why
has
he
have
you
such
a
lady
Acia
asked
suddenly
Why
who
hasn
t
retorted
Gagin
Acia
seemed
pensive
for
an
instant
then
her
face
changed
the
challenging
almost
insolent
smile
came
back
once
more
On
the
way
home
she
kept
laughing
and
was
more
mischievous
again
She
broke
off
a
long
branch
put
it
on
her
shoulder
like
a
gun
and
tied
her
scarf
round
her
head
I
remember
we
met
a
numerous
family
of
light-haired
affected
English
people
they
all
as
though
at
a
word
of
command
looked
Acia
up
and
down
with
their
glassy
eyes
in
chilly
amazement
while
she
started
singing
aloud
as
though
in
defiance
of
them
When
she
reached
home
she
went
straight
to
her
own
room
and
only
appeared
when
dinner
was
on
the
table
She
was
dressed
in
her
best
clothes
had
carefully
arranged
her
hair
laced
herself
in
at
the
waist
and
put
on
gloves
At
dinner
she
behaved
very
decorously
almost
affectedly
hardly
tasting
anything
and
drinking
water
out
of
a
wine-glass
She
obviously
wanted
to
show
herself
in
a
new
character
before
me
the
character
of
a
well-bred
refined
young
lady
Gagin
did
not
check
her
one
could
see
that
it
was
his
habit
to
humour
her
in
everything
He
merely
glanced
at
me
good-humouredly
now
and
then
and
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
he
would
say
She
s
a
baby
don
t
be
hard
on
her
Directly
dinner
was
over
Acia
got
up
made
us
a
curtsey
and
putting
on
her
hat
asked
Gagin
if
she
might
go
to
see
Frau
Luise
Since
when
do
you
ask
leave
he
answered
with
his
invariable
smile
a
rather
embarrassed
smile
this
time
are
you
bored
with
us
No
but
I
promised
Frau
Luise
yesterday
to
go
and
see
her
besides
I
thought
you
would
like
better
being
alone
Mr
N
she
indicated
me
will
tell
you
something
more
about
himself
She
went
out
Frau
Luise
Gagin
began
trying
to
avoid
meeting
my
eyes
is
the
widow
of
a
former
burgomaster
here
a
good-natured
but
silly
old
woman
She
has
taken
a
great
fancy
to
Acia
Acia
has
a
passion
for
making
friends
with
people
of
a
lower
class
I
ve
noticed
it
s
always
pride
that
s
at
the
root
of
that
She
s
pretty
well
spoilt
with
me
as
you
see
he
went
on
after
a
brief
pause
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
I
can
t
be
exacting
with
any
one
and
with
her
less
than
any
one
else
I
am
bound
not
to
be
hard
on
her
I
was
silent
Gagin
changed
the
conversation
The
more
I
saw
of
him
the
more
strongly
was
I
attracted
by
him
I
soon
understood
him
His
was
a
typically
Russian
nature
truthful
honest
simple
but
unhappily
without
energy
lacking
tenacity
and
inward
fire
Youth
was
not
boiling
over
within
him
but
shone
with
a
subdued
light
He
was
very
sweet
and
clever
but
I
could
not
picture
to
myself
what
he
would
become
in
ripe
manhood
An
artist
without
intense
incessant
toil
there
is
no
being
an
artist
and
as
for
toil
I
mused
watching
his
soft
features
listening
to
his
slow
deliberate
talk
no
you
ll
never
toil
you
don
t
know
how
to
put
pressure
on
yourself
But
not
to
love
him
was
an
impossibility
one
s
heart
was
simply
drawn
to
him
We
spent
four
hours
together
sometimes
sitting
on
the
sofa
sometimes
walking
slowly
up
and
down
before
the
house
and
in
those
four
hours
we
became
intimate
friends
The
sun
was
setting
and
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
home
Acia
had
not
yet
come
back
What
a
reckless
thing
she
is
said
Gagin
Shall
I
come
along
with
you
We
ll
turn
in
at
Frau
Luise
s
on
the
way
I
ll
ask
whether
she
s
there
It
s
not
far
out
of
the
way
We
went
down
into
the
town
and
turning
off
into
a
narrow
crooked
little
by-street
stopped
before
a
house
four
storeys
high
and
with
two
windows
abreast
in
each
storey
The
second
storey
projected
beyond
the
first
the
third
and
fourth
stood
out
still
further
than
the
second
the
whole
house
with
its
crumbling
carving
its
two
stout
columns
below
its
pointed
brick
roof
and
the
projecting
piece
on
the
attic
poking
out
like
a
beak
looked
like
a
huge
crouching
bird
Acia
shouted
Gagin
are
you
here
A
window
with
a
light
in
it
in
the
third
storey
rattled
and
opened
and
we
saw
Acia
s
dark
head
Behind
her
peered
out
the
toothless
and
dim-sighted
face
of
an
old
German
woman
I
m
here
said
Acia
leaning
roguishly
out
with
her
elbows
on
the
window-sill
I
m
quite
contented
here
Hullo
there
catch
she
added
flinging
Gagin
a
twig
of
geranium
imagine
I
m
the
lady
of
your
heart
Frau
Luise
laughed
N
is
going
said
Gagin
he
wants
to
say
good-bye
to
you
Really
said
Acia
in
that
case
give
him
my
geranium
and
I
ll
come
back
directly
She
slammed-to
the
window
and
seemed
to
be
kissing
Frau
Luise
Gagin
offered
me
the
twig
without
a
word
I
put
it
in
my
pocket
in
silence
went
on
to
the
ferry
and
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
I
remember
I
went
home
thinking
of
nothing
in
particular
but
with
a
strange
load
at
my
heart
when
I
was
suddenly
struck
by
a
strong
familiar
scent
rare
in
Germany
I
stood
still
and
saw
near
the
road
a
small
bed
of
hemp
Its
fragrance
of
the
steppes
instantaneously
brought
my
own
country
to
my
mind
and
stirred
a
passionate
longing
for
it
in
my
heart
I
longed
to
breathe
Russian
air
to
tread
on
Russian
soil
What
am
I
doing
here
why
am
I
trailing
about
in
foreign
countries
among
strangers
I
cried
and
the
dead
weight
I
had
felt
at
my
heart
suddenly
passed
into
a
bitter
stinging
emotion
I
reached
home
in
quite
a
different
frame
of
mind
from
the
evening
before
I
felt
almost
enraged
and
it
was
a
long
while
before
I
could
recover
my
equanimity
I
was
beset
by
a
feeling
of
anger
I
could
not
explain
At
last
I
sat
down
and
bethinking
myself
of
my
faithless
widow
I
wound
up
every
day
regularly
by
dreaming
as
in
duty
bound
of
this
lady
I
pulled
out
one
of
her
letters
But
I
did
not
even
open
it
my
thoughts
promptly
took
another
turn
I
began
dreaming
dreaming
of
Acia
I
recollected
that
Gagin
had
in
the
course
of
conversation
hinted
at
certain
difficulties
obstacles
in
the
way
of
his
returning
to
Russia
Come
is
she
his
sister
I
said
aloud
I
undressed
got
into
bed
and
tried
to
get
to
sleep
but
an
hour
later
I
was
sitting
up
again
in
bed
propped
up
with
my
elbow
on
the
pillow
and
was
once
more
thinking
about
this
whimsical
chit
of
a
girl
with
the
affected
laugh
She
s
the
figure
of
the
little
Galatea
of
Raphael
in
the
Farnesino
I
murmured
yes
and
she
s
not
his
sister
The
widow
s
letter
lay
tranquil
and
undisturbed
on
the
floor
a
white
patch
in
the
moonlight
Next
morning
I
went
again
to
L
I
persuaded
myself
I
wanted
to
see
Gagin
but
secretly
I
was
tempted
to
go
and
see
what
Acia
would
do
whether
she
would
be
as
whimsical
as
on
the
previous
day
I
found
them
both
in
their
sitting-room
and
strange
to
say
possibly
because
I
had
been
thinking
so
much
that
night
and
morning
of
Russia
Acia
struck
me
as
a
typically
Russian
girl
and
a
girl
of
the
humbler
class
almost
like
a
Russian
servant-girl
She
wore
an
old
gown
she
had
combed
her
hair
back
behind
her
ears
and
was
sitting
still
as
a
mouse
at
the
window
working
at
some
embroidery
in
a
frame
quietly
demurely
as
though
she
had
never
done
anything
else
all
her
life
She
said
scarcely
anything
looked
quietly
at
her
work
and
her
features
wore
such
an
ordinary
commonplace
expression
that
I
could
not
help
thinking
of
our
Katias
and
Mashas
at
home
in
Russia
To
complete
the
resemblance
she
started
singing
in
a
low
voice
Little
mother
little
dove
I
looked
at
her
little
face
which
was
rather
yellow
and
listless
I
thought
of
my
dreams
of
the
previous
night
and
I
felt
a
pang
of
regret
for
something
It
was
exquisite
weather
Gagin
announced
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
sketch
to-day
from
nature
I
asked
him
if
he
would
let
me
go
with
him
whether
I
shouldn
t
be
in
his
way
On
the
contrary
he
assured
me
you
may
give
me
some
good
advice
He
put
on
a
hat
la
Vandyck
and
a
blouse
took
a
canvas
under
his
arm
and
set
out
I
sauntered
after
him
Acia
stayed
at
home
Gagin
as
he
went
out
asked
her
to
see
that
the
soup
wasn
t
too
thin
Acia
promised
to
look
into
the
kitchen
Gagin
went
as
far
as
the
valley
I
knew
already
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
began
to
sketch
a
hollow
oak
with
spreading
branches
I
lay
on
the
grass
and
took
out
a
book
but
I
didn
t
read
two
pages
and
he
simply
spoiled
a
sheet
of
paper
we
did
little
else
but
talk
and
as
far
as
I
am
competent
to
judge
we
talked
rather
cleverly
and
subtly
of
the
right
method
of
working
of
what
we
must
avoid
and
what
one
must
cling
to
and
wherein
lay
the
significance
of
the
artist
in
our
age
Gagin
at
last
decided
that
he
was
not
in
the
mood
to-day
and
lay
down
beside
me
on
the
grass
And
then
our
youthful
eloquence
flowed
freely
fervent
pensive
enthusiastic
by
turns
but
consisting
almost
always
of
those
vague
generalities
into
which
a
Russian
is
so
ready
to
expand
When
we
had
talked
to
our
hearts
content
and
were
full
of
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
as
though
we
had
got
something
done
achieved
some
sort
of
success
we
returned
home
I
found
Acia
just
as
I
had
left
her
however
assiduously
I
watched
her
I
could
not
detect
a
shade
of
coquetry
nor
a
sign
of
an
intentionally
assumed
r
le
in
her
this
time
it
was
impossible
to
reproach
her
for
artificiality
Aha
said
Gagin
she
has
imposed
fasting
and
penance
on
herself
Towards
evening
she
yawned
several
times
with
obvious
genuineness
and
went
early
to
her
room
I
myself
soon
said
good-bye
to
Gagin
and
as
I
went
home
I
had
no
dreams
of
any
kind
that
day
was
spent
in
sober
sensations
I
remember
however
as
I
lay
down
to
sleep
I
involuntarily
exclaimed
aloud
What
a
chameleon
the
girl
is
and
after
a
moment
s
thought
I
added
anyway
she
s
not
his
sister
A
whole
fortnight
passed
by
I
visited
the
Gagins
every
day
Acia
seemed
to
avoid
me
but
she
did
not
permit
herself
one
of
the
mischievous
tricks
which
had
so
surprised
me
the
first
two
days
of
our
acquaintance
She
seemed
secretly
wounded
or
embarrassed
she
even
laughed
less
than
at
first
I
watched
her
with
curiosity
She
spoke
French
and
German
fairly
well
but
one
could
easily
see
in
everything
she
did
that
she
had
not
from
childhood
been
brought
up
under
a
woman
s
care
and
that
she
had
had
a
curious
irregular
education
that
had
nothing
in
common
with
Gagin
s
bringing
up
He
was
in
spite
of
the
Vandyck
hat
and
the
blouse
so
thoroughly
every
inch
of
him
the
soft
half-effeminate
Great
Russian
nobleman
while
she
was
not
like
the
young
girl
of
the
same
class
In
all
her
movements
there
was
a
certain
restlessness
The
wild
stock
had
not
long
been
grafted
the
new
wine
was
still
fermenting
By
nature
modest
and
timid
she
was
exasperated
by
her
own
shyness
and
in
her
exasperation
tried
to
force
herself
to
be
bold
and
free
and
easy
in
which
she
was
not
always
successful
I
sometimes
began
to
talk
to
her
about
her
life
in
Russia
about
her
past
she
answered
my
questions
reluctantly
I
found
out
however
that
before
going
abroad
she
had
lived
a
long
while
in
the
country
I
came
upon
her
once
intent
on
a
book
alone
With
her
head
on
her
hands
and
her
fingers
thrust
into
her
hair
she
was
eagerly
devouring
the
lines
Bravo
I
said
going
up
to
her
how
studious
you
are
She
raised
her
head
and
looked
gravely
and
severely
at
me
You
think
I
can
do
nothing
but
laugh
she
said
and
was
about
to
go
away
I
glanced
at
the
title
of
the
book
it
was
some
French
novel
I
can
t
commend
your
choice
though
I
observed
What
am
I
to
read
then
she
cried
and
flinging
the
book
on
the
table
she
added
so
I
d
better
go
and
play
the
fool
and
ran
out
into
the
garden
That
same
day
in
the
evening
I
was
reading
Gagin
Hermann
und
Dorothea
Acia
at
first
kept
fidgeting
about
us
then
all
at
once
she
stopped
listened
softly
sat
down
by
me
and
heard
the
reading
through
to
the
end
The
next
day
I
hardly
knew
her
again
till
I
guessed
it
had
suddenly
occurred
to
her
to
be
as
domestic
and
discreet
as
Dorothea
In
fact
I
saw
her
as
a
half-enigmatic
creature
Vain
self-conscious
to
the
last
degree
she
attracted
me
even
when
I
was
irritated
by
her
Of
one
thing
only
I
felt
more
and
more
convinced
and
that
was
that
she
was
not
Gagin
s
sister
His
manner
with
her
was
not
like
a
brother
s
it
was
too
affectionate
too
considerate
and
at
the
same
time
a
little
constrained
A
curious
incident
apparently
confirmed
my
suspicions
One
evening
when
I
reached
the
vineyard
where
the
Gagins
lived
I
found
the
gate
fastened
Without
losing
much
time
in
deliberation
I
made
my
way
to
a
broken-down
place
I
had
noticed
before
in
the
hedge
and
jumped
over
it
Not
far
from
this
spot
there
was
a
little
arbour
of
acacias
on
one
side
of
the
path
I
got
up
to
it
and
was
just
about
to
pass
it
Suddenly
I
was
struck
by
Acia
s
voice
passionately
and
tearfully
uttering
the
following
words
No
I
ll
love
no
one
but
you
no
no
I
will
love
you
only
for
ever
Come
Acia
calm
yourself
said
Gagin
you
know
I
believe
you
Their
voices
came
from
the
arbour
I
could
see
them
both
through
the
thin
net-work
of
leaves
They
did
not
notice
me
You
you
only
she
repeated
and
she
flung
herself
on
his
neck
and
with
broken
sobs
began
kissing
him
and
clinging
to
his
breast
Come
come
he
repeated
lightly
passing
his
hand
over
her
hair
For
a
few
instants
I
stood
motionless
Suddenly
I
started
should
I
go
up
to
them
On
no
consideration
flashed
through
my
head
With
rapid
footsteps
I
turned
back
to
the
hedge
leaped
over
it
into
the
road
and
almost
running
went
home
I
smiled
rubbed
my
hands
wondered
at
the
chance
which
had
so
suddenly
confirmed
my
surmises
I
did
not
for
one
instant
doubt
their
accuracy
and
yet
there
was
a
great
bitterness
in
my
heart
What
accomplished
hypocrites
they
are
though
I
thought
And
what
for
Why
should
he
try
to
take
me
in
I
shouldn
t
have
expected
it
of
him
And
what
a
touching
scene
of
reconciliation
I
slept
badly
and
next
morning
got
up
early
fastened
a
knapsack
on
my
back
and
telling
my
landlady
not
to
expect
me
back
for
the
night
set
off
walking
to
the
mountains
along
the
upper
part
of
the
stream
on
which
Z
is
situated
These
mountains
offsets
of
the
ridge
known
as
the
Hundsr
ck
are
very
interesting
from
a
geological
point
of
view
They
are
especially
remarkable
for
the
purity
and
regularity
of
the
strata
of
basalt
but
I
was
in
no
mood
for
geological
observations
I
did
not
take
stock
of
what
was
passing
within
me
One
feeling
was
clear
to
me
a
disinclination
to
see
the
Gagins
I
assured
myself
that
the
sole
reason
of
my
sudden
distaste
for
their
society
was
anger
at
their
duplicity
Who
forced
them
to
pass
themselves
off
as
brother
and
sister
However
I
tried
not
to
think
about
them
I
sauntered
in
leisurely
fashion
about
the
mountains
and
valleys
sat
in
the
village
inns
talking
peacefully
to
the
innkeepers
and
people
drinking
in
them
or
lay
on
a
flat
stone
warmed
by
the
sun
and
watched
the
clouds
floating
by
Luckily
it
was
exquisite
weather
In
such
pursuits
I
passed
three
days
and
not
without
pleasure
though
my
heart
did
ache
at
times
My
own
mood
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
peaceful
nature
of
that
quiet
countryside
I
gave
myself
up
entirely
to
the
play
of
circumstances
of
fleeting
impressions
in
slow
succession
they
flowed
through
my
soul
and
left
on
it
at
last
one
general
sensation
in
which
all
I
had
seen
felt
and
heard
in
those
three
days
was
mingled
all
the
delicate
fragrance
of
resin
in
the
forest
the
call
and
tap
of
the
woodpeckers
the
never-ceasing
chatter
of
the
clear
brooks
with
spotted
trout
lying
in
the
sand
at
the
bottom
the
somewhat
softened
outlines
of
the
mountains
the
surly
rocks
the
little
clean
villages
with
respectable
old
churches
and
trees
the
storks
in
the
meadows
the
neat
mills
with
swiftly
turning
wheels
the
beaming
faces
of
the
villagers
their
blue
smocks
and
grey
stockings
the
creaking
deliberately-moving
wagons
drawn
by
sleek
horses
and
sometimes
cows
the
long-haired
young
men
wandering
on
the
clean
roads
planted
with
apple
and
pear
trees
Even
now
I
like
to
recall
my
impressions
of
those
days
Good
luck
go
with
thee
modest
nook
of
Germany
with
thy
simple
plenty
with
traces
everywhere
of
busy
hands
of
patient
though
leisurely
toil
Good
luck
and
peace
to
thee
I
came
home
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
I
forgot
to
say
that
in
my
anger
with
the
Gagins
I
tried
to
revive
the
image
of
my
cruel-hearted
widow
but
my
efforts
were
fruitless
I
remember
when
I
applied
myself
to
musing
upon
her
I
saw
a
little
peasant
girl
of
five
years
old
with
a
round
little
face
and
innocently
staring
eyes
She
gazed
with
such
childish
directness
at
me
I
felt
ashamed
before
her
innocent
stare
I
could
not
lie
in
her
presence
and
at
once
and
once
for
all
said
a
last
good-bye
to
my
former
flame
At
home
I
found
a
note
from
Gagin
He
wondered
at
the
suddenness
of
my
plan
reproached
me
asked
why
I
had
not
taken
