Kirillovna
who
announced
respectfully
that
a
merchant
desired
to
speak
to
her
on
important
business
Kirillovna
was
still
high
in
her
mistress
's
favour
in
reality
it
was
she
who
managed
Madame
Kuntse
's
estate
and
she
had
some
time
before
obtained
permission
to
wear
a
white
cap
which
gave
still
more
acerbity
to
the
sharp
features
of
her
swarthy
face
A
merchant
said
her
mistress
what
does
he
want
I
do
n't
know
what
he
wants
answered
Kirillovna
in
an
insinuating
voice
only
I
think
he
wants
to
buy
something
from
you
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
went
back
into
the
drawing-room
sat
down
in
her
usual
seat
an
armchair
with
a
canopy
over
it
upon
which
a
climbing
plant
twined
gracefully
and
gave
orders
that
the
merchant
should
be
summoned
Naum
appeared
bowed
and
stood
still
by
the
door
I
hear
that
you
want
to
buy
something
of
me
said
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
and
thought
to
herself
What
a
handsome
man
this
merchant
is
Just
so
madam
What
is
it
Would
you
be
willing
to
sell
your
inn
What
inn
Why
the
one
on
the
high
road
not
far
from
here
But
that
inn
is
not
mine
it
is
Akim
's
Not
yours
Why
it
stands
on
your
land
Yes
the
land
is
mine
bought
in
my
name
but
the
inn
is
his
To
be
sure
But
would
n't
you
be
willing
to
sell
it
to
me
How
could
I
sell
it
to
you
Well
I
would
give
you
a
good
price
for
it
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
was
silent
for
a
space
It
is
really
very
queer
what
you
are
saying
she
said
And
what
would
you
give
she
added
I
do
n't
ask
that
for
myself
but
for
Akim
For
all
the
buildings
and
the
appurtenances
together
with
the
land
that
goes
with
it
of
course
I
would
give
two
thousand
roubles
Two
thousand
roubles
That
is
not
enough
replied
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
It
's
a
good
price
But
have
you
spoken
to
Akim
What
should
I
speak
to
him
for
The
inn
is
yours
so
here
I
am
talking
to
you
about
it
But
I
have
told
you
It
really
is
astonishing
that
you
don't
understand
me
Not
understand
madam
But
I
do
understand
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
looked
at
Naum
and
Naum
looked
at
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
Well
then
he
began
what
do
you
propose
I
propose
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
moved
in
her
chair
In
the
first
place
I
tell
you
that
two
thousand
is
too
little
and
in
the
second
I
'll
add
another
hundred
then
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
got
up
I
see
that
you
are
talking
quite
off
the
point
I
have
told
you
already
that
I
can
not
sell
that
inn
am
not
going
to
sell
it
I
can
not
that
is
I
will
not
Naum
smiled
and
said
nothing
for
a
space
Well
as
you
please
madam
he
said
shrugging
his
shoulders
I
beg
to
take
leave
He
bowed
and
took
hold
of
the
door
handle
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
turned
round
to
him
You
need
not
go
away
yet
however
she
said
with
hardly
perceptible
agitation
She
rang
the
bell
and
Kirillovna
came
in
from
the
study
Kirillovna
tell
them
to
give
this
gentleman
some
tea
I
will
see
you
again
she
added
with
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
Naum
bowed
again
and
went
out
with
Kirillovna
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
walked
up
and
down
the
room
once
or
twice
and
rang
the
bell
again
This
time
a
page
appeared
She
told
him
to
fetch
Kirillovna
A
few
moments
later
Kirillovna
came
in
with
a
faint
creak
of
her
new
goatskin
shoes
Have
you
heard
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
began
with
a
forced
laugh
what
this
merchant
has
been
proposing
to
me
He
is
a
queer
fellow
really
No
I
have
n't
heard
What
is
it
madam
and
Kirillovna
faintly
screwed
up
her
black
Kalmuck
eyes
He
wants
to
buy
Akim
's
inn
Well
why
not
But
how
could
he
What
about
Akim
I
gave
it
to
Akim
Upon
my
word
madam
what
are
you
saying
Is
n't
the
inn
yours
Don't
we
all
belong
to
you
And
is
n't
all
our
property
yours
our
mistress
's
Good
gracious
Kirillovna
what
are
you
saying
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
pulled
out
a
batiste
handkerchief
and
nervously
blew
her
nose
Akim
bought
the
inn
with
his
own
money
His
own
money
But
where
did
he
get
the
money
Was
n't
it
through
your
kindness
He
has
had
the
use
of
the
land
all
this
time
as
it
is
It
was
all
through
your
gracious
permission
And
do
you
suppose
madam
that
he
would
have
no
money
left
Why
he
is
richer
than
you
are
upon
my
word
he
is
That
's
all
true
of
course
but
still
I
ca
n't
do
it
How
could
I
sell
the
inn
And
why
not
sell
it
Kirillovna
went
on
since
a
purchaser
has
luckily
turned
up
May
I
ask
madam
how
much
he
offers
you
More
than
two
thousand
roubles
said
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
softly
He
will
give
more
madam
if
he
offers
two
thousand
straight
off
And
you
will
arrange
things
with
Akim
afterwards
take
a
little
off
his
yearly
duty
or
something
He
will
be
thankful
too
Of
course
I
must
remit
part
of
his
duty
But
no
Kirillovna
how
can
I
sell
it
and
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
walked
up
and
down
the
room
No
that
's
out
of
the
question
that
wo
n't
do
no
please
do
n't
speak
of
it
again
or
I
shall
be
angry
But
in
spite
of
her
agitated
mistress
's
warning
Kirillovna
did
continue
speaking
of
it
and
half
an
hour
later
she
went
back
to
Naum
whom
she
had
left
in
the
butler
's
pantry
at
the
samovar
What
have
you
to
tell
me
good
madam
said
Naum
jauntily
turning
his
tea-cup
wrong
side
upwards
in
the
saucer
What
I
have
to
tell
you
is
that
you
are
to
go
in
to
the
mistress
she
wants
you
Certainly
said
Naum
and
he
got
up
and
followed
Kirillovna
into
the
drawing-room
The
door
closed
behind
them
When
the
door
opened
again
and
Naum
walked
out
backwards
bowing
the
matter
was
settled
Akim
's
inn
belonged
to
him
He
had
bought
it
for
2800
paper
roubles
It
was
arranged
that
the
legal
formalities
should
take
place
as
quickly
as
possible
and
that
till
then
the
matter
should
not
be
made
public
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
received
a
deposit
of
a
hundred
roubles
and
two
hundred
went
to
Kirillovna
for
her
assistance
It
has
not
cost
me
much
thought
Naum
as
he
got
into
his
coat
it
was
a
lucky
chance
While
the
transaction
we
have
described
was
going
forward
in
the
mistress
's
house
Akim
was
sitting
at
home
alone
on
the
bench
by
the
window
stroking
his
beard
with
a
discontented
expression
We
have
said
already
that
he
did
not
suspect
his
wife
's
feeling
for
Naum
although
kind
friends
had
more
than
once
hinted
to
him
that
it
was
time
he
opened
his
eyes
it
is
true
that
he
had
noticed
himself
that
of
late
his
wife
had
become
rather
difficult
but
we
all
know
that
the
female
sex
is
capricious
and
changeable
Even
when
it
really
did
strike
him
that
things
were
not
going
well
in
his
house
he
merely
dismissed
the
thought
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
a
squabble
his
good
nature
had
not
lessened
with
years
and
indolence
was
asserting
itself
too
But
on
that
day
he
was
very
much
out
of
humour
the
day
before
he
had
overheard
quite
by
chance
in
the
street
a
conversation
between
their
servant
and
a
neighbouring
peasant
woman
The
peasant
woman
asked
the
servant
why
she
had
not
come
to
see
her
on
the
holiday
the
day
before
I
was
expecting
you
she
said
I
did
set
off
replied
the
servant
but
as
ill-luck
would
have
it
I
ran
into
the
mistress
botheration
take
her
Ran
into
her
repeated
the
peasant
woman
in
a
sing-song
voice
and
she
leaned
her
cheek
on
her
hand
And
where
did
you
run
into
her
my
good
girl
Beyond
the
priest
's
hemp-patch
She
must
have
gone
to
the
hemp-patch
to
meet
her
Naum
but
I
could
not
see
them
in
the
dusk
owing
to
the
moon
maybe
I
do
n't
know
I
simply
dashed
into
them
Dashed
into
them
the
other
woman
repeated
Well
and
was
she
standing
with
him
my
good
girl
Yes
she
was
He
was
standing
there
and
so
was
she
She
saw
me
and
said
'Where
are
you
running
to
Go
home
So
I
went
home
You
went
home
The
peasant
woman
was
silent
Well
good-bye
Fetinyushka
she
brought
out
at
last
and
trudged
off
This
conversation
had
an
unpleasant
effect
on
Akim
His
love
for
Avdotya
had
cooled
but
still
he
did
not
like
what
the
servant
had
said
And
she
had
told
the
truth
Avdotya
really
had
gone
out
that
evening
to
meet
Naum
who
had
been
waiting
for
her
in
the
patch
of
dense
shade
thrown
on
the
road
by
the
high
motionless
hemp
The
dew
bathed
every
stalk
of
it
from
top
to
bottom
the
strong
almost
overpowering
fragrance
hung
all
about
it
A
huge
crimson
moon
had
just
risen
in
the
dingy
blackish
mist
Naum
heard
the
hurried
footsteps
of
Avdotya
a
long
way
off
and
went
to
meet
her
She
came
up
to
him
pale
with
running
the
moon
lighted
up
her
face
Well
have
you
brought
it
he
asked
Brought
it
yes
I
have
she
answered
in
an
uncertain
voice
But
Naum
Ivanitch
Give
it
me
since
you
have
brought
it
he
interrupted
her
and
held
out
his
hand
She
took
a
parcel
from
under
her
shawl
Naum
took
it
at
once
and
thrust
it
in
his
bosom
Naum
Ivanitch
Avdotya
said
slowly
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
oh
Naum
Ivanitch
you
will
bring
my
soul
to
ruin
It
was
at
that
instant
that
the
servant
came
up
to
them
And
so
Akim
was
sitting
on
the
bench
discontentedly
stroking
his
beard
Avdotya
kept
coming
into
the
room
and
going
out
again
He
simply
followed
her
with
his
eyes
At
last
she
came
into
the
room
and
after
taking
a
jerkin
from
the
lobby
was
just
crossing
the
threshold
when
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
said
as
though
speaking
to
himself
I
wonder
he
began
why
it
is
women
are
always
in
a
fuss
It
's
no
good
expecting
them
to
sit
still
That
's
not
in
their
line
But
running
out
morning
or
evening
that
's
what
they
like
Yes
Avdotya
listened
to
her
husband
's
words
without
changing
her
position
only
at
the
word
evening
she
moved
her
head
slightly
and
seemed
to
ponder
Once
you
begin
talking
Semyonitch
she
commented
at
last
with
vexation
there
is
no
stopping
you
And
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
she
went
away
and
slammed
the
door
Avdotya
certainly
did
not
appreciate
Akim
's
eloquence
and
often
in
the
evenings
when
he
indulged
in
conversation
with
travellers
or
fell
to
telling
stories
she
stealthily
yawned
or
went
out
of
the
room
Akim
looked
at
the
closed
door
Once
you
begin
talking
he
repeated
in
an
undertone
The
fact
is
I
have
not
talked
enough
to
you
And
who
is
it
A
peasant
like
any
one
of
us
and
what
's
more
And
he
got
up
thought
a
little
and
tapped
the
back
of
his
head
with
his
fist
Several
days
passed
in
a
rather
strange
way
Akim
kept
looking
at
his
wife
as
though
he
were
preparing
to
say
something
to
her
and
she
for
her
part
looked
at
him
suspiciously
meanwhile
they
both
preserved
a
strained
silence
This
silence
however
was
broken
from
time
to
time
by
some
peevish
remark
from
Akim
in
regard
to
some
oversight
in
the
housekeeping
or
in
regard
to
women
in
general
For
the
most
part
Avdotya
did
not
answer
one
word
But
in
spite
of
Akim
's
good-natured
weakness
it
certainly
would
have
come
to
a
decisive
explanation
between
him
and
Avdotya
if
it
had
not
been
for
an
event
which
rendered
any
explanation
useless
One
morning
Akim
and
wife
were
just
beginning
lunch
owing
to
the
summer
work
in
the
fields
there
were
no
travellers
at
the
inn
when
suddenly
a
cart
rattled
briskly
along
the
road
and
pulled
up
sharply
at
the
front
door
Akim
peeped
out
of
window
frowned
and
looked
down
Naum
got
deliberately
out
of
the
cart
Avdotya
had
not
seen
him
but
when
she
heard
his
voice
in
the
entry
the
spoon
trembled
in
her
hand
He
told
the
labourers
to
put
up
the
horse
in
the
yard
At
last
the
door
opened
and
he
walked
into
the
room
Good-day
he
said
and
took
off
his
cap
Good-day
Akim
repeated
through
his
teeth
Where
has
God
brought
you
from
I
was
in
the
neighbourhood
replied
Naum
and
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
I
have
come
from
your
lady
From
the
lady
said
Akim
not
getting
up
from
his
seat
On
business
eh
Yes
on
business
My
respects
to
you
Avdotya
Arefyevona
Good
morning
Naum
Ivanitch
she
answered
All
were
silent
What
have
you
got
broth
is
it
began
Naum
Yes
broth
replied
Akim
and
all
at
once
he
turned
pale
but
not
for
you
Naum
glanced
at
Akim
with
surprise
Not
for
me
Not
for
you
and
that
's
all
about
it
Akim
's
eyes
glittered
and
he
brought
his
fist
on
the
table
There
is
nothing
in
my
house
for
you
do
you
hear
What
's
this
Semyonitch
what
is
the
matter
with
you
There
's
nothing
the
matter
with
me
but
I
am
sick
of
you
Naum
Ivanitch
that
's
what
it
is
The
old
man
got
up
trembling
all
over
You
poke
yourself
in
here
too
often
I
tell
you
Naum
too
got
up
You
've
gone
clean
off
your
head
old
man
he
said
with
a
jeer
Avdotya
Arefyevna
what
's
wrong
with
him
I
tell
you
shouted
Akim
in
a
cracked
voice
go
away
do
you
hear
You
have
nothing
to
do
with
Avdotya
Arefyevna
I
tell
you
do
you
hear
get
out
What
's
that
you
are
saying
to
me
Naum
asked
significantly
Go
out
of
the
house
that
's
what
I
am
telling
to
you
Here
's
God
and
here
's
the
door
do
you
understand
Or
there
will
be
trouble
Naum
took
a
step
forward
Good
gracious
do
n't
fight
my
dears
faltered
Avdotya
who
till
then
had
sat
motionless
at
the
table
Naum
glanced
at
her
Do
n't
be
uneasy
Avdotya
Arefyevna
why
should
we
fight
Fie
brother
what
a
hullabaloo
you
are
making
he
went
on
addressing
Akim
Yes
really
You
are
a
hasty
one
Has
anyone
ever
heard
of
turning
anyone
out
of
his
house
especially
the
owner
of
it
Naum
added
with
slow
deliberateness
Out
of
his
house
muttered
Akim
What
owner
Me
if
you
like
And
Naum
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
showed
his
white
teeth
in
a
grin
You
Why
it
's
my
house
is
n't
it
What
a
slow-witted
fellow
you
are
I
tell
you
it
's
mine
Akim
gazed
at
him
open-eyed
What
crazy
stuff
is
it
you
are
talking
One
would
think
you
had
gone
silly
he
said
at
last
How
the
devil
can
it
be
yours
What
's
the
good
of
talking
to
you
cried
Naum
impatiently
Do
you
see
this
bit
of
paper
he
went
on
pulling
out
of
his
pocket
a
sheet
of
stamped
paper
folded
in
four
do
you
see
This
is
the
deed
of
sale
do
you
understand
the
deed
of
sale
of
your
land
and
your
house
I
have
bought
them
from
the
lady
from
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
the
deed
was
drawn
up
at
the
town
yesterday
so
I
am
master
here
not
you
Pack
your
belongings
today
he
added
putting
the
document
back
in
his
pocket
and
do
n't
let
me
see
a
sign
of
you
here
to-morrow
do
you
hear
Akim
stood
as
though
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
Robber
he
moaned
at
last
robber
Heigh
Fedka
Mitka
wife
wife
seize
him
seize
him
hold
him
He
lost
his
head
completely
Mind
now
old
man
said
Naum
menacingly
mind
what
you
are
about
do
n't
play
the
fool
Beat
him
wife
beat
him
Akim
kept
repeating
in
a
tearful
voice
trying
helplessly
and
in
vain
to
get
up
Murderer
robber
She
is
not
enough
for
you
you
want
to
take
my
house
too
and
everything
But
no
stop
a
bit
that
ca
n't
be
I
'll
go
myself
I
'll
speak
myself
how
why
should
she
sell
it
Wait
a
bit
wait
a
bit
And
he
dashed
out
bareheaded
Where
are
you
off
to
Akim
Ivanitch
said
the
servant
Fetinya
running
into
him
in
the
doorway
To
our
mistress
Let
me
pass
To
our
mistress
wailed
Akim
and
seeing
Naum
's
cart
which
had
not
yet
been
taken
into
the
yard
he
jumped
into
it
snatched
the
reins
and
lashing
the
horse
with
all
his
might
set
off
at
full
speed
to
his
mistress
's
house
My
lady
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
all
the
way
how
have
I
lost
your
favour
I
should
have
thought
I
had
done
my
best
And
meantime
he
kept
lashing
and
lashing
the
horse
Those
who
met
him
moved
out
of
his
way
and
gazed
after
him
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Akim
had
reached
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
's
house
had
galloped
up
to
the
front
door
jumped
out
of
the
cart
and
dashed
straight
into
the
entry
What
do
you
want
muttered
the
frightened
footman
who
was
sleeping
sweetly
on
the
hall
bench
The
mistress
I
want
to
see
the
mistress
said
Akim
loudly
The
footman
was
amazed
Has
anything
happened
he
began
Nothing
has
happened
but
I
want
to
see
the
mistress
What
what
said
the
footman
more
and
more
astonished
and
he
slowly
drew
himself
up
Akim
pulled
himself
up
He
felt
as
though
cold
water
had
been
poured
on
him
Announce
to
the
mistress
please
Pyotr
Yevgrafitch
he
said
with
a
low
bow
that
Akim
asks
leave
to
see
her
Very
good
I
'll
go
I
'll
tell
her
but
you
must
be
drunk
wait
a
bit
grumbled
the
footman
and
he
went
off
Akim
looked
down
and
seemed
confused
His
determination
had
evaporated
as
soon
as
he
went
into
the
hall
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
was
confused
too
when
she
was
informed
that
Akim
had
come
She
immediately
summoned
Kirillovna
to
her
boudoir
I
ca
n't
see
him
she
began
hurriedly
as
soon
as
the
latter
appeared
I
absolutely
can
not
What
am
I
to
say
to
him
I
told
you
he
would
be
sure
to
come
and
complain
she
added
in
annoyance
and
agitation
I
told
you
But
why
should
you
see
him
Kirillovna
answered
calmly
there
is
no
need
to
Why
should
you
be
worried
No
indeed
What
is
to
be
done
then
If
you
will
permit
me
I
will
speak
to
him
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
raised
her
head
Please
do
Kirillovna
Talk
to
him
You
tell
him
that
I
found
it
necessary
but
that
I
will
compensate
him
say
what
you
think
best
Please
Kirillovna
Do
n't
you
worry
yourself
madam
answered
Kirillovna
and
she
went
out
her
shoes
creaking
A
quarter
of
an
hour
had
not
elapsed
when
their
creaking
was
heard
again
and
Kirillovna
walked
into
the
boudoir
with
the
same
unruffled
expression
on
her
face
and
the
same
sly
shrewdness
in
her
eyes
Well
asked
her
mistress
how
is
Akim
He
is
all
right
madam
He
says
that
it
must
all
be
as
you
graciously
please
that
if
only
you
have
good
health
and
prosperity
he
can
get
along
very
well
And
he
did
not
complain
No
madam
Why
should
he
complain
What
did
he
come
for
then
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
asked
in
some
surprise
He
came
to
ask
whether
you
would
excuse
his
yearly
payment
for
next
year
that
is
until
he
has
been
compensated
Of
course
of
course
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
caught
her
up
eagerly
Of
course
with
pleasure
And
tell
him
in
fact
that
I
will
make
it
up
to
him
Thank
you
Kirillovna
I
see
he
is
a
good-hearted
man
Stay
she
added
give
him
this
from
me
and
she
took
a
three-rouble
note
out
of
her
work-table
drawer
Here
take
this
give
it
to
him
Certainly
madam
answered
Kirillovna
and
going
calmly
back
to
her
room
she
locked
the
note
in
an
iron-cased
box
which
stood
at
the
head
of
her
bed
she
kept
in
it
all
her
spare
cash
and
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
it
Kirillovna
had
reassured
her
mistress
by
her
report
but
the
conversation
between
herself
and
Akim
had
not
been
quite
what
she
represented
She
had
sent
for
him
to
the
maid
's
room
At
first
he
had
not
come
declaring
that
he
did
not
want
to
see
Kirillovna
but
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
herself
he
had
however
at
last
obeyed
and
gone
by
the
back
door
to
see
Kirillovna
He
found
her
alone
He
stopped
at
once
on
getting
into
the
room
and
leaned
against
the
wall
by
the
door
he
would
have
spoken
but
he
could
not
Kirillovna
looked
at
him
intently
You
want
to
see
the
mistress
Akim
Semyonitch
she
began
He
simply
nodded
It
's
impossible
Akim
Semyonitch
And
what
's
the
use
What
's
done
ca
n't
be
undone
and
you
will
only
worry
the
mistress
She
ca
n't
see
you
now
Akim
Semyonitch
She
can
not
he
repeated
and
paused
Well
then
he
brought
out
at
last
so
then
my
house
is
lost
Listen
Akim
Semyonitch
I
know
you
have
always
been
a
sensible
man
Such
is
the
mistress
's
will
and
there
is
no
changing
it
You
can't
alter
that
Whatever
you
and
I
might
say
about
it
would
make
no
difference
would
it
Akim
put
his
arm
behind
his
back
You
'd
better
think
Kirillovna
went
on
should
n't
you
ask
the
mistress
to
let
you
off
your
yearly
payment
or
something
So
my
house
is
lost
repeated
Akim
in
the
same
voice
Akim
Semyonitch
I
tell
you
it
's
no
use
You
know
that
better
than
I
do
Yes
Anyway
you
might
tell
me
what
the
house
went
for
I
do
n't
know
Akim
Semyonitch
I
ca
n't
tell
you
But
why
are
you
standing
she
added
Sit
down
I
'd
rather
stand
I
am
a
peasant
I
thank
you
humbly
You
a
peasant
Akim
Semyonitch
You
are
as
good
as
a
merchant
let
alone
a
house-serf
What
do
you
mean
Do
n't
distress
yourself
for
nothing
Wo
n't
you
have
some
tea
No
thank
you
I
do
n't
want
it
So
you
have
got
hold
of
my
house
between
you
he
added
moving
away
from
the
wall
Thank
you
for
that
I
wish
you
good-bye
my
lady
And
he
turned
and
went
out
Kirillovna
straightened
her
apron
and
went
to
her
mistress
So
I
am
a
merchant
it
seems
Akim
said
to
himself
standing
before
the
gate
in
hesitation
A
nice
merchant
He
waved
his
hand
and
laughed
bitterly
Well
I
suppose
I
had
better
go
home
And
entirely
forgetting
Naum
's
horse
with
which
he
had
come
he
trudged
along
the
road
to
the
inn
Before
he
had
gone
the
first
mile
he
suddenly
heard
the
rattle
of
a
cart
beside
him
Akim
Akim
Semyonitch
someone
called
to
him
He
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
a
friend
of
his
the
parish
clerk
Yefrem
nicknamed
the
Mole
a
little
bent
man
with
a
sharp
nose
and
dim-sighted
eyes
He
was
sitting
on
a
bundle
of
straw
in
a
wretched
little
cart
and
leaning
forward
against
the
box
Are
you
going
home
he
asked
Akim
Akim
stopped
Yes
Shall
I
give
you
a
lift
Please
do
Yefrem
moved
to
one
side
and
Akim
climbed
into
the
cart
Yefrem
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat
exhilarated
began
lashing
at
his
wretched
little
horse
with
the
ends
of
his
cord
reins
it
set
off
at
a
weary
trot
continually
tossing
its
unbridled
head
They
drove
for
nearly
a
mile
without
saying
one
word
to
each
other
Akim
sat
with
his
head
bent
while
Yefrem
muttered
to
himself
alternately
urging
on
and
holding
back
his
horse
Where
have
you
been
without
your
cap
Semyonitch
he
asked
Akim
suddenly
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
went
on
You
've
left
it
at
some
tavern
that
's
what
you
've
done
You
are
a
drinking
man
I
know
you
and
I
like
you
for
it
that
you
are
a
drinker
you
are
not
a
murderer
not
a
rowdy
not
one
to
make
trouble
you
are
a
good
manager
but
you
are
a
drinker
and
such
a
drinker
you
ought
to
have
been
pulled
up
for
it
long
ago
yes
indeed
for
it
's
a
nasty
habit
Hurrah
he
shouted
suddenly
at
the
top
of
his
voice
Hurrah
Hurrah
Stop
Stop
a
woman
's
voice
sounded
close
by
Stop
Akim
looked
round
A
woman
so
pale
and
dishevelled
that
at
first
he
did
not
recognise
her
was
running
across
the
field
towards
the
cart
Stop
Stop
she
moaned
again
gasping
for
breath
and
waving
her
arms
Akim
started
it
was
his
wife
He
snatched
up
the
reins
What
's
the
good
of
stopping
muttered
Yefrem
Stopping
for
a
woman
Gee-up
But
Akim
pulled
the
horse
up
sharply
At
that
instant
Avdotya
ran
up
to
the
road
and
flung
herself
down
with
her
face
straight
in
the
dust
Akim
Semyonitch
she
wailed
he
has
turned
me
out
too
Akim
looked
at
her
and
did
not
stir
he
only
gripped
the
reins
tighter
Hurrah
Yefrem
shouted
again
So
he
has
turned
you
out
said
Akim
He
has
turned
me
out
Akim
Semyonitch
dear
Avdotya
answered
sobbing
He
has
turned
me
out
The
house
is
mine
he
said
so
you
can
go
Capital
That
's
a
fine
thing
capital
observed
Yefrem
So
I
suppose
you
thought
to
stay
on
Akim
brought
out
bitterly
still
sitting
in
the
cart
How
could
I
But
Akim
Semyonitch
went
on
Avdotya
who
had
raised
her
head
but
let
it
sink
to
the
earth
again
you
do
n't
know
I
kill
me
Akim
Semyonitch
kill
me
here
on
the
spot
Why
should
I
kill
you
Arefyevna
said
Akim
dejectedly
you
've
been
your
own
ruin
What
's
the
use
But
do
you
know
what
Akim
Semyonitch
the
money
your
money
your
money
's
gone
Wretched
sinner
as
I
am
I
took
it
from
under
the
floor
I
gave
it
all
to
him
to
that
villain
Naum
Why
did
you
tell
me
where
you
hid
your
money
wretched
sinner
as
I
am
It's
with
your
money
he
has
bought
the
house
the
villain
Sobs
choked
her
voice
Akim
clutched
his
head
with
both
hands
What
he
cried
at
last
all
the
money
too
the
money
and
the
house
and
you
did
it
Ah
You
took
it
from
under
the
floor
you
took
it
I
'll
kill
you
you
snake
in
the
grass
And
he
leapt
out
of
the
cart
Semyonitch
Semyonitch
do
n't
beat
her
do
n't
fight
faltered
Yefrem
on
whom
this
unexpected
adventure
began
to
have
a
sobering
effect
No
Akim
Semyonitch
kill
me
wretched
sinner
as
I
am
beat
me
don't
heed
him
cried
Avdotya
writhing
convulsively
at
Akim
's
feet
He
stood
a
moment
looked
at
her
moved
a
few
steps
away
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
beside
the
road
A
brief
silence
followed
Avdotya
turned
her
head
in
his
direction
Semyonitch
hey
Semyonitch
began
Yefrem
sitting
up
in
the
cart
give
over
you
know
you
wo
n't
make
things
any
better
Tfoo
what
a
business
he
went
on
as
though
to
himself
What
a
damnable
woman
Go
to
him
he
added
bending
down
over
the
side
of
the
cart
to
Avdotya
you
see
he
's
half
crazy
Avdotya
got
up
went
nearer
to
Akim
and
again
fell
at
his
feet
Akim
Semyonitch
she
began
in
a
faint
voice
Akim
got
up
and
went
back
to
the
cart
She
caught
at
the
skirt
of
his
coat
Get
away
he
shouted
savagely
and
pushed
her
off
Where
are
you
going
Yefrem
asked
seeing
that
he
was
getting
in
beside
him
again
You
were
going
to
take
me
to
my
home
said
Akim
but
take
me
to
yours
you
see
I
have
no
home
now
They
have
bought
mine
Very
well
come
to
me
And
what
about
her
Akim
made
no
answer
And
me
Me
Avdotya
repeated
with
tears
are
you
leaving
me
all
alone
Where
am
I
to
go
You
can
go
to
him
answered
Akim
without
turning
round
the
man
you
have
given
my
money
to
Drive
on
Yefrem
Yefrem
lashed
the
horse
the
cart
rolled
off
Avdotya
set
up
a
wail
Yefrem
lived
three-quarters
of
a
mile
from
Akim
's
inn
in
a
little
house
close
to
the
priest
's
near
the
solitary
church
with
five
cupolas
which
had
been
recently
built
by
the
heirs
of
a
rich
merchant
in
accordance
with
the
latter
's
will
Yefrem
said
nothing
to
Akim
all
the
way
he
merely
shook
his
head
from
time
to
time
and
uttered
such
ejaculations
as
Dear
dear
and
Upon
my
soul
Akim
sat
without
moving
turned
a
little
away
from
Yefrem
At
last
they
arrived
Yefrem
was
the
first
to
get
out
of
the
cart
A
little
girl
of
six
in
a
smock
tied
low
round
the
waist
ran
out
to
meet
him
and
shouted
Daddy
daddy
And
where
is
your
mother
asked
Yefrem
She
is
asleep
in
the
shed
Well
let
her
sleep
Akim
Semyonitch
wo
n't
you
get
out
sir
and
come
indoors
It
must
be
noted
that
Yefrem
addressed
him
familiarly
only
when
he
was
drunk
More
important
persons
than
Yefrem
spoke
to
Akim
with
formal
politeness
Akim
went
into
the
sacristan
's
hut
Here
sit
