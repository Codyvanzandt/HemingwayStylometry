pulling
the
roof
down
Exactly
so
He
is
walking
about
on
the
flooring
of
the
garret
in
the
roof
and
smashing
right
and
left
of
him
His
strength
you
are
aware
madam
is
superhuman
And
the
roof
too
one
must
say
is
a
poor
affair
half-inch
deal
battens
laid
wide
apart
one
inch
nails
My
mother
looked
at
me
as
though
wishing
to
make
sure
whether
she
had
heard
aright
Half-inches
wide
apart
she
repeated
obviously
not
understanding
the
meaning
of
one
word
Well
what
then
she
said
at
last
I
have
come
for
instructions
There
s
no
doing
anything
without
men
to
help
The
peasants
there
are
all
limp
with
fright
And
his
daughters
what
of
them
His
daughters
are
doing
nothing
They
re
running
to
and
fro
shouting
this
and
that
all
to
no
purpose
And
is
Sletkin
there
He
s
there
too
He
s
making
more
outcry
than
all
of
them
but
he
can
t
do
anything
And
Martin
Petrovitch
is
standing
on
the
roof
On
the
roof
that
is
in
the
garret
and
pulling
the
roof
to
pieces
Yes
yes
said
my
mother
half-inches
wide
apart
The
position
was
obviously
a
serious
one
What
steps
were
to
be
taken
Send
to
the
town
for
the
police
captain
Get
together
the
peasants
My
mother
was
quite
at
her
wits
end
Zhitkov
who
had
come
in
to
dinner
was
nonplussed
too
It
is
true
he
made
another
reference
to
a
battalion
of
military
he
offered
no
advice
however
but
confined
himself
to
looking
submissive
and
devoted
Kvitsinsky
seeing
he
would
not
get
at
any
instructions
suggested
to
my
mother
with
the
contemptuous
respectfulness
peculiar
to
him
that
if
she
would
authorise
him
to
take
a
few
of
the
stable-boys
gardeners
and
other
house-serfs
he
would
make
an
effort
Yes
yes
my
mother
cut
him
short
do
make
an
effort
dear
Vikenty
Osipitch
Only
make
haste
please
and
I
will
take
all
responsibility
on
myself
Kvitsinsky
smiled
coldly
One
thing
let
me
make
clear
madam
beforehand
it
s
impossible
to
reckon
on
any
result
seeing
that
Mr
Harlov
s
strength
is
so
great
and
he
is
so
desperate
too
he
feels
himself
to
have
been
very
cruelly
wronged
Yes
yes
my
mother
assented
and
it
s
all
that
vile
Souvenir
s
fault
Never
will
I
forgive
him
for
it
Go
and
take
the
servants
and
set
off
Vikenty
Osipitch
You
d
better
take
plenty
of
cord
Mr
Steward
and
some
fire-escape
tackle
Zhitkov
brought
out
in
his
bass
and
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
net
it
would
be
as
well
to
take
that
along
too
We
once
had
in
our
regiment
Kindly
refrain
from
instructing
me
sir
Kvitsinsky
cut
him
short
with
an
air
of
vexation
I
know
what
is
needed
without
your
aid
Zhitkov
was
offended
and
protested
that
as
he
imagined
he
too
was
called
upon
No
no
interposed
my
mother
you
d
better
stop
where
you
are
Let
Vikenty
Osipitch
act
alone
Make
haste
Vikenty
Osipitch
Zhitkov
was
still
more
offended
while
Kvitsinsky
bowed
and
went
out
I
rushed
off
to
the
stable
hurriedly
saddled
my
horse
myself
and
set
off
at
a
gallop
along
the
road
to
Eskovo
The
rain
had
ceased
but
the
wind
was
blowing
with
redoubled
force
straight
into
my
face
Half-way
there
the
saddle
almost
slipped
round
under
me
the
girth
had
got
loose
I
got
off
and
tried
to
tighten
the
straps
with
my
teeth
All
at
once
I
heard
someone
calling
me
by
my
name
Souvenir
was
running
towards
me
across
the
green
fields
What
he
shouted
to
me
from
some
way
off
was
your
curiosity
too
much
for
you
But
it
s
no
use
I
went
over
there
straight
at
Harlov
s
heels
Such
a
state
of
things
you
never
saw
in
your
life
You
want
to
enjoy
what
you
have
done
I
said
indignantly
and
jumping
on
my
horse
I
set
off
again
at
a
gallop
But
the
indefatigable
Souvenir
did
not
give
me
up
and
chuckled
and
grinned
even
as
he
ran
At
last
Eskovo
was
reached
there
was
the
dam
and
there
the
long
hedge
and
willow-tree
of
the
homestead
I
rode
up
to
the
gate
dismounted
tied
up
my
horse
and
stood
still
in
amazement
Of
one
third
of
the
roof
of
the
newer
house
of
the
front
part
nothing
was
left
but
the
skeleton
boards
and
litter
lay
in
disorderly
heaps
on
the
ground
on
both
sides
of
the
building
Even
supposing
the
roof
to
be
as
Kvitsinsky
had
said
a
poor
affair
even
so
it
was
something
incredible
On
the
floor
of
the
garret
in
a
whirl
of
dust
and
rubbish
a
blackish
grey
mass
was
moving
to
and
fro
with
rapid
ungainly
action
at
one
moment
shaking
the
remaining
chimney
built
of
brick
the
other
had
fallen
already
then
tearing
up
the
boarding
and
flinging
it
down
below
then
clutching
at
the
very
rafters
It
was
Harlov
He
struck
me
as
being
exactly
like
a
bear
at
this
moment
too
the
head
and
back
and
shoulders
were
a
bear
s
and
he
put
his
feet
down
wide
apart
without
bending
the
insteps
also
like
a
bear
The
bitter
wind
was
blowing
upon
him
from
every
side
lifting
his
matted
locks
It
was
horrible
to
see
here
and
there
red
patches
of
bare
flesh
through
the
rents
in
his
tattered
clothes
it
was
horrible
to
hear
his
wild
husky
muttering
There
were
a
lot
of
people
in
the
yard
peasant-women
boys
and
servant-girls
stood
close
along
the
hedge
A
few
peasants
huddled
together
in
a
separate
group
a
little
way
off
The
old
village
priest
whom
I
knew
was
standing
bareheaded
on
the
steps
of
the
other
house
and
holding
a
brazen
cross
in
both
hands
from
time
to
time
silently
and
hopelessly
raised
it
and
as
it
were
showed
it
to
Harlov
Beside
the
priest
stood
Evlampia
with
her
back
against
the
wall
gazing
fixedly
at
her
father
Anna
at
one
moment
pushed
her
head
out
of
the
little
window
then
vanished
then
hurried
into
the
yard
then
went
back
into
the
house
Sletkin
pale
all
over
livid
in
an
old
dressing-gown
and
smoking-cap
with
a
single-barrelled
rifle
in
his
hands
kept
running
to
and
fro
with
little
steps
He
had
completely
gone
Jewish
as
it
is
called
He
was
gasping
threatening
shaking
pointing
the
gun
at
Harlov
then
letting
it
drop
back
on
his
shoulder
pointing
it
again
shrieking
weeping
On
seeing
Souvenir
and
me
he
simply
flew
to
us
Look
look
what
is
going
on
here
he
wailed
look
He
s
gone
out
of
his
mind
he
s
raving
mad
and
see
what
he
s
doing
I
ve
sent
for
the
police
already
but
no
one
comes
No
one
comes
If
I
do
fire
at
him
the
law
couldn
t
touch
me
for
every
man
has
a
right
to
defend
his
own
property
And
I
will
fire
By
God
I
ll
fire
He
ran
off
toward
the
house
Martin
Petrovitch
look
out
If
you
don
t
get
down
I
ll
fire
Fire
away
came
a
husky
voice
from
the
roof
Fire
away
And
meanwhile
here
s
a
little
present
for
you
A
long
plank
flew
up
and
turning
over
twice
in
the
air
came
violently
to
the
earth
just
at
Sletkin
s
feet
He
positively
jumped
into
the
air
while
Harlov
chuckled
Merciful
Jesus
faltered
some
one
behind
me
I
looked
round
Souvenir
Ah
I
thought
he
s
left
off
laughing
now
Sletkin
clutched
a
peasant
who
was
standing
near
by
the
collar
Climb
up
now
climb
up
climb
up
all
of
you
you
devils
he
wailed
shaking
the
man
with
all
his
force
save
my
property
The
peasant
took
a
couple
of
steps
forward
threw
his
head
back
waved
his
arms
shouted
hi
here
master
shifted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
uneasily
and
then
turned
back
A
ladder
bring
a
ladder
Sletkin
addressed
the
other
peasants
Where
are
we
to
get
it
was
heard
in
answer
And
if
we
had
a
ladder
one
voice
pronounced
deliberately
who
d
care
to
climb
up
Not
such
fools
He
d
wring
your
neck
for
you
in
a
twinkling
He
d
kill
one
in
no
time
said
one
young
lad
with
flaxen
hair
and
a
half-idiotic
face
To
be
sure
he
would
the
others
confirmed
It
struck
me
that
even
if
there
had
been
no
obvious
danger
the
peasants
would
yet
have
been
loath
to
carry
out
their
new
owner
s
orders
They
almost
approved
of
Harlov
though
they
were
amazed
at
him
Ugh
you
robbers
moaned
Sletkin
you
shall
all
catch
it
But
at
this
moment
with
a
heavy
rumble
the
last
chimney
came
crashing
down
and
in
the
midst
of
the
cloud
of
yellow
dust
that
flew
up
instantly
Harlov
uttering
a
piercing
shriek
and
lifting
his
bleeding
hands
high
in
the
air
turned
facing
us
Sletkin
pointed
the
gun
at
him
again
Evlampia
pulled
him
back
by
the
elbow
Don
t
interfere
he
snarled
savagely
at
her
And
you
don
t
you
dare
she
answered
and
her
blue
eyes
flashed
menacingly
under
her
scowling
brows
Father
s
pulling
his
house
down
It
s
his
own
You
lie
it
s
ours
You
say
ours
but
I
say
it
s
his
Sletkin
hissed
with
fury
Evlampia
s
eyes
seemed
stabbing
him
in
the
face
Ah
how
d
ye
do
my
delightful
daughter
Harlov
thundered
from
above
How
d
ye
do
Evlampia
Martinovna
How
are
you
getting
on
with
your
sweetheart
Are
your
kisses
sweet
and
your
fondling
Father
rang
out
Evlampia
s
musical
voice
Eh
daughter
answered
Harlov
and
he
came
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
wall
His
face
as
far
as
I
could
make
it
out
wore
a
strange
smile
a
bright
mirthful
and
for
that
very
reason
peculiarly
strange
and
evil
smile
Many
years
later
I
saw
just
the
same
smile
on
the
face
of
a
man
condemned
to
death
Stop
father
come
down
We
are
in
fault
we
give
everything
back
to
you
Come
down
What
do
you
mean
by
disposing
of
what
s
ours
put
in
Sletkin
Evlampia
merely
scowled
more
angrily
I
give
you
back
my
share
I
give
up
everything
Give
over
come
down
father
Forgive
us
forgive
me
Harlov
still
went
on
smiling
It
s
too
late
my
darling
he
said
and
each
of
his
words
rang
out
like
brass
Too
late
your
stony
heart
is
touched
The
rock
s
started
rolling
downhill
there
s
no
holding
it
back
now
And
don
t
look
to
me
now
I
m
a
doomed
man
You
d
do
better
to
look
to
your
Volodka
see
what
a
pretty
fellow
you
ve
picked
out
And
look
to
your
hellish
sister
there
s
her
foxy
nose
yonder
thrust
out
of
the
window
she
s
peering
yonder
after
that
husband
of
hers
No
my
good
friends
you
would
rob
me
of
a
roof
over
my
head
so
I
will
leave
you
not
one
beam
upon
another
With
my
own
hands
I
built
it
with
my
own
hands
I
destroy
it
yes
with
my
hands
alone
See
I
ve
taken
no
axe
to
help
me
He
snorted
at
his
two
open
hands
and
clutched
at
the
centre
beam
again
Enough
father
Evlampia
was
saying
meanwhile
and
her
voice
had
grown
marvellously
caressing
let
bygones
be
bygones
Come
trust
me
you
always
trusted
me
Come
get
down
come
to
me
to
my
little
room
to
my
soft
bed
I
will
dry
you
and
warm
you
I
will
bind
up
your
wounds
see
you
have
torn
your
hands
You
shall
live
with
me
as
in
Christ
s
bosom
food
shall
be
sweet
to
you
and
sleep
sweeter
yet
Come
we
have
done
wrong
yes
we
were
puffed
up
we
have
sinned
come
forgive
Harlov
shook
his
head
Talk
away
Me
believe
you
Never
again
You
ve
murdered
all
trust
in
my
heart
You
ve
murdered
everything
I
was
an
eagle
and
became
a
worm
for
you
and
you
would
you
even
crush
the
worm
Have
done
I
loved
you
you
know
very
well
but
now
you
are
no
daughter
to
me
and
I
m
no
father
to
you
I
m
a
doomed
man
Don
t
meddle
As
for
you
fire
away
coward
mighty
man
of
valour
Harlov
bellowed
suddenly
at
Sletkin
Why
is
it
you
keep
aiming
and
don
t
shoot
Are
you
mindful
of
the
law
if
the
recipient
of
a
gift
commits
an
attempt
upon
the
life
of
the
giver
Harlov
enunciated
distinctly
then
the
giver
is
empowered
to
claim
everything
back
again
Ha
ha
don
t
be
afraid
law-abiding
man
I
d
make
no
claims
I
ll
make
an
end
of
everything
myself
Here
goes
Father
for
the
last
time
Evlampia
besought
him
Silence
Martin
Petrovitch
brother
be
generous
and
forgive
faltered
Souvenir
Father
dear
father
Silence
bitch
shouted
Harlov
At
Souvenir
he
did
not
even
glance
he
merely
spat
in
his
direction
At
that
instant
Kvitsinsky
with
all
his
retinue
in
three
carts
appeared
at
the
gates
The
tired
horses
panted
the
men
jumped
out
one
after
another
into
the
mud
Aha
Harlov
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
An
army
here
it
comes
an
army
A
whole
army
they
re
sending
against
me
Capital
Only
I
give
warning
if
any
one
comes
up
here
to
me
on
the
roof
I
ll
send
him
flying
down
head
over
heels
I
m
an
inhospitable
master
I
don
t
like
visitors
at
wrong
times
No
indeed
He
was
hanging
with
both
hands
on
to
the
front
rafters
of
the
roof
the
so-called
standards
of
the
gable
and
beginning
to
shake
them
violently
Balancing
on
the
edge
of
the
garret
flooring
he
dragged
them
as
it
were
after
him
chanting
rhythmically
like
a
bargeman
One
more
pull
one
more
o-oh
Sletkin
ran
up
to
Kvitsinsky
and
was
beginning
to
whimper
and
pour
out
complaints
The
latter
begged
him
not
to
interfere
and
proceeded
to
carry
out
the
plan
he
had
evolved
He
took
up
his
position
in
front
of
the
house
and
began
by
way
of
diversion
to
explain
to
Harlov
that
what
he
was
about
was
unworthy
of
his
rank
One
more
pull
one
more
chanted
Harlov
That
Natalia
Nikolaevna
was
greatly
displeased
at
his
proceedings
and
had
not
expected
it
of
him
One
more
pull
one
more
o-oh
Harlov
chanted
while
meantime
Kvitsinsky
had
despatched
the
four
sturdiest
and
boldest
of
the
stable-boys
to
the
other
side
of
the
house
to
clamber
up
the
roof
from
behind
Harlov
however
detected
the
plan
of
attack
he
suddenly
left
the
standards
and
ran
quickly
to
the
back
part
of
the
roof
His
appearance
was
so
alarming
that
the
two
stable-boys
who
had
already
got
up
to
the
garret
dropped
instantly
back
again
to
the
ground
by
the
water-pipe
to
the
great
glee
of
the
serf
boys
who
positively
roared
with
laughter
Harlov
shook
his
fist
after
them
and
going
back
to
the
front
part
of
the
house
again
clutched
at
the
standards
and
began
once
more
loosening
them
singing
again
like
a
bargeman
Suddenly
he
stopped
stared
Maximushka
my
dear
my
friend
he
cried
is
it
you
I
looked
round
There
actually
was
Maximka
stepping
out
from
the
crowd
of
peasants
Grinning
and
showing
his
teeth
he
walked
forward
His
master
the
tailor
had
probably
let
him
come
home
for
a
holiday
Climb
up
to
me
Maximushka
my
faithful
servant
Harlov
went
on
together
let
us
rid
ourselves
of
evil
Tartar
folk
of
Lithuanian
thieves
Maximka
still
grinning
promptly
began
climbing
up
the
roof
But
they
seized
him
and
pulled
him
back
goodness
knows
why
possibly
as
an
example
to
the
rest
he
could
hardly
have
been
much
aid
to
Martin
Petrovitch
Oh
all
right
Good
Harlov
pronounced
in
a
voice
of
menace
and
again
he
took
hold
of
the
standards
Vikenty
Osipovitch
with
your
permission
I
ll
shoot
Sletkin
turned
to
Kvitsinsky
more
to
frighten
him
see
than
anything
my
gun
s
only
charged
with
snipe-shot
But
Kvitsinsky
had
not
time
to
answer
him
when
the
front
couple
of
standards
viciously
shaken
in
Harlov
s
iron
hands
heeled
over
with
a
loud
crack
and
crashed
into
the
yard
and
with
it
not
able
to
stop
himself
came
Harlov
too
and
fell
with
a
heavy
thud
on
the
earth
Every
one
shuddered
and
drew
a
deep
breath
Harlov
lay
without
stirring
on
his
breast
and
on
his
back
lay
the
top
central
beam
of
the
roof
which
had
come
down
with
the
falling
gable
s
timbers
They
ran
up
to
Harlov
rolled
the
beam
off
him
turned
him
over
on
his
back
His
face
was
lifeless
there
was
blood
about
his
mouth
he
did
not
seem
to
breathe
The
breath
is
gone
out
of
him
muttered
the
peasants
standing
about
him
They
ran
to
the
well
for
water
brought
a
whole
bucketful
and
drenched
Harlov
s
head
The
mud
and
dust
ran
off
his
face
but
he
looked
as
lifeless
as
ever
They
dragged
up
a
bench
set
it
in
the
house
itself
and
with
difficulty
raising
the
huge
body
of
Martin
Petrovitch
laid
it
there
with
the
head
to
the
wall
The
page
Maximka
approached
fell
on
one
knee
and
his
other
leg
stretched
far
behind
him
in
a
theatrical
way
supported
his
former
master
s
arm
Evlampia
pale
as
death
stood
directly
facing
her
father
her
great
eyes
fastened
immovably
upon
him
Anna
and
Sletkin
did
not
come
near
him
All
were
silent
all
as
it
were
waited
for
something
At
last
we
heard
broken
smacking
noises
in
Harlov
s
throat
as
though
he
were
swallowing
Then
he
feebly
moved
one
his
right
hand
Maximka
supported
the
left
opened
one
the
right
eye
and
slowly
gazing
about
him
as
though
drunken
with
some
fearful
drunkenness
groaned
articulated
stammering
I
m
sma-ashed
and
as
though
after
a
moment
s
thought
added
here
it
is
the
ra
aven
co
olt
The
blood
suddenly
gushed
thickly
from
his
mouth
his
whole
body
began
to
quiver
The
end
I
thought
But
once
more
Harlov
opened
the
same
eye
the
left
eyelid
lay
as
motionless
as
on
a
dead
man
s
face
and
fixing
it
on
Evlampia
he
articulated
hardly
above
a
breath
Well
daugh
ter
you
I
do
not
Kvitsinsky
with
a
sharp
motion
of
his
hand
beckoned
to
the
priest
who
was
still
standing
on
the
step
The
old
man
came
up
his
narrow
cassock
clinging
about
his
feeble
knees
But
suddenly
there
was
a
sort
of
horrible
twitching
in
Harlov
s
legs
and
in
his
stomach
too
an
irregular
contraction
passed
upwards
over
his
face
Evlampia
s
face
seemed
quivering
and
working
in
the
same
way
Maximka
began
crossing
himself
I
was
seized
with
horror
I
ran
out
to
the
gates
squeezed
myself
close
to
them
not
looking
round
A
minute
later
a
soft
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd
behind
my
back
and
I
understood
that
Martin
Petrovitch
was
no
more
His
skull
had
been
fractured
by
the
beam
and
his
ribs
injured
as
it
appeared
at
the
post-mortem
examination
What
had
he
wanted
to
say
to
her
as
he
lay
dying
I
asked
myself
as
I
went
home
on
my
cob
I
do
not
forgive
or
do
not
pardon
The
rain
had
come
on
again
but
I
rode
at
a
walking
pace
I
wanted
to
be
alone
as
long
as
possible
I
wanted
to
give
myself
up
to
my
reflections
unchecked
Souvenir
had
gone
back
in
one
of
the
carts
that
had
come
with
Kvitsinsky
Young
and
frivolous
as
I
was
at
that
time
the
sudden
sweeping
change
not
in
mere
details
only
that
is
invariably
called
forth
in
all
hearts
by
the
coming
of
death
expected
or
unexpected
it
makes
no
difference
its
majesty
its
gravity
and
its
truthfulness
could
not
fail
to
impress
me
I
was
impressed
too
but
for
all
that
my
troubled
childish
eyes
noted
many
things
at
once
they
noted
how
Sletkin
hurriedly
and
furtively
as
though
it
were
something
stolen
popped
the
gun
out
of
sight
how
he
and
his
wife
became
both
of
them
instantly
the
object
of
a
sort
of
unspoken
but
universal
aloofness
To
Evlampia
though
her
fault
was
probably
no
less
than
her
sister
s
this
aloofness
did
not
extend
She
even
aroused
a
certain
sympathy
when
she
fell
at
her
dead
father
s
feet
But
that
she
too
was
guilty
that
was
none
the
less
felt
by
all
The
old
man
was
wronged
said
a
grey-haired
peasant
with
a
big
head
leaning
like
some
ancient
judge
with
both
hands
and
his
beard
on
a
long
staff
on
your
soul
lies
the
sin
You
wronged
him
That
saying
was
at
once
accepted
by
every
one
as
the
final
judgment
The
peasants
sense
of
justice
found
expression
in
it
I
felt
that
at
once
I
noticed
too
that
at
the
first
Sletkin
did
not
dare
to
give
directions
Without
him
they
lifted
up
the
body
and
carried
it
into
the
other
house
Without
asking
him
the
priest
went
for
everything
needful
to
the
church
while
the
village
elder
ran
to
the
village
to
send
off
a
cart
and
horse
to
the
town
Even
Anna
Martinovna
did
not
venture
to
use
her
ordinary
imperious
tone
in
ordering
the
samovar
to
be
brought
for
hot
water
to
wash
the
deceased
Her
orders
were
more
like
an
entreaty
and
she
was
answered
rudely
I
was
absorbed
all
the
while
by
the
question
What
was
it
exactly
he
wanted
to
say
to
his
daughter
Did
he
want
to
forgive
her
or
to
curse
her
Finally
I
decided
that
it
was
forgiveness
Three
days
later
the
funeral
of
Martin
Petrovitch
took
place
The
cost
of
the
ceremony
was
undertaken
by
my
mother
who
was
deeply
grieved
at
his
death
and
gave
orders
that
no
expense
was
to
be
spared
She
did
not
herself
go
to
the
church
because
she
was
unwilling
as
she
said
to
set
eyes
on
those
two
vile
hussies
and
that
nasty
little
Jew
But
she
sent
Kvitsinsky
me
and
Zhitkov
though
from
that
time
forward
she
always
spoke
of
the
latter
as
a
regular
old
woman
Souvenir
she
did
not
admit
to
her
presence
and
was
furious
with
him
for
long
after
saying
that
he
was
the
murderer
of
her
friend
He
felt
his
disgrace
acutely
he
was
continually
running
on
tiptoe
up
and
down
the
room
next
to
the
one
where
my
mother
was
he
gave
himself
up
to
a
sort
of
scared
and
abject
melancholy
shuddering
and
muttering
d
rectly
In
church
and
during
the
procession
Sletkin
struck
me
as
having
recovered
his
self-possession
He
gave
directions
and
bustled
about
in
his
old
way
and
kept
a
greedy
look-out
that
not
a
superfluous
farthing
should
be
spent
though
his
own
pocket
was
not
in
question
Maximka
in
a
new
Cossack
dress
also
a
present
from
my
mother
gave
vent
to
such
tenor
notes
in
the
choir
that
certainly
no
one
could
have
any
doubts
as
to
the
sincerity
of
his
devotion
to
the
deceased
Both
the
sisters
were
duly
attired
in
mourning
but
they
seemed
more
stupefied
than
grieved
especially
Evlampia
Anna
wore
a
meek
Lenten
air
but
made
no
attempt
to
weep
and
was
continually
passing
her
handsome
thin
hand
over
her
hair
and
cheek
Evlampia
seemed
deep
in
thought
all
the
time
The
universal
unbending
alienation
condemnation
which
I
had
noticed
on
the
day
of
Harlov
s
death
I
detected
now
too
on
the
faces
of
all
the
people
in
the
church
in
their
actions
and
their
glances
but
still
more
grave
and
as
it
were
impersonal
It
seemed
as
though
all
those
people
felt
that
the
sin
into
which
the
Harlov
family
had
fallen
this
great
sin
had
gone
now
before
the
presence
of
the
one
righteous
Judge
and
that
for
that
reason
there
was
no
need
now
for
them
to
trouble
themselves
and
be
indignant
They
prayed
devoutly
for
the
soul
of
the
dead
man
whom
in
life
they
had
not
specially
liked
whom
they
had
feared
indeed
Very
abruptly
had
death
overtaken
him
And
it
s
not
as
though
he
had
been
drinking
heavily
brother
said
one
peasant
to
another
in
the
porch
Nay
without
drink
he
was
drunken
indeed
responded
the
other
He
was
cruelly
wronged
the
first
peasant
repeated
the
phrase
that
summed
it
up
Cruelly
wronged
the
others
murmured
after
him
The
deceased
was
a
hard
master
to
you
wasn
t
he
I
asked
a
peasant
whom
I
recognised
as
one
of
Harlov
s
serfs
He
was
a
master
certainly
answered
the
peasant
but
still
he
was
cruelly
wronged
Cruelly
wronged
I
heard
again
in
the
crowd
At
the
grave
too
Evlampia
stood
as
it
were
lost
Thoughts
were
torturing
her
bitter
thoughts
I
noticed
that
Sletkin
who
several
times
addressed
some
remark
to
her
she
treated
as
she
had
once
treated
Zhitkov
and
worse
still
Some
days
later
there
was
a
rumour
all
over
our
neighbourhood
that
Evlampia
Martinovna
had
left
the
home
of
her
fathers
for
ever
leaving
all
the
property
that
came
to
her
to
her
sister
and
brother-in-law
and
only
taking
some
hundreds
of
roubles
So
Anna
s
bought
her
out
it
seems
remarked
my
mother
but
you
and
I
certainly
she
added
addressing
Zhitkov
with
whom
she
was
playing
picquet
he
took
Souvenir
s
place
are
not
skilful
hands
Zhitkov
looked
dejectedly
at
his
mighty
palms
Hands
like
that
Not
skilful
he
seemed
to
be
saying
to
himself
Soon
after
my
mother
and
I
went
to
live
in
Moscow
and
many
years
passed
before
it
was
my
lot
to
behold
Martin
Petrovitch
s
daughters
again
But
I
did
see
them
again
Anna
Martinovna
I
came
across
in
the
most
ordinary
way
After
my
mother
s
death
I
paid
a
visit
to
our
village
where
I
had
not
been
for
over
fifteen
years
and
there
I
received
an
invitation
from
the
mediator
at
that
time
the
process
of
settling
the
boundaries
between
the
peasants
and
their
former
owners
was
taking
place
over
the
whole
of
Russia
with
a
slowness
not
yet
forgotten
to
a
meeting
of
the
other
landowners
of
our
neighbourhood
to
be
held
on
the
estate
of
the
widow
Anna
Sletkin
The
news
that
my
mother
s
nasty
little
Jew
with
the
prune-coloured
eyes
no
longer
existed
in
this
world
caused
me
I
confess
no
regret
whatever
But
it
was
interesting
to
get
a
glimpse
of
his
widow
She
had
the
reputation
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
first-rate
manager
And
so
it
proved
her
estate
and
homestead
and
the
house
itself
I
could
not
help
glancing
at
the
roof
it
was
an
iron
one
all
turned
out
to
be
in
excellent
order
everything
was
neat
clean
tidied-up
where
needful
painted
as
though
its
mistress
were
a
German
Anna
Martinovna
herself
of
course
looked
older
But
the
peculiar
cold
and
as
it
were
wicked
charm
which
had
once
so
fascinated
me
had
not
altogether
left
her
She
was
dressed
in
rustic
fashion
but
elegantly
She
received
us
not
cordially
that
word
was
not
applicable
to
her
but
courteously
and
on
seeing
me
a
witness
of
that
fearful
scene
not
an
eyelash
quivered
She
made
not
the
slightest
reference
to
my
mother
nor
her
father
nor
her
sister
nor
her
husband
She
had
two
daughters
both
very
pretty
slim
young
things
with
charming
little
faces
and
a
bright
and
friendly
expression
in
their
black
eyes
There
was
a
son
too
a
little
like
his
father
but
still
a
boy
to
be
proud
of
During
the
discussions
between
the
landowners
Anna
Martinovna
s
attitude
was
composed
and
dignified
she
showed
no
sign
of
being
specially
obstinate
nor
specially
grasping
But
none
had
a
truer
perception
of
their
own
interests
than
she
of
hers
none
could
more
convincingly
expound
and
defend
their
rights
All
the
laws
pertinent
to
the
case
even
the
Minister
s
circulars
she
had
thoroughly
mastered
She
spoke
little
and
in
a
quiet
voice
but
every
word
she
uttered
was
to
the
point
It
ended
in
our
all
signifying
our
agreement
to
all
her
demands
and
making
concessions
which
we
could
only
marvel
at
ourselves
On
our
way
home
some
of
the
worthy
landowners
even
used
harsh
words
of
themselves
they
all
hummed
and
hawed
and
shook
their
heads
Ah
she
s
got
brains
that
woman
said
one
A
tricky
baggage
put
in
another
less
delicate
proprietor
Smooth
in
word
but
cruel
in
deed
And
a
screw
into
the
bargain
added
a
third
not
a
glass
of
vodka
nor
a
morsel
of
caviare
for
us
what
do
you
think
of
that
What
can
one
expect
of
her
suddenly
croaked
a
gentleman
who
had
been
silent
till
then
every
one
knows
she
poisoned
her
husband
To
my
astonishment
nobody
thought
fit
to
controvert
this
awful
and
certainly
unfounded
charge
I
was
the
more
surprised
at
this
as
in
spite
of
the
slighting
expressions
I
have
reported
all
of
them
felt
respect
for
Anna
Martinovna
not
excluding
the
indelicate
landowner
As
for
the
mediator
he
waxed
positively
eloquent
Put
her
on
a
throne
he
exclaimed
she
d
be
another
Semiramis
or
Catherine
the
Second
The
discipline
among
her
peasants
is
a
perfect
model
The
education
of
her
children
is
model
What
a
head
What
brains
Without
going
into
the
question
of
Semiramis
and
Catherine
there
was
no
doubt
Anna
Martinovna
was
living
a
very
happy
life
Ease
inward
and
external
the
pleasant
serenity
of
spiritual
health
seemed
the
very
atmosphere
about
herself
her
family
all
her
surroundings
How
far
she
had
deserved
such
happiness
that
is
another
question
Such
questions
though
are
only
propounded
in
youth
Everything
in
the
world
good
and
bad
comes
to
man
not
through
his
deserts
but
in
consequence
of
some
as
yet
unknown
but
logical
laws
which
I
will
not
take
upon
myself
to
indicate
though
I
sometimes
