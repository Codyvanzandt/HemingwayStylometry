wonderful
in
her
eyes
and
on
her
lips
'what
hair
I
used
to
have
Do
you
remember
right
down
to
my
knees
It
was
long
before
I
could
make
up
my
mind
to
it
Such
hair
as
it
was
But
how
could
it
be
kept
combed
In
my
state
So
I
had
it
cut
off
Yes
Well
good-bye
master
I
ca
n't
talk
any
more
That
day
before
setting
off
to
shoot
I
had
a
conversation
with
the
village
constable
about
Lukerya
I
learnt
from
him
that
in
the
village
they
called
Lukerya
the
'Living
Relic
that
she
gave
them
no
trouble
however
they
never
heard
complaint
or
repining
from
her
'She
asks
nothing
but
on
the
contrary
she
's
grateful
for
everything
a
gentle
soul
one
must
say
if
any
there
be
Stricken
of
God
so
the
constable
concluded
'for
her
sins
one
must
suppose
but
we
do
not
go
into
that
And
as
for
judging
her
no
no
we
do
not
judge
her
Let
her
be
A
few
weeks
later
I
heard
that
Lukerya
was
dead
So
her
death
had
come
for
her
and
'after
St
Peter
's
day
They
told
me
that
on
the
day
of
her
death
she
kept
hearing
the
sound
of
bells
though
it
was
reckoned
over
five
miles
from
Aleksyevka
to
the
church
and
it
was
a
week-day
Lukerya
however
had
said
that
the
sounds
came
not
from
the
church
but
from
above
Probably
she
did
not
dare
to
say
from
heaven
THE
RATTLING
OF
WHEELS
'I
've
something
to
tell
you
observed
Yermola
coming
into
the
hut
to
see
me
I
had
just
had
dinner
and
was
lying
down
on
a
travelling
bed
to
rest
a
little
after
a
fairly
successful
but
fatiguing
day
of
grouse-shooting
it
was
somewhere
about
the
10th
of
July
and
the
heat
was
terrific
'I
've
something
to
tell
you
all
our
shot
's
gone
I
jumped
off
the
bed
'All
gone
How
's
that
Why
we
took
pretty
nearly
thirty
pounds
with
us
from
the
village
a
whole
bag
'That
's
so
and
a
big
bag
it
was
enough
for
a
fortnight
But
there
's
no
knowing
There
must
have
been
a
hole
come
in
it
or
something
anyway
there
's
no
shot
that
's
to
say
there
's
enough
for
ten
charges
left
'What
are
we
to
do
now
The
very
best
places
are
before
us
we're
promised
six
coveys
for
to-morrow
'Well
send
me
to
Tula
It
's
not
so
far
from
here
only
forty
miles
I
'll
fly
like
the
wind
and
bring
forty
pounds
of
shot
if
you
say
the
word
'But
when
would
you
go
'Why
directly
Why
put
it
off
Only
I
say
we
shall
have
to
hire
horses
'Why
hire
horses
Why
not
our
own
'We
ca
n't
drive
there
with
our
own
The
shaft
horse
has
gone
lame
terribly
'Since
when
's
that
'Well
the
other
day
the
coachman
took
him
to
be
shod
So
he
was
shod
and
the
blacksmith
I
suppose
was
clumsy
Now
he
ca
n't
even
step
on
the
hoof
It
's
a
front
leg
He
lifts
it
up
like
a
dog
'Well
they
've
taken
the
shoe
off
I
suppose
at
least
'No
they
've
not
but
of
course
they
ought
to
take
it
off
A
nail's
been
driven
right
into
the
flesh
I
should
say
I
ordered
the
coachman
to
be
summoned
It
turned
out
that
Yermola
had
spoken
the
truth
the
shaft-horse
really
could
not
put
its
hoof
to
the
ground
I
promptly
gave
orders
for
it
to
have
the
shoe
taken
off
and
to
be
stood
on
damp
clay
'Then
do
you
wish
me
to
hire
horses
to
go
to
Tula
Yermola
persisted
'Do
you
suppose
we
can
get
horses
in
this
wilderness
I
exclaimed
with
involuntary
irritation
The
village
in
which
we
found
ourselves
was
a
desolate
God-forsaken
place
all
its
inhabitants
seemed
to
be
poverty-stricken
we
had
difficulty
in
discovering
one
hut
moderately
roomy
and
even
that
one
had
no
chimney
'Yes
replied
Yermola
with
his
habitual
equanimity
'what
you
said
about
this
village
is
true
enough
but
there
used
to
be
living
in
this
very
place
one
peasant
a
very
clever
fellow
rich
too
He
had
nine
horses
He
's
dead
and
his
eldest
son
manages
it
all
now
The
man
's
a
perfect
fool
but
still
he
's
not
had
time
to
waste
his
father
's
wealth
yet
We
can
get
horses
from
him
If
you
say
the
word
I
will
fetch
him
His
brothers
I
've
heard
say
are
smart
chaps
but
still
he
's
their
head
'Why
so
'Because
he
's
the
eldest
Of
course
the
younger
ones
must
obey
Here
Yermola
in
reference
to
younger
brothers
as
a
class
expressed
himself
with
a
vigour
quite
unsuitable
for
print
'I
'll
fetch
him
He
's
a
simple
fellow
With
him
you
ca
n't
fail
to
come
to
terms
While
Yermola
went
after
his
'simple
fellow
the
idea
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
be
better
for
me
to
drive
into
Tula
myself
In
the
first
place
taught
by
experience
I
had
no
very
great
confidence
in
Yermola
I
had
once
sent
him
to
the
town
for
purchases
he
had
promised
to
get
through
all
my
commissions
in
one
day
and
was
gone
a
whole
week
drank
up
all
the
money
and
came
back
on
foot
though
he
had
set
off
in
my
racing
droshky
And
secondly
I
had
an
acquaintance
in
Tula
a
horsedealer
I
might
buy
a
horse
off
him
to
take
the
place
of
the
disabled
shaft-horse
'The
thing
's
decided
I
thought
'I
'll
drive
over
myself
I
can
sleep
just
as
well
on
the
road
luckily
the
coach
is
comfortable
'I
've
brought
him
cried
Yermola
rushing
into
the
hut
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
He
was
followed
by
a
tall
peasant
in
a
white
shirt
blue
breeches
and
bast
shoes
with
white
eyebrows
and
short-sighted
eyes
a
wedge-shaped
red
beard
a
long
swollen
nose
and
a
gaping
mouth
He
certainly
did
look
'simple
'Here
your
honour
observed
Yermola
'he
has
horses
and
he's
willing
'So
be
surely
I
the
peasant
began
hesitatingly
in
a
rather
hoarse
voice
shaking
his
thin
wisps
of
hair
and
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
the
band
of
the
cap
he
held
in
his
hands
'Surely
I
'What
's
your
name
I
inquired
The
peasant
looked
down
and
seemed
to
think
deeply
'My
name
'Yes
what
are
you
called
'Why
my
name
'ull
be
Filofey
'Well
then
friend
Filofey
I
hear
you
have
horses
Bring
a
team
of
three
here
we
'll
put
them
in
my
coach
it
's
a
light
one
and
you
drive
me
in
to
Tula
There
's
a
moon
now
at
night
it
's
light
and
it
's
cool
for
driving
What
sort
of
a
road
have
you
here
'The
road
There
's
naught
amiss
with
the
road
To
the
main
road
it
will
be
sixteen
miles
not
more
There
's
one
little
place
a
bit
awkward
but
naught
amiss
else
'What
sort
of
little
place
is
it
that
's
awkward
'Well
we
'll
have
to
cross
the
river
by
the
ford
'But
are
you
thinking
of
going
to
Tula
yourself
inquired
Yermola
'Yes
'Oh
commented
my
faithful
servant
with
a
shake
of
his
head
'Oh-oh
he
repeated
then
he
spat
on
the
floor
and
walked
out
of
the
room
The
expedition
to
Tula
obviously
no
longer
presented
any
features
of
interest
to
him
it
had
become
for
him
a
dull
and
unattractive
business
'Do
you
know
the
road
well
I
said
addressing
Filofey
'Surely
we
know
the
road
Only
so
to
say
please
your
honour
ca
n't
so
on
the
sudden
so
to
say
It
appeared
that
Yermola
on
engaging
Filofey
had
stated
that
he
could
be
sure
that
fool
as
he
was
he
'd
be
paid
and
nothing
more
Filofey
fool
as
he
was
in
Yermola
's
words
was
not
satisfied
with
this
statement
alone
He
demanded
of
me
fifty
roubles
an
exorbitant
price
I
offered
him
ten
a
low
price
We
fell
to
haggling
Filofey
at
first
was
stubborn
then
he
began
to
come
down
but
slowly
Yermola
entering
for
an
instant
began
assuring
me
'that
fool
'He
's
fond
of
the
word
seemingly
Filofey
remarked
in
a
low
voice
'that
fool
can't
reckon
money
at
all
and
reminded
me
how
twenty
years
ago
a
posting
tavern
established
by
my
mother
at
the
crossing
of
two
high-roads
came
to
complete
grief
from
the
fact
that
the
old
house-serf
who
was
put
there
to
manage
it
positively
did
not
understand
reckoning
money
but
valued
sums
simply
by
the
number
of
coins
in
fact
gave
silver
coins
in
change
for
copper
though
he
would
swear
furiously
all
the
time
'Ugh
you
Filofey
you
're
a
regular
Filofey
Yermola
jeered
at
last
and
he
went
out
slamming
the
door
angrily
Filofey
made
him
no
reply
as
though
admitting
that
to
be
called
Filofey
was
as
a
fact
not
very
clever
of
him
and
that
a
man
might
fairly
be
reproached
for
such
a
name
though
really
it
was
the
village
priest
was
to
blame
in
the
matter
for
not
having
done
better
by
him
at
his
christening
At
last
we
agreed
however
on
the
sum
of
twenty
roubles
He
went
off
for
the
horses
and
an
hour
later
brought
five
for
me
to
choose
from
The
horses
turned
out
to
be
fairly
good
though
their
manes
and
tails
were
tangled
and
their
bellies
round
and
taut
as
drums
With
Filofey
came
two
of
his
brothers
not
in
the
least
like
him
Little
black-eyed
sharp-nosed
fellows
they
certainly
produced
the
impression
of
'smart
chaps
they
talked
a
great
deal
very
fast
'clacked
away
as
Yermola
expressed
it
but
obeyed
the
elder
brother
They
dragged
the
coach
out
of
the
shed
and
were
busy
about
it
and
the
horses
for
an
hour
and
a
half
first
they
let
out
the
traces
which
were
of
cord
then
pulled
them
too
tight
again
Both
brothers
were
very
much
set
on
harnessing
the
'roan
in
the
shafts
because
'him
can
do
best
going
down-hill
but
Filofey
decided
for
'the
shaggy
one
So
the
shaggy
one
was
put
in
the
shafts
accordingly
They
heaped
the
coach
up
with
hay
put
the
collar
off
the
lame
shaft-horse
under
the
seat
in
case
we
might
want
to
fit
it
on
to
the
horse
to
be
bought
at
Tula
Filofey
who
had
managed
to
run
home
and
come
back
in
a
long
white
loose
ancestral
overcoat
a
high
sugar-loaf
cap
and
tarred
boots
clambered
triumphantly
up
on
to
the
box
I
took
my
seat
looking
at
my
watch
it
was
a
quarter
past
ten
Yermola
did
not
even
say
good-bye
to
me
he
was
engaged
in
beating
his
Valetka
Filofey
tugged
at
the
reins
and
shouted
in
a
thin
thin
voice
'Hey
you
little
ones
His
brothers
skipped
away
on
both
sides
lashed
the
trace-horses
under
the
belly
and
the
coach
started
turned
out
of
the
gates
into
the
street
the
shaggy
one
tried
to
turn
off
towards
his
own
home
but
Filofey
brought
him
to
reason
with
a
few
strokes
of
the
whip
and
behold
we
were
already
out
of
the
village
and
rolling
along
a
fairly
even
road
between
close-growing
bushes
of
thick
hazels
It
was
a
still
glorious
night
the
very
nicest
for
driving
A
breeze
rustled
now
and
then
in
the
bushes
set
the
twigs
swinging
and
died
away
again
in
the
sky
could
be
seen
motionless
silvery
clouds
the
moon
stood
high
and
threw
a
bright
light
on
all
around
I
stretched
myself
on
the
hay
and
was
just
beginning
to
doze
but
I
remembered
the
'awkward
place
and
started
up
'I
say
Filofey
is
it
far
to
the
ford
'To
the
ford
It
'll
be
near
upon
seven
miles
'Seven
miles
I
mused
'We
sha
n't
get
there
for
another
hour
I
can
have
a
nap
meanwhile
Filofey
do
you
know
the
road
well
I
asked
again
'Surely
how
could
I
fail
to
know
it
It
's
not
the
first
time
I've
driven
He
said
something
more
but
I
had
ceased
to
listen
I
was
asleep
I
was
awakened
not
as
often
happens
by
my
own
intention
of
waking
in
exactly
an
hour
but
by
a
sort
of
strange
though
faint
lapping
gurgling
sound
at
my
very
ear
I
raised
my
head
Wonderful
to
relate
I
was
lying
in
the
coach
as
before
but
all
round
the
coach
half
a
foot
not
more
from
its
edge
a
sheet
of
water
lay
shining
in
the
moonlight
broken
up
into
tiny
distinct
quivering
eddies
I
looked
in
front
On
the
box
with
back
bowed
and
head
bent
Filofey
was
sitting
like
a
statue
and
a
little
further
on
above
the
rippling
water
I
saw
the
curved
arch
of
the
yoke
and
the
horses
heads
and
backs
And
everything
as
motionless
as
noiseless
as
though
in
some
enchanted
realm
in
a
dream
a
dream
of
fairyland
'What
does
it
mean
I
looked
back
from
under
the
hood
of
the
coach
'Why
we
are
in
the
middle
of
the
river
the
bank
was
thirty
paces
from
us
'Filofey
I
cried
'What
he
answered
'What
indeed
Upon
my
word
Where
are
we
'In
the
river
'I
see
we
're
in
the
river
But
like
this
we
shall
be
drowned
directly
Is
this
how
you
cross
the
ford
Eh
Why
you
're
asleep
Filofey
Answer
do
'I
've
made
a
little
mistake
observed
my
guide
'I
've
gone
to
one
side
a
bit
wrong
but
now
we
've
got
to
wait
a
bit
'Got
to
wait
a
bit
What
ever
are
we
going
to
wait
for
'Well
we
must
let
the
shaggy
one
look
about
him
which
way
he
turns
his
head
that
way
we
've
got
to
go
I
raised
myself
on
the
hay
The
shaft-horse
's
head
stood
quite
motionless
Above
the
head
one
could
only
see
in
the
bright
moonlight
one
ear
slightly
twitching
backwards
and
forwards
'Why
he
's
asleep
too
your
shaggy
one
'No
responded
Filofey
'he
's
sniffing
the
water
now
And
everything
was
still
again
there
was
only
the
faint
gurgle
of
the
water
as
before
I
sank
into
a
state
of
torpor
Moonlight
and
night
and
the
river
and
we
in
it
'What
is
that
croaking
noise
I
asked
Filofey
'That
Ducks
in
the
reeds
or
else
snakes
All
of
a
sudden
the
head
of
the
shaft-horse
shook
his
ears
pricked
up
he
gave
a
snort
began
to
move
'Ho-ho
ho-ho-o
Filofey
began
suddenly
bawling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
he
sat
up
and
brandished
the
whip
The
coach
was
at
once
tugged
away
from
where
it
had
stuck
it
plunged
forward
cleaving
the
waters
of
the
river
and
moved
along
swaying
and
lurching
from
side
to
side
At
first
it
seemed
to
me
we
were
sinking
getting
deeper
however
after
two
or
three
tugs
and
jolts
the
expanse
of
water
seemed
suddenly
lower
It
got
lower
and
lower
the
coach
seemed
to
grow
up
out
of
it
and
now
the
wheels
and
the
horses
tails
could
be
seen
and
now
stirring
with
a
mighty
splashing
of
big
drops
scattering
showers
of
diamonds
no
not
diamonds
sapphires
in
the
dull
brilliance
of
the
moon
the
horses
with
a
spirited
pull
all
together
drew
us
on
to
the
sandy
bank
and
trotted
along
the
road
to
the
hill-side
their
shining
white
legs
flashing
in
rivalry
'What
will
Filofey
say
now
was
the
thought
that
glanced
through
my
mind
'you
see
I
was
right
or
something
of
that
sort
But
he
said
nothing
So
I
too
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
reproach
him
for
carelessness
and
lying
down
in
the
hay
I
tried
again
to
go
to
sleep
But
I
could
not
go
to
sleep
not
because
I
was
not
tired
from
hunting
and
not
because
the
exciting
experience
I
had
just
been
through
had
dispelled
my
sleepiness
it
was
that
we
were
driving
through
such
very
beautiful
country
There
were
liberal
wide-stretching
grassy
riverside
meadows
with
a
multitude
of
small
pools
little
lakes
rivulets
creeks
overgrown
at
the
ends
with
branches
and
osiers
a
regular
Russian
scene
such
as
Russians
love
like
the
scenes
amid
which
the
heroes
of
our
old
legends
rode
out
to
shoot
white
swans
and
grey
ducks
The
road
we
were
driven
along
wound
in
a
yellowish
ribbon
the
horses
ran
lightly
and
I
could
not
close
my
eyes
I
was
admiring
And
it
all
floated
by
softened
into
harmony
under
the
kindly
light
of
the
moon
Filofey
he
too
was
touched
by
it
'Those
meadows
are
called
St
Yegor
's
he
said
turning
to
me
'And
beyond
them
come
the
Grand
Duke
's
there
are
no
other
meadows
like
them
in
all
Russia
Ah
it
's
lovely
The
shaft-horse
snorted
and
shook
itself
'God
bless
you
commented
Filofey
gravely
in
an
undertone
'How
lovely
he
repeated
with
a
sigh
then
he
gave
a
long
sort
of
grunt
'There
mowing
time
's
just
upon
us
and
think
what
hay
they'll
rake
up
there
regular
mountains
And
there
are
lots
of
fish
in
the
creeks
Such
bream
he
added
in
a
sing-song
voice
'In
one
word
life's
sweet
one
does
n't
want
to
die
He
suddenly
raised
his
hand
'Hullo
look-ee
over
the
lake
is
it
a
crane
standing
there
Can
it
be
fishing
at
night
Bless
me
it
's
a
branch
not
a
crane
Well
that
was
a
mistake
But
the
moon
is
always
so
deceptive
So
we
drove
on
and
on
But
now
the
end
of
the
meadows
had
been
reached
little
copses
and
ploughed
fields
came
into
view
a
little
village
flashed
with
two
or
three
lights
on
one
side
it
was
only
four
miles
now
to
the
main
road
I
fell
asleep
Again
I
did
not
wake
up
of
my
own
accord
This
time
I
was
roused
by
the
voice
of
Filofey
'Master
hey
master
I
sat
up
The
coach
was
standing
still
on
level
ground
in
the
very
middle
of
the
high-road
Filofey
who
had
turned
round
on
the
box
so
as
to
face
me
with
wide-open
eyes
I
was
positively
surprised
at
them
I
could
n't
have
imagined
he
had
such
large
eyes
was
whispering
with
mysterious
significance
'A
rattle
a
rattle
of
wheels
'What
do
you
say
'I
say
there
's
a
rattling
Bend
down
and
listen
Do
you
hear
it
I
put
my
head
out
of
the
coach
held
my
breath
and
did
catch
somewhere
in
the
distance
far
behind
us
a
faint
broken
sound
as
of
wheels
rolling
'Do
you
hear
it
repeated
Filofey
'Well
yes
I
answered
'Some
vehicle
is
coming
'Oh
you
do
n't
hear
shoo
The
tambourines
and
whistling
too
Do
you
hear
Take
off
your
cap
you
will
hear
better
I
did
n't
take
off
my
cap
but
I
listened
'Well
yes
perhaps
But
what
of
it
Filofey
turned
round
facing
the
horses
'It
's
a
cart
coming
lightly
iron-rimmed
wheels
he
observed
and
he
took
up
the
reins
'It
's
wicked
folks
coming
master
hereabouts
you
know
near
Tula
they
play
a
good
many
tricks
'What
nonsense
What
makes
you
suppose
it
's
sure
to
be
wicked
people
'I
speak
the
truth
with
tambourines
and
in
an
empty
cart
Who
should
it
be
'Well
is
it
much
further
to
Tula
'There
's
twelve
miles
further
to
go
and
not
a
habitation
here
'Well
then
get
on
quicker
it
's
no
good
lingering
Filofey
brandished
the
whip
and
the
coach
rolled
on
again
Though
I
did
not
put
much
faith
in
Filofey
I
could
not
go
to
sleep
'What
if
it
really
is
so
A
disagreeable
sensation
began
to
stir
in
me
I
sat
up
in
the
coach
till
then
I
had
lain
down
and
began
looking
in
all
directions
While
I
had
been
asleep
a
slight
fog
had
come
over
not
the
earth
but
the
sky
it
stood
high
the
moon
hung
a
whitish
patch
in
it
as
though
in
smoke
Everything
had
grown
dim
and
blended
together
though
it
was
clearer
near
the
ground
Around
us
flat
dreary
country
fields
nothing
but
fields
here
and
there
bushes
and
ravines
and
again
fields
mostly
fallow
with
scanty
dusty
grass
A
wilderness
deathlike
If
only
a
quail
had
called
We
drove
on
for
half
an
hour
Filofey
kept
constantly
cracking
his
whip
and
clicking
with
his
lips
but
neither
he
nor
I
uttered
a
word
So
we
mounted
the
hillside
Filofey
pulled
up
the
horses
and
promptly
said
again
'It
is
a
rattle
of
wheels
master
yes
it
is
I
poked
my
head
out
of
the
coach
again
but
I
might
have
stayed
under
the
cover
of
the
hood
so
distinctly
though
still
from
a
distance
the
sound
reached
me
of
cart-wheels
men
whistling
the
jingling
of
tambourines
and
even
the
thud
of
horses
hoofs
I
even
fancied
I
could
hear
singing
and
laughter
The
wind
it
is
true
was
blowing
from
there
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
unknown
travellers
were
a
good
mile
perhaps
two
nearer
us
Filofey
and
I
looked
at
one
another
he
only
gave
his
hat
a
tweak
forward
from
behind
and
at
once
bending
over
the
reins
fell
to
whipping
up
the
horses
They
set
off
at
a
gallop
but
they
could
not
gallop
for
long
and
fell
back
into
a
trot
again
Filofey
continued
to
whip
them
We
must
get
away
I
ca
n't
account
for
the
fact
that
though
I
had
not
at
first
shared
Filofey
's
apprehensions
about
this
time
I
suddenly
gained
the
conviction
that
we
really
were
being
followed
by
highwaymen
I
had
heard
nothing
new
the
same
tambourines
the
same
rattle
of
a
cart
without
a
load
the
same
intermittent
whistling
the
same
confused
uproar
But
now
I
had
no
doubt
Filofey
could
not
have
made
a
mistake
And
now
twenty
minutes
more
had
gone
by
During
the
last
of
these
twenty
minutes
even
through
the
clatter
and
rumble
of
our
own
carriage
we
could
hear
another
clatter
and
another
rumbling
'Stop
Filofey
I
said
'it
's
no
use
the
end
's
the
same
Filofey
uttered
a
faint-hearted
'wo
The
horses
instantaneously
stopped
as
though
delighted
at
the
chance
of
resting
Mercy
upon
us
the
tambourines
were
simply
booming
away
just
behind
our
backs
the
cart
was
rattling
and
creaking
the
men
were
whistling
shouting
and
singing
the
horses
were
snorting
and
thumping
on
the
ground
with
their
hoofs
They
had
overtaken
us
'Bad
luck
Filofey
commented
in
an
emphatic
undertone
and
clicking
to
the
horses
irresolutely
he
began
to
urge
them
on
again
But
at
that
very
instant
there
was
a
sort
of
sudden
rush
and
whizz
and
a
very
big
wide
cart
harnessed
with
three
lean
horses
cut
sharply
at
a
rush
up
to
us
galloped
in
front
and
at
once
fell
into
a
walking
pace
blocking
up
the
road
'A
regular
brigand
's
trick
murmured
Filofey
I
must
own
I
felt
a
cold
chill
at
my
heart
I
fell
to
staring
before
me
with
strained
attention
in
the
half-darkness
of
the
misty
moonlight
In
the
cart
in
front
of
us
were
half-lying
half-sitting
six
men
in
shirts
and
in
unbuttoned
rough
overcoats
two
of
them
had
no
caps
on
huge
feet
in
boots
were
swinging
and
hanging
over
the
cart-rail
arms
were
rising
and
falling
helter-skelter
bodies
were
jolting
backwards
and
forwards
It
was
quite
clear
a
drunken
party
Some
were
bawling
at
random
one
was
whistling
very
correctly
and
shrilly
another
was
swearing
on
the
driver
's
seat
sat
a
sort
of
giant
in
a
cape
driving
They
went
at
a
walking
pace
as
though
paying
no
attention
to
us
What
was
to
be
done
We
followed
them
also
at
a
walking
pace
we
could
do
nothing
else
For
a
quarter
of
a
mile
we
moved
along
in
this
manner
The
suspense
was
torturing
To
protect
to
defend
ourselves
was
out
of
the
question
There
were
six
of
them
and
I
had
n't
even
a
stick
Should
we
turn
back
But
they
would
catch
us
up
directly
I
remembered
the
line
of
Zhukovsky
in
the
passage
where
he
speaks
of
the
murder
of
field-marshal
Kamensky
'The
scoundrel
highwayman
's
vile
axe
Or
else
strangling
with
filthy
cord
flung
into
a
ditch
there
to
choke
and
struggle
like
a
hare
in
a
trap
Ugh
it
was
horrid
And
they
as
before
went
on
at
a
walking
pace
taking
no
notice
of
us
'Filofey
I
whispered
'just
try
keep
more
to
the
right
see
if
you
can
get
by
Filofey
tried
kept
to
the
right
but
they
promptly
kept
to
the
right
too
It
was
impossible
to
get
by
Filofey
made
another
effort
he
kept
to
the
left
But
there
again
they
did
not
let
him
pass
the
cart
They
even
laughed
aloud
That
meant
that
they
would
n't
let
us
pass
'Then
they
are
a
bad
lot
Filofey
whispered
to
me
over
his
shoulder
'But
what
are
they
waiting
for
I
inquired
also
in
a
whisper
'To
reach
the
bridge
over
there
in
front
in
the
hollow
above
the
stream
They
'll
do
for
us
there
That
's
always
their
way
by
bridges
It
's
a
clear
case
for
us
master
He
added
with
a
sigh
'They
'll
hardly
let
us
go
alive
for
the
great
thing
for
them
is
to
keep
it
all
dark
I
'm
sorry
for
one
thing
master
my
horses
are
lost
and
my
brothers
wo
n't
get
them
I
should
have
been
surprised
at
the
time
that
Filofey
could
still
trouble
about
his
horses
at
such
a
moment
but
I
must
confess
I
had
no
thoughts
for
him
'Will
they
really
kill
me
I
kept
repeating
mentally
'Why
should
they
I
'll
give
them
everything
I
have
And
the
bridge
was
getting
nearer
and
nearer
it
could
be
more
and
more
clearly
seen
Suddenly
a
sharp
whoop
was
heard
the
cart
before
us
as
it
were
flew
ahead
dashed
along
and
reaching
the
bridge
at
once
stopped
stock-still
a
little
on
one
side
of
the
road
My
heart
fairly
sank
like
lead
'Ah
brother
Filofey
I
said
'we
are
going
to
our
death
Forgive
me
for
bringing
you
to
ruin
'As
though
it
were
your
fault
master
There
's
no
escaping
one
's
fate
Come
Shaggy
my
trusty
little
horse
Filofey
addressed
the
shaft-horse
'step
on
brother
Do
your
last
bit
of
service
It
's
all
the
same
And
he
urged
his
horses
into
a
trot
We
began
to
get
near
the
bridge
near
that
motionless
menacing
cart
In
it
everything
was
silent
as
though
on
purpose
Not
a
single
halloo
It
was
the
stillness
of
the
pike
or
the
hawk
of
every
beast
of
prey
as
its
victim
approaches
And
now
we
were
level
with
the
cart
Suddenly
the
giant
in
the
cape
sprang
out
of
the
cart
and
came
straight
towards
us
He
said
nothing
to
Filofey
but
the
latter
of
his
own
accord
tugged
at
the
reins
The
coach
stopped
The
giant
laid
both
arms
on
the
carriage
door
and
bending
forward
his
shaggy
head
with
a
grin
he
uttered
the
following
speech
in
a
soft
even
voice
with
the
accent
of
a
factory
hand
'Honoured
sir
we
are
coming
from
an
honest
feast
from
a
wedding
we've
been
marrying
one
of
our
fine
fellows
that
is
we
've
put
him
to
bed
we
're
all
young
lads
reckless
chaps
there
's
been
a
good
deal
of
drinking
and
nothing
to
sober
us
so
would
n't
your
honour
be
so
good
as
to
favour
us
the
least
little
just
for
a
dram
of
brandy
for
our
mate
We
'd
drink
to
your
health
and
remember
your
worship
but
if
you
won't
be
gracious
to
us
well
we
beg
you
not
to
be
angry
'What
's
the
meaning
of
this
I
thought
'A
joke
a
jeer
The
giant
continued
to
stand
with
bent
head
At
that
very
instant
the
moon
emerged
from
the
fog
and
lighted
up
his
face
There
was
a
grin
on
the
face
in
the
eyes
and
on
the
lips
But
there
was
nothing
threatening
to
be
seen
in
it
only
it
seemed
as
it
were
all
on
the
alert
and
the
teeth
were
so
white
and
large
'I
shall
be
pleased
take
this
I
said
hurriedly
and
pulling
my
purse
out
of
my
pocket
I
took
out
two
silver
roubles
at
that
time
silver
was
still
circulating
in
Russia
'here
if
that
's
enough
'Much
obliged
bawled
the
giant
in
military
fashion
and
his
fat
fingers
in
a
flash
snatched
from
me
not
the
whole
purse
but
only
the
two
roubles
'much
obliged
He
shook
his
hair
back
and
ran
up
to
the
cart
'Lads
he
shouted
'the
gentleman
makes
us
a
present
of
two
silver
roubles
They
all
began
as
it
were
gabbling
at
once
The
giant
rolled
up
on
to
the
driver
's
seat
'Good
luck
to
you
master
And
that
was
the
last
we
saw
of
them
The
horses
dashed
on
the
cart
rumbled
up
the
hill
once
more
it
stood
out
on
the
dark
line
separating
the
earth
from
the
sky
went
down
and
vanished
And
now
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
the
shouts
and
tambourines
could
not
be
heard
There
was
a
death-like
silence
Filofey
and
I
could
not
recover
ourselves
all
at
once
'Ah
you
're
a
merry
fellow
he
commented
at
last
and
taking
off
his
hat
he
began
crossing
himself
'Fond
of
a
joke
on
my
word
he
added
and
he
turned
to
me
beaming
all
over
'But
he
must
be
a
capital
fellow
on
my
word
Now
now
now
little
ones
look
alive
You
're
safe
We
are
all
safe
It
was
he
who
would
n't
let
us
get
by
it
was
he
who
drove
the
horses
What
