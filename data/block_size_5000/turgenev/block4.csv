on
the
bench
said
Yefrem
Run
away
you
little
rascals
he
cried
to
three
other
children
who
suddenly
came
out
of
different
corners
of
the
room
together
with
two
lean
cats
covered
with
wood
ashes
Get
along
Sh-sh
Come
this
way
Akim
Semyonitch
this
way
he
went
on
making
his
guest
sit
down
and
wo
n't
you
take
something
I
tell
you
what
Yefrem
Akim
articulated
at
last
could
I
have
some
vodka
Yefrem
pricked
up
his
ears
Vodka
You
can
I
've
none
in
the
house
but
I
will
run
this
minute
to
Father
Fyodor
's
He
always
has
it
I
'll
be
back
in
no
time
And
he
snatched
up
his
cap
with
earflaps
Bring
plenty
I
'll
pay
for
it
Akim
shouted
after
him
I
've
still
money
enough
for
that
I
'll
be
back
in
no
time
Yefrem
repeated
again
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
He
certainly
did
return
very
quickly
with
two
bottles
under
his
arm
of
which
one
was
already
uncorked
put
them
on
the
table
brought
two
little
green
glasses
part
of
a
loaf
and
some
salt
Now
this
is
what
I
like
he
kept
repeating
as
he
sat
down
opposite
Akim
Why
grieve
He
poured
out
a
glass
for
Akim
and
another
for
himself
and
began
talking
freely
Avdotya
's
conduct
had
perplexed
him
It
's
a
strange
business
really
he
said
how
did
it
happen
He
must
have
bewitched
her
I
suppose
It
shows
how
strictly
one
must
look
after
a
wife
You
want
to
keep
a
firm
hand
over
her
All
the
same
it
would
n't
be
amiss
for
you
to
go
home
I
expect
you
have
got
a
lot
of
belongings
there
still
Yefrem
added
much
more
to
the
same
effect
he
did
not
like
to
be
silent
when
he
was
drinking
This
is
what
was
happening
an
hour
later
in
Yefrem
's
house
Akim
who
had
not
answered
a
word
to
the
questions
and
observations
of
his
talkative
host
but
had
merely
gone
on
drinking
glass
after
glass
was
sleeping
on
the
stove
crimson
in
the
face
a
heavy
oppressive
sleep
the
children
were
looking
at
him
in
wonder
and
Yefrem
Yefrem
alas
was
asleep
too
but
in
a
cold
little
lumber
room
in
which
he
had
been
locked
by
his
wife
a
woman
of
very
masculine
and
powerful
physique
He
had
gone
to
her
in
the
shed
and
begun
threatening
her
or
telling
her
some
tale
but
had
expressed
himself
so
unintelligibly
and
incoherently
that
she
instantly
saw
what
was
the
matter
took
him
by
the
collar
and
deposited
him
in
a
suitable
place
He
slept
in
the
lumber
room
however
very
soundly
and
even
serenely
Such
is
the
effect
of
habit
Kirillovna
had
not
quite
accurately
repeated
to
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
her
conversation
with
Akim
the
same
may
be
said
of
Avdotya
Naum
had
not
turned
her
out
though
she
had
told
Akim
that
he
had
he
had
no
right
to
turn
her
out
He
was
bound
to
give
the
former
owners
time
to
pack
up
An
explanation
of
quite
a
different
character
took
place
between
him
and
Avdotya
When
Akim
had
rushed
out
crying
that
he
would
go
to
the
mistress
Avdotya
had
turned
to
Naum
stared
at
him
open-eyed
and
clasped
her
hands
Good
heavens
she
cried
Naum
Ivanitch
what
does
this
mean
You've
bought
our
inn
Well
what
of
it
he
replied
I
have
Avdotya
was
silent
for
a
while
then
she
suddenly
started
So
that
is
what
you
wanted
the
money
for
You
are
quite
right
there
Hullo
I
believe
your
husband
has
gone
off
with
my
horse
he
added
hearing
the
rumble
of
the
wheels
He
is
a
smart
fellow
But
it
's
robbery
wailed
Avdotya
Why
it
's
our
money
my
husband's
money
and
the
inn
is
ours
No
Avdotya
Arefyevna
Naum
interrupted
her
the
inn
was
not
yours
What
's
the
use
of
saying
that
The
inn
was
on
your
mistress
's
land
so
it
was
hers
The
money
was
yours
certainly
but
you
were
so
to
say
so
kind
as
to
present
it
to
me
and
I
am
grateful
to
you
and
will
even
give
it
back
to
you
on
occasion
if
occasion
arises
but
you
wouldn't
expect
me
to
remain
a
beggar
would
you
Naum
said
all
this
very
calmly
and
even
with
a
slight
smile
Holy
saints
cried
Avdotya
it
's
beyond
everything
Beyond
everything
How
can
I
look
my
husband
in
the
face
after
this
You
villain
she
added
looking
with
hatred
at
Naum
's
fresh
young
face
I
've
ruined
my
soul
for
you
I
've
become
a
thief
for
your
sake
why
you
've
turned
us
into
the
street
you
villain
There
's
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
hang
myself
villain
deceiver
You
've
ruined
me
you
monster
And
she
broke
into
violent
sobbing
Do
n't
excite
yourself
Avdotya
Arefyevna
said
Naum
I
'll
tell
you
one
thing
charity
begins
at
home
and
that
's
what
the
pike
is
in
the
sea
for
to
keep
the
carp
from
going
to
sleep
Where
are
we
to
go
now
What
's
to
become
of
us
Avdotya
faltered
weeping
That
I
ca
n't
say
But
I
'll
cut
your
throat
you
villain
I
'll
cut
your
throat
No
you
wo
n't
do
that
Avdotya
Arefyevna
what
's
the
use
of
talking
like
that
But
I
see
I
had
better
leave
you
for
a
time
for
you
are
very
much
upset
I
'll
say
good-bye
but
I
shall
be
back
to-morrow
for
certain
But
you
must
allow
me
to
send
my
workmen
here
today
he
added
while
Avdotya
went
on
repeating
through
her
tears
that
she
would
cut
his
throat
and
her
own
Oh
and
here
they
are
he
observed
looking
out
of
the
window
Or
God
forbid
some
mischief
might
happen
It
will
be
safer
so
Will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
put
your
belongings
together
to-day
and
they'll
keep
guard
here
and
help
you
if
you
like
I
'll
say
goodbye
He
bowed
went
out
and
beckoned
the
workmen
to
him
Avdotya
sank
on
the
bench
then
bent
over
the
table
wringing
her
hands
then
suddenly
leapt
up
and
ran
after
her
husband
We
have
described
their
meeting
When
Akim
drove
away
from
her
with
Yefrem
leaving
her
alone
in
the
field
for
a
long
time
she
remained
where
she
was
weeping
When
she
had
wept
away
all
her
tears
she
went
in
the
direction
of
her
mistress
's
house
It
was
very
bitter
for
her
to
go
into
the
house
still
more
bitter
to
go
into
the
maids
room
All
the
maids
flew
to
meet
her
with
sympathy
and
consideration
Seeing
them
Avdotya
could
not
restrain
her
tears
they
simply
spurted
from
her
red
and
swollen
eyes
She
sank
helpless
on
the
first
chair
that
offered
itself
Someone
ran
to
fetch
Kirillovna
Kirillovna
came
was
very
friendly
to
her
but
kept
her
from
seeing
the
mistress
just
as
she
had
Akim
Avdotya
herself
did
not
insist
on
seeing
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
she
had
come
to
her
old
home
simply
because
she
had
nowhere
else
to
go
Kirillovna
ordered
the
samovar
to
be
brought
in
For
a
long
while
Avdotya
refused
to
take
tea
but
yielded
at
last
to
the
entreaties
and
persuasion
of
all
the
maids
and
after
the
first
cup
drank
another
four
When
Kirillovna
saw
that
her
guest
was
a
little
calmer
and
only
shuddered
and
gave
a
faint
sob
from
time
to
time
she
asked
her
where
they
meant
to
move
to
and
what
they
thought
of
doing
with
their
things
Avdotya
began
crying
again
at
this
question
and
protesting
that
she
wanted
nothing
but
to
die
but
Kirillovna
as
a
woman
with
a
head
on
her
shoulders
checked
her
at
once
and
advised
her
without
wasting
time
to
set
to
work
that
very
day
to
move
their
things
to
the
hut
in
the
village
which
had
been
Akim
's
and
in
which
his
uncle
the
old
man
who
had
tried
to
dissuade
him
from
his
marriage
was
now
living
she
told
her
that
with
their
mistress
's
permission
men
and
horses
should
be
sent
to
help
them
in
packing
and
moving
And
as
for
you
my
love
added
Kirillovna
twisting
her
cat-like
lips
into
a
wry
smile
there
will
always
be
a
place
for
you
with
us
and
we
shall
be
delighted
if
you
stay
with
us
till
you
are
settled
in
a
house
of
your
own
again
The
great
thing
is
not
to
lose
heart
The
Lord
has
given
the
Lord
has
taken
away
and
will
give
again
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
of
course
had
to
sell
your
inn
for
reasons
of
her
own
but
she
will
not
forget
you
and
will
make
up
to
you
for
it
she
told
me
to
tell
Akim
Semyonitch
so
Where
is
he
now
Avdotya
answered
that
when
he
met
her
he
had
been
very
unkind
to
her
and
had
driven
off
to
Yefrem
's
Oh
to
that
fellow
's
Kirillovna
replied
significantly
Of
course
I
understand
that
it
's
hard
for
him
now
I
daresay
you
wo
n't
find
him
to-day
what
's
to
be
done
I
must
make
arrangements
Malashka
she
added
turning
to
one
of
the
maids
ask
Nikanop
Ilyitch
to
come
here
we
will
talk
it
over
with
him
Nikanop
Ilyitch
a
feeble-looking
man
who
was
bailiff
or
something
of
the
sort
made
his
appearance
at
once
listened
with
servility
to
all
that
Kirillovna
said
to
him
said
it
shall
be
done
went
out
and
gave
orders
Avdotya
was
given
three
waggons
and
three
peasants
a
fourth
who
said
that
he
was
more
competent
than
they
were
volunteered
to
join
them
and
she
went
with
them
to
the
inn
where
she
found
her
own
labourers
and
the
servant
Fetinya
in
a
state
of
great
confusion
and
alarm
Naum
's
newly
hired
labourers
three
very
stalwart
young
men
had
come
in
the
morning
and
had
not
left
the
place
since
They
were
keeping
very
zealous
guard
as
Naum
had
said
they
would
so
zealous
that
the
iron
tyres
of
a
new
cart
were
suddenly
found
to
be
missing
It
was
a
bitter
bitter
task
for
poor
Avdotya
to
pack
In
spite
of
the
help
of
the
competent
man
who
turned
out
however
only
capable
of
walking
about
with
a
stick
in
his
hand
looking
at
the
others
and
spitting
on
the
ground
she
was
not
able
to
get
it
finished
that
day
and
stayed
the
night
at
the
inn
begging
Fetinya
to
spend
the
night
in
her
room
But
she
only
fell
into
a
feverish
doze
towards
morning
and
the
tears
trickled
down
her
cheeks
even
in
her
sleep
Meanwhile
Yefrem
woke
up
earlier
than
usual
in
his
lumber
room
and
began
knocking
and
asking
to
be
let
out
At
first
his
wife
was
unwilling
to
release
him
and
told
him
through
the
door
that
he
had
not
yet
slept
long
enough
but
he
aroused
her
curiosity
by
promising
to
tell
her
of
the
extraordinary
thing
that
had
happened
to
Akim
she
unbolted
the
door
Yefrem
told
her
what
he
knew
and
ended
by
asking
Is
he
awake
yet
or
not
The
Lord
only
knows
answered
his
wife
Go
and
look
yourself
he
has
n't
got
down
from
the
stove
yet
How
drunk
you
both
were
yesterday
You
should
look
at
your
face
you
do
n't
look
like
yourself
You
are
as
black
as
a
sweep
and
your
hair
is
full
of
hay
That
does
n't
matter
answered
Yefrem
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
head
he
went
into
the
room
Akim
was
no
longer
asleep
he
was
sitting
on
the
stove
with
his
legs
hanging
down
he
too
looked
strange
and
unkempt
His
face
showed
the
effects
the
more
as
he
was
not
used
to
drinking
much
Well
how
have
you
slept
Akim
Semyonitch
Yefrem
began
Akim
looked
at
him
with
lustreless
eyes
Well
brother
Yefrem
he
said
huskily
could
we
have
some
again
Yefrem
took
a
swift
glance
at
Akim
He
felt
a
slight
tremor
at
that
moment
it
was
a
tremor
such
as
is
felt
by
a
sportsman
when
he
hears
the
yap
of
his
dog
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
from
which
he
had
fancied
all
the
game
had
been
driven
What
more
he
asked
at
last
Yes
more
My
wife
will
see
thought
Yefrem
she
wo
n't
let
me
out
most
likely
All
right
he
pronounced
aloud
have
a
little
patience
He
went
out
and
thanks
to
skilfully
taken
precautions
succeeded
in
bringing
in
unseen
a
big
bottle
under
his
coat
Akim
took
the
bottle
But
Yefrem
did
not
sit
down
with
him
as
he
had
the
day
before
he
was
afraid
of
his
wife
and
informing
Akim
that
he
would
go
and
have
a
look
at
what
was
going
on
at
the
inn
and
would
see
that
his
belongings
were
being
packed
and
not
stolen
at
once
set
off
riding
his
little
horse
which
he
had
neglected
to
feed
but
judging
from
the
bulging
front
of
his
coat
he
had
not
forgotten
his
own
needs
Soon
after
he
had
gone
Akim
was
on
the
stove
again
sleeping
like
the
dead
He
did
not
wake
up
or
at
least
gave
no
sign
of
waking
when
Yefrem
returned
four
hours
later
and
began
shaking
him
and
trying
to
rouse
him
and
muttering
over
him
some
very
muddled
phrases
such
as
that
everything
was
moved
and
gone
and
the
ikons
have
been
taken
out
and
driven
away
and
that
everything
was
over
and
that
everyone
was
looking
for
him
but
that
he
Yefrem
had
given
orders
and
not
allowed
them
and
so
on
But
his
mutterings
did
not
last
long
His
wife
carried
him
off
to
the
lumber
room
again
and
very
indignant
both
with
her
husband
and
with
the
visitor
owing
to
whom
her
husband
had
been
drinking
lay
down
herself
in
the
room
on
the
shelf
under
the
ceiling
But
when
she
woke
up
early
as
her
habit
was
and
glanced
at
the
stove
Akim
was
not
there
The
second
cock
had
not
crowed
and
the
night
was
still
so
dark
that
the
sky
hardly
showed
grey
overhead
and
at
the
horizon
melted
into
the
darkness
when
Akim
walked
out
of
the
gate
of
the
sacristan
's
house
His
face
was
pale
but
he
looked
keenly
around
him
and
his
step
was
not
that
of
a
drunken
man
He
walked
in
the
direction
of
his
former
dwelling
the
inn
which
had
now
completely
passed
into
the
possession
of
its
new
owner
Naum
Naum
too
was
awake
when
Akim
stole
out
of
Yefrem
's
house
He
was
not
asleep
he
was
lying
on
a
bench
with
his
sheepskin
coat
under
him
It
was
not
that
his
conscience
was
troubling
him
no
he
had
with
amazing
coolness
been
present
all
day
at
the
packing
and
moving
of
all
Akim's
possessions
and
had
more
than
once
addressed
Avdotya
who
was
so
downcast
that
she
did
not
even
reproach
him
his
conscience
was
at
rest
but
he
was
disturbed
by
various
conjectures
and
calculations
He
did
not
know
whether
he
would
be
lucky
in
his
new
career
he
had
never
before
kept
an
inn
nor
had
a
home
of
his
own
at
all
he
could
not
sleep
The
thing
has
begun
well
he
thought
how
will
it
go
on
Towards
evening
after
seeing
off
the
last
cart
with
Akim's
belongings
Avdotya
walked
behind
it
weeping
he
looked
all
over
the
yard
the
cellars
sheds
and
barns
clambered
up
into
the
loft
more
than
once
instructed
his
labourers
to
keep
a
very
very
sharp
look-out
and
when
he
was
left
alone
after
supper
could
not
go
to
sleep
It
so
happened
that
day
that
no
visitor
stayed
at
the
inn
for
the
night
this
was
a
great
relief
to
him
I
must
certainly
buy
a
dog
from
the
miller
to-morrow
as
fierce
a
one
as
I
can
get
they
've
taken
theirs
away
he
said
to
himself
as
he
tossed
from
side
to
side
and
all
at
once
he
raised
his
head
quickly
he
fancied
that
someone
had
passed
by
the
window
he
listened
there
was
nothing
Only
a
cricket
from
time
to
time
gave
a
cautious
churr
and
a
mouse
was
scratching
somewhere
he
could
hear
his
own
breathing
Everything
was
still
in
the
empty
room
dimly
lighted
by
the
little
glass
lamp
which
he
had
managed
to
hang
up
and
light
before
the
ikon
in
the
corner
He
let
his
head
sink
again
he
thought
he
heard
the
gate
creak
then
a
faint
snapping
sound
from
the
fence
He
could
not
refrain
from
jumping
up
he
opened
the
door
of
the
room
and
in
a
low
voice
called
Fyodor
Fyodor
No
one
answered
He
went
out
into
the
passage
and
almost
fell
over
Fyodor
who
was
lying
on
the
floor
The
man
stirred
in
his
sleep
with
a
faint
grunt
Naum
roused
him
What
's
there
What
do
you
want
Fyodor
began
What
are
you
bawling
for
hold
your
tongue
Naum
articulated
in
a
whisper
How
you
sleep
you
damned
fellows
Have
you
heard
nothing
Nothing
answered
the
man
What
is
it
Where
are
the
others
sleeping
Where
they
were
told
to
sleep
Why
is
there
anything
Hold
your
tongue
come
with
me
Naum
stealthily
opened
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
yard
It
was
very
dark
outside
The
roofed-in
parts
and
the
posts
could
only
be
distinguished
because
they
were
a
still
deeper
black
in
the
midst
of
the
black
darkness
Should
n't
we
light
a
lantern
said
Fyodor
in
a
low
voice
But
Naum
waved
his
hand
and
held
his
breath
At
first
he
could
hear
nothing
but
those
nocturnal
sounds
which
can
almost
always
be
heard
in
an
inhabited
place
a
horse
was
munching
oats
a
pig
grunted
faintly
in
its
sleep
a
man
was
snoring
somewhere
but
all
at
once
his
ear
detected
a
suspicious
sound
coming
from
the
very
end
of
the
yard
near
the
fence
Someone
seemed
to
be
stirring
there
and
breathing
or
blowing
Naum
looked
over
his
shoulder
towards
Fyodor
and
cautiously
descending
the
steps
went
towards
the
sound
Once
or
twice
he
stopped
listened
and
stole
on
further
Suddenly
he
started
Ten
paces
from
him
in
the
thick
darkness
there
came
the
flash
of
a
bright
light
it
was
a
glowing
ember
and
close
to
it
there
was
visible
for
an
instant
the
front
part
of
a
face
with
lips
thrust
out
Quickly
and
silently
like
a
cat
at
a
mouse
Naum
darted
to
the
fire
Hurriedly
rising
up
from
the
ground
a
long
body
rushed
to
meet
him
and
nearly
knocking
him
off
his
feet
almost
eluded
his
grasp
but
Naum
hung
on
to
it
with
all
his
strength
Fyodor
Andrey
Petrushka
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
Make
haste
here
here
I
've
caught
a
thief
trying
to
set
fire
to
the
place
The
man
whom
he
had
caught
fought
and
struggled
violently
but
Naum
did
not
let
him
go
Fyodor
at
once
ran
to
his
assistance
A
lantern
Make
haste
a
lantern
Run
for
a
lantern
wake
the
others
Naum
shouted
to
him
I
can
manage
him
alone
for
a
time
I
am
sitting
on
him
Make
haste
And
bring
a
belt
to
tie
his
hands
Fyodor
ran
into
the
house
The
man
whom
Naum
was
holding
suddenly
left
off
struggling
So
it
seems
wife
and
money
and
home
are
not
enough
for
you
you
want
to
ruin
me
too
he
said
in
a
choking
voice
Naum
recognised
Akim
's
voice
So
that
's
you
my
friend
he
brought
out
very
good
you
wait
a
bit
Let
me
go
said
Akim
are
n't
you
satisfied
I
'll
show
you
before
the
judge
to-morrow
whether
I
am
satisfied
and
Naum
tightened
his
grip
of
Akim
The
labourers
ran
up
with
two
lanterns
and
cords
Tie
his
arms
Naum
ordered
sharply
The
men
caught
hold
of
Akim
stood
him
up
and
twisted
his
arms
behind
his
back
One
of
them
began
abusing
him
but
recognising
the
former
owner
of
the
inn
lapsed
into
silence
and
only
exchanged
glances
with
the
others
Do
you
see
do
you
see
Naum
kept
repeating
meanwhile
throwing
the
light
of
the
lantern
on
the
ground
there
are
hot
embers
in
the
pot
look
there
's
a
regular
log
alight
here
We
must
find
out
where
he
got
this
pot
here
he
has
broken
up
twigs
too
and
Naum
carefully
stamped
out
the
fire
with
his
foot
Search
him
Fyodor
he
added
see
if
he
has
n't
got
something
else
on
him
Fyodor
rummaged
Akim
's
pockets
and
felt
him
all
over
while
the
old
man
stood
motionless
with
his
head
drooping
on
his
breast
as
though
he
were
dead
Here
's
a
knife
said
Fyodor
taking
an
old
kitchen
knife
out
of
the
front
of
Akim
's
coat
Aha
my
fine
gentleman
so
that
's
what
you
were
after
cried
Naum
Lads
you
are
witnesses
here
he
wanted
to
murder
me
and
set
fire
to
the
house
Lock
him
up
for
the
night
in
the
cellar
he
ca
n't
get
out
of
that
I
'll
keep
watch
all
night
myself
and
to-morrow
as
soon
as
it
is
light
we
will
take
him
to
the
police
captain
and
you
are
witnesses
do
you
hear
Akim
was
thrust
into
the
cellar
and
the
door
was
slammed
Naum
set
two
men
to
watch
it
and
did
not
go
to
bed
himself
Meanwhile
Yefrem
's
wife
having
convinced
herself
that
her
uninvited
guest
had
gone
set
about
her
cooking
though
it
was
hardly
daylight
It
was
a
holiday
She
squatted
down
before
the
stove
to
get
a
hot
ember
and
saw
that
someone
had
scraped
out
the
hot
ashes
before
her
then
she
wanted
her
knife
and
searched
for
it
in
vain
then
of
her
four
cooking
pots
one
was
missing
Yefrem
's
wife
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
woman
with
brains
and
justly
so
She
stood
and
pondered
then
went
to
the
lumber
room
to
her
husband
It
was
not
easy
to
wake
him
and
still
more
difficult
to
explain
to
him
why
he
was
being
awakened
To
all
that
she
said
to
him
Yefrem
made
the
same
answer
He
's
gone
away
well
God
bless
him
What
business
is
it
of
mine
He
's
taken
our
knife
and
our
pot
well
God
bless
him
what
has
it
to
do
with
me
At
last
however
he
got
up
and
after
listening
attentively
to
his
wife
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
bad
business
that
something
must
be
done
Yes
his
wife
repeated
it
is
a
bad
business
maybe
he
will
be
doing
mischief
in
his
despair
I
saw
last
night
that
he
was
not
asleep
but
was
just
lying
on
the
stove
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
go
and
see
Yefrem
Alexandritch
I
tell
you
what
Ulyana
Fyodorovna
Yefrem
began
I
'll
go
myself
to
the
inn
now
and
you
be
so
kind
mother
as
to
give
me
just
a
drop
to
sober
me
Ulyana
hesitated
Well
she
decided
at
last
I
'll
give
you
the
vodka
Yefrem
Alexandritch
but
mind
now
none
of
your
pranks
Do
n't
you
worry
Ulyana
Fyodorovna
And
fortifying
himself
with
a
glass
Yefrem
made
his
way
to
the
inn
It
was
only
just
getting
light
when
he
rode
up
to
the
inn
but
already
a
cart
and
a
horse
were
standing
at
the
gate
and
one
of
Naum's
labourers
was
sitting
on
the
box
holding
the
reins
Where
are
you
off
to
asked
Yefrem
To
the
town
the
man
answered
reluctantly
What
for
The
man
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
did
not
answer
Yefrem
jumped
off
his
horse
and
went
into
the
house
In
the
entry
he
came
upon
Naum
fully
dressed
and
with
his
cap
on
I
congratulate
the
new
owner
on
his
new
abode
said
Yefrem
who
knew
him
Where
are
you
off
to
so
early
Yes
you
have
something
to
congratulate
me
on
Naum
answered
grimly
On
the
very
first
day
the
house
has
almost
been
burnt
down
Yefrem
started
How
so
Oh
a
kind
soul
turned
up
who
tried
to
set
fire
to
it
Luckily
I
caught
him
in
the
act
now
I
am
taking
him
to
the
town
Was
it
Akim
I
wonder
Yefrem
asked
slowly
How
did
you
know
Akim
He
came
at
night
with
a
burning
log
in
a
pot
and
got
into
the
yard
and
was
setting
fire
to
it
all
my
men
are
witnesses
Would
you
like
to
see
him
It
's
time
for
us
to
take
him
by
the
way
My
good
Naum
Ivanitch
Yefrem
began
let
him
go
do
n't
ruin
the
old
man
altogether
Do
n't
take
that
sin
upon
your
soul
Naum
Ivanitch
Only
think
the
man
was
in
despair
he
did
n't
know
what
he
was
doing
Give
over
that
nonsense
Naum
cut
him
short
What
Am
I
likely
to
let
him
go
Why
he
'd
set
fire
to
the
house
to-morrow
if
I
did
He
would
n't
Naum
Ivanitch
believe
me
Believe
me
you
will
be
easier
yourself
for
it
you
know
there
will
be
questions
asked
a
trial
you
can
see
that
for
yourself
Well
what
if
there
is
a
trial
I
have
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
it
My
good
Naum
Ivanitch
one
must
be
afraid
of
a
trial
Oh
that
's
enough
I
see
you
are
drunk
already
and
to-day
a
saint's
day
too
Yefrem
all
at
once
quite
unexpectedly
burst
into
tears
I
am
drunk
but
I
am
speaking
the
truth
he
muttered
And
for
the
sake
of
the
holiday
you
ought
to
forgive
him
Well
come
along
you
sniveller
And
Naum
went
out
on
to
the
steps
Forgive
him
for
Avdotya
Arefyevna
's
sake
said
Yefrem
following
him
on
to
the
steps
Naum
went
to
the
cellar
and
flung
the
door
wide
open
With
timid
curiosity
Yefrem
craned
his
neck
from
behind
Naum
and
with
difficulty
made
out
the
figure
of
Akim
in
the
corner
of
the
cellar
The
once
well-to-do
innkeeper
respected
all
over
the
neighbourhood
was
sitting
on
straw
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
like
a
criminal
Hearing
a
noise
he
raised
his
head
It
seemed
as
though
he
had
grown
fearfully
thin
in
those
last
few
days
especially
during
the
previous
night
his
sunken
eyes
could
hardly
be
seen
under
his
high
waxen-yellow
forehead
his
parched
lips
looked
dark
his
whole
face
was
changed
and
wore
a
strange
expression
savage
and
frightened
Get
up
and
come
along
said
Naum
Akim
got
up
and
stepped
over
the
threshold
Akim
Semyonitch
Yefrem
wailed
you
've
brought
ruin
on
yourself
my
dear
Akim
glanced
at
him
without
speaking
If
I
had
known
why
you
asked
for
vodka
I
would
not
have
given
it
to
you
I
really
would
not
I
believe
I
would
have
drunk
it
all
myself
Eh
Naum
Ivanitch
he
added
clutching
at
Naum
's
arm
have
mercy
upon
him
let
him
go
What
next
Naum
replied
with
a
grin
Well
come
along
he
added
addressing
Akim
again
What
are
you
waiting
for
Naum
Ivanitch
Akim
began
What
is
it
Naum
Ivanitch
Akim
repeated
listen
I
am
to
blame
I
wanted
to
settle
my
accounts
with
you
myself
but
God
must
be
the
judge
between
us
You
have
taken
everything
from
me
you
know
yourself
everything
I
had
Now
you
can
ruin
me
only
I
tell
you
this
if
you
let
me
go
now
then
so
be
it
take
possession
of
everything
I
agree
and
wish
you
all
success
I
promise
you
as
before
God
if
you
let
me
go
you
will
not
regret
it
God
be
with
you
Akim
shut
his
eyes
and
ceased
speaking
A
likely
story
retorted
Naum
as
though
one
could
believe
you
But
by
God
you
can
said
Yefrem
you
really
can
I
'd
stake
my
life
on
Akim
Semyonitch
's
good
faith
I
really
would
Nonsense
cried
Naum
Come
along
Akim
looked
at
him
As
you
think
best
Naum
Ivanitch
It
's
for
you
to
decide
But
you
are
laying
a
great
burden
on
your
soul
Well
if
you
are
in
such
a
hurry
let
us
start
Naum
in
his
turn
looked
keenly
at
Akim
After
all
he
thought
to
himself
had
n't
I
better
let
him
go
Or
people
will
never
have
done
pestering
me
about
him
Avdotya
will
give
me
no
peace
While
Naum
was
reflecting
no
one
uttered
a
word
The
labourer
in
the
cart
who
could
see
it
all
through
the
gate
did
nothing
but
toss
his
head
and
flick
the
horse
's
sides
with
the
reins
The
two
other
labourers
stood
on
the
steps
and
they
too
were
silent
Well
listen
old
man
Naum
began
when
I
let
you
go
and
tell
these
fellows
he
motioned
with
his
head
towards
the
labourers
not
to
talk
shall
we
be
quits
do
you
understand
me
quits
eh
I
tell
you
you
can
have
it
all
You
wo
n't
consider
me
in
your
debt
You
wo
n't
be
in
my
debt
I
shall
not
be
in
yours
Naum
was
silent
again
And
will
you
swear
it
Yes
as
God
is
holy
answered
Akim
Well
I
know
I
shall
regret
it
said
Naum
but
there
come
what
may
Give
me
your
hands
Akim
turned
his
back
to
him
Naum
began
untying
him
Now
mind
old
man
he
added
as
he
pulled
the
cord
off
his
wrists
remember
I
have
spared
you
mind
that
Naum
Ivanitch
my
dear
faltered
Yefrem
the
Lord
will
have
mercy
upon
you
Akim
freed
his
chilled
and
swollen
hands
and
was
moving
towards
the
gate
Naum
suddenly
showed
the
Jew
as
the
saying
is
he
must
have
regretted
that
he
had
let
Akim
off
You
've
sworn
now
mind
he
shouted
after
him
Akim
turned
