INTRODUCTION
An
examination
of
A
Lear
of
the
Steppes
is
of
especial
interest
to
authors
as
the
story
is
so
exquisite
in
its
structure
so
overwhelming
in
its
effects
that
it
exposes
the
artificiality
of
the
great
majority
of
the
clever
works
of
art
in
fiction
A
Lear
of
the
Steppes
is
great
in
art
because
it
is
a
living
organic
whole
springing
from
the
deep
roots
of
life
itself
and
the
innumerable
works
of
art
that
are
fabricated
and
pasted
together
from
an
ingenious
plan
works
that
do
not
grow
from
the
inevitability
of
things
appear
at
once
insignificant
or
false
in
comparison
In
examining
the
art
the
artist
will
note
that
Turgenev
s
method
of
introducing
his
story
is
a
lesson
in
sincerity
Harlov
the
Lear
of
the
story
is
brought
forward
with
such
force
on
the
threshold
that
all
eyes
resting
on
his
figure
can
not
but
follow
his
after
movements
And
absolute
conviction
gained
all
the
artist
s
artful
after-devices
and
subtle
presentations
and
side-lights
on
the
story
are
not
apparent
under
the
straightforward
ease
and
the
seeming
carelessness
with
which
the
narrator
describes
his
boyish
memories
Then
Harlov
s
household
his
two
daughters
and
a
crowd
of
minor
characters
are
brought
before
us
as
persons
in
the
tragedy
and
we
see
that
all
these
people
are
living
each
from
the
innate
laws
of
his
being
apparently
independently
of
the
author
s
scheme
This
conviction
that
the
author
has
no
pre-arranged
plan
convinces
us
that
in
the
story
we
are
living
a
piece
of
life
here
we
are
verily
plunging
into
life
itself
And
the
story
goes
on
flowing
easily
and
naturally
till
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
the
peasants
the
woods
and
fields
around
are
known
by
us
as
intimately
as
is
any
neighbourhood
in
life
Suddenly
a
break
the
tragedy
is
upon
us
Suddenly
the
terrific
forces
that
underlie
human
life
even
the
meanest
of
human
lives
burst
on
us
astonished
and
breathless
precisely
as
a
tragedy
comes
up
to
the
surface
and
bursts
on
us
in
real
life
everybody
runs
about
dazed
annoyed
futile
we
watch
the
other
people
sustaining
their
own
individuality
inadequately
in
the
face
of
the
monstrous
new
events
which
go
their
fatal
way
logically
events
which
leave
the
people
huddled
and
useless
and
gasping
And
destruction
having
burst
out
of
life
life
slowly
returns
to
its
old
grooves
with
a
difference
to
us
the
difference
in
the
relation
of
people
one
to
another
that
a
death
or
a
tragedy
always
leaves
to
the
survivors
Marvellous
in
its
truth
is
Turgenev
s
analysis
of
the
situation
after
Harlov
s
death
marvellous
is
the
simple
description
of
the
neighbourhood
s
attitude
to
the
Harlov
family
and
marvellous
is
the
lifting
of
the
scene
on
the
after-life
of
Harlov
s
daughters
In
the
pages
pages

on
these
women
Turgenev
flashes
into
the
reader
s
mind
an
extraordinary
sense
of
the
inevitability
of
these
women
s
natures
of
their
innate
growth
fashioning
their
after-lives
as
logically
as
a
beech
puts
out
beech-leaves
and
an
oak
oak-leaves
Through
Turgenev
s
single
glimpse
at
their
fortunes
one
knows
the
whole
intervening
fifteen
years
he
has
carried
us
into
a
new
world
yet
it
is
the
old
world
one
needs
to
know
no
more
It
is
life
arbitrary
but
inevitable
life
so
clarified
by
art
that
it
is
absolutely
interpreted
but
life
with
all
the
sense
of
mystery
that
nature
breathes
around
it
in
its
ceaseless
growth
This
sense
of
inevitability
and
of
the
mystery
of
life
which
Turgenev
gives
us
in
A
Lear
of
the
Steppes
is
the
highest
demand
we
can
make
from
art
Acia
the
last
story
in
the
present
volume
though
it
gives
us
a
sense
of
mystery
is
not
inevitable
the
end
is
faked
to
suit
the
artist
s
purpose
and
thus
as
in
other
ways
it
is
far
inferior
to
Lear
Faust
the
second
story
has
consummate
charm
in
its
strange
atmosphere
of
the
supernatural
mingling
with
things
earthly
but
it
is
not
as
is
Lear
life
seen
from
the
surface
to
the
revealed
depths
it
is
a
revelation
of
the
strange
forces
in
life
presented
beautifully
but
it
is
rather
an
idea
a
problem
to
be
worked
out
by
certain
characters
than
a
piece
of
life
inevitable
and
growing
When
an
artist
creates
in
us
the
sense
of
inevitability
then
his
work
is
at
its
highest
and
is
obeying
nature
s
law
of
growth
unfolding
from
out
itself
as
inevitably
as
a
tree
or
a
flower
or
a
human
being
unfolds
from
out
itself
Turgenev
at
his
highest
never
quits
nature
yet
he
always
uses
the
surface
and
what
is
apparent
to
disclose
her
most
secret
principles
her
deepest
potentialities
her
inmost
laws
of
being
and
whatever
he
presents
he
presents
clearly
and
simply
This
combination
of
powers
marks
only
the
few
supreme
artists
Even
great
masters
often
fail
in
perfect
naturalness
Tolstoi
s
The
Death
of
Ivan
Ilytch
for
example
one
of
the
most
powerful
stories
ever
written
has
too
little
that
is
typical
of
the
whole
of
life
too
much
that
is
strained
towards
the
general
purpose
of
the
story
to
be
really
natural
Turgenev
s
special
feat
in
fiction
is
that
his
characters
reveal
themselves
by
the
most
ordinary
details
of
their
every-day
life
and
while
these
details
are
always
giving
us
the
whole
life
of
the
people
and
their
inner
life
as
well
the
novel
s
significance
is
being
built
up
simply
out
of
these
details
built
up
by
the
same
process
in
fact
as
nature
creates
for
us
a
single
strong
impression
out
of
a
multitude
of
little
details
The
Impressionists
it
is
true
often
give
us
amazingly
clever
pictures
of
life
seen
subtly
and
drawn
naturally
but
in
general
their
able
pictures
of
the
way
men
think
and
act
do
not
reveal
more
than
the
actual
thinking
and
acting
that
men
betray
to
one
another
they
do
not
betray
the
whole
significance
of
their
lives
more
than
does
the
daily
life
itself
And
so
the
Impressionists
give
pictures
of
life
s
surface
and
not
interpretations
of
its
eternal
depths
they
pass
away
as
portraits
of
the
time
amazingly
felicitous
artistic
portraits
But
Turgenev
s
power
as
a
poet
comes
in
whenever
he
draws
a
commonplace
figure
to
make
it
bring
with
it
a
sense
of
the
mystery
of
its
existence
In
Lear
the
steward
Kvitsinsky
plays
a
subsidiary
part
he
has
apparently
no
significance
in
the
story
and
very
little
is
told
about
him
But
who
does
not
perceive
that
Turgenev
looks
at
and
presents
the
figure
of
this
man
in
a
manner
totally
different
from
the
way
any
clever
novelist
of
the
second
rank
would
look
at
and
use
him
Kvitsinsky
in
Turgenev
s
hands
is
an
individual
with
all
the
individual
s
mystery
in
his
glance
his
coming
and
going
his
way
of
taking
things
but
he
is
a
part
of
the
household
s
breath
of
its
very
existence
he
breathes
the
atmosphere
naturally
and
creates
an
atmosphere
of
his
own
If
Hugo
had
created
him
he
would
have
been
out
of
focus
immediately
Balzac
would
have
described
the
household
minutely
and
then
let
Kvitsinsky
appear
as
a
separate
entity
in
it
the
Impressionists
would
sketch
him
as
a
living
picture
a
part
of
the
household
but
he
would
remain
as
first
created
he
would
always
repeat
the
first
impression
he
makes
on
us
a
certain
man
in
a
certain
aspect
and
they
would
not
give
us
the
steward
revealing
his
character
imperceptibly
from
day
to
day
in
his
minute
actions
naturally
and
little
by
little
as
this
man
reveals
his
It
is
then
in
his
marvellous
sense
of
the
growth
of
life
that
Turgenev
is
superior
to
most
of
his
rivals
Not
only
did
he
observe
life
minutely
and
comprehensively
but
he
reproduces
it
as
a
constantly
growing
phenomenon
growing
naturally
not
accidentally
or
arbitrarily
For
example
in
A
House
of
Gentlefolk
take
Lavretsky
s
and
Liza
s
changes
of
mood
when
they
are
falling
in
love
one
with
another
it
is
nature
herself
in
them
changing
very
delicately
and
insensibly
we
feel
that
the
whole
picture
is
alive
not
an
effect
cut
out
from
life
and
cut
off
from
it
at
the
same
time
like
a
bunch
of
cut
flowers
an
effect
which
many
clever
novelists
often
give
us
And
in
Lear
we
feel
that
the
life
in
Harlov
s
village
is
still
going
on
growing
yonder
still
growing
with
all
its
mysterious
sameness
and
changes
when
in
Turgenev
s
last
words
The
story-teller
ceased
and
we
talked
a
little
longer
and
then
parted
each
to
his
home
Turgenev
s
sympathy
with
women
and
his
unequalled
power
of
drawing
them
not
merely
as
they
appear
to
men
but
as
they
appear
to
each
other
has
been
dwelt
on
by
many
writers
And
in
truth
of
the
three
leading
qualities
into
which
his
artistic
powers
may
be
arbitrarily
analysed
the
most
apparent
is
precisely
that
delicate
feminine
intuition
and
sensitive
emotional
consciousness
into
all
the
nuances
of
personal
relations
that
women
possess
in
life
and
are
never
able
to
put
into
books
This
fluid
sympathetic
perception
is
instinctive
in
Turgenev
it
is
his
temperament
to
be
sympathetic
or
receptive
to
all
types
except
perhaps
to
purely
masculine
men
of
action
whom
he
never
draws
with
success
His
temperament
is
bathed
in
a
delicate
emotional
atmosphere
quivering
with
light
which
discloses
all
the
infinite
riches
of
the
created
world
the
relation
of
each
character
to
its
particular
universe
and
the
significance
of
its
human
fate
And
this
state
of
soul
or
flow
of
mood
in
Turgenev
is
creative
as
when
music
floats
from
a
distance
to
the
listener
immediately
the
darkening
fields
the
rough
coarse
earth
of
cheap
human
life
with
all
the
grind
and
petty
monotony
of
existence
melt
into
harmony
and
life
is
seen
as
a
mysterious
whole
not
merely
as
a
puzzling
discrepancy
of
gaps
and
contradictions
and
days
of
little
import
This
fluid
emotional
consciousness
of
Turgenev
is
feminine
inasmuch
as
it
is
a
receptive
sympathising
and
harmonising
attitude
but
just
where
the
woman
s
faculty
of
receptiveness
ends
where
her
perception
fails
to
go
beyond
the
facts
she
is
alive
to
Turgenev
s
consciousness
flashes
out
into
the
great
poet
s
creative
world
with
its
immense
breadth
of
vision
force
and
imagination
Thus
in
laying
down
A
Lear
of
the
Steppes
the
reader
is
conscious
that
he
is
seeing
past
the
human
life
of
the
tragedy
on
to
the
limitless
seas
of
existence
beyond
he
is
looking
beyond
the
heads
of
the
moving
human
figures
out
on
to
the
infinite
horizon
Just
where
the
woman
s
interest
would
stop
and
rest
satisfied
with
the
near
personal
elements
in
the
drama
Turgenev
s
constructive
poetic
force
sees
the
universal
and
in
turn
interprets
these
figures
in
relation
to
the
far
wider
field
of
the
race
the
age
and
makes
them
symbolical
of
the
deep
forces
of
all
human
existence
And
thus
Turgenev
becomes
a
creator
originating
a
world
greater
than
he
received
His
creation
of
Bazarov
in
Fathers
and
Children
from
a
three
hours
accidental
meeting
with
a
man
while
on
a
journey
is
an
extraordinary
instance
of
how
unerringly
his
vision
created
in
fore-thought
a
world
that
was
to
come
He
accepted
the
man
he
was
penetrated
with
the
new
and
strange
conceptions
of
life
offered
and
as
a
poet
he
saw
in
a
flash
the
immense
significance
to
society
of
this
man
s
appearance
in
the
age
He
saw
a
new
and
formidable
type
had
arisen
in
the
nation
negating
its
traditions
its
beliefs
its
conceptions
and
from
this
solitary
meeting
with
an
individual
Turgenev
laid
bare
and
predicted
the
progress
of
the
most
formidable
social
and
political
movement
in
modern
Russia
predicted
it
and
set
it
forth
in
art
a
decade
before
its
birth
In
truth
Turgenev
s
art
at
its
highest
may
well
be
the
despair
of
artists
who
have
sufficient
insight
to
understand
wherein
he
excels
He
is
rich
in
all
the
gifts
so
he
penetrates
into
everything
but
it
is
the
perfect
harmony
existing
between
his
gifts
that
makes
him
see
everything
in
proportion
Thus
he
never
caricatures
he
is
never
too
forcible
and
never
too
clever
He
is
a
great
realist
and
his
realism
carries
along
with
it
the
natural
breath
of
poetry
His
art
is
highly
complex
but
its
expression
is
so
pellucid
so
simple
that
we
can
see
only
its
body
never
the
mechanism
of
its
body
His
thought
and
his
emotion
are
blended
in
one
he
interprets
life
but
always
preserves
the
atmosphere
the
glamour
the
mystery
of
the
living
thing
in
his
interpretation
His
creative
world
arises
spontaneously
from
his
own
depths
the
mark
of
the
world
s
great
masters
Never
thinking
of
himself
he
inspires
his
readers
with
a
secret
delight
for
the
beauty
that
he
found
everywhere
in
life
And
he
never
shuts
his
eyes
against
the
true

A
LEAR
OF
THE
STEPPES
We
were
a
party
of
six
gathered
together
one
winter
evening
at
the
house
of
an
old
college
friend
The
conversation
turned
on
Shakespeare
on
his
types
and
how
profoundly
and
truly
they
were
taken
from
the
very
heart
of
humanity
We
admired
particularly
their
truth
to
life
their
actuality
Each
of
us
spoke
of
the
Hamlets
the
Othellos
the
Falstaffs
even
the
Richard
the
Thirds
and
Macbeths
the
two
last
only
potentially
it
is
true
resembling
their
prototypes
whom
he
had
happened
to
come
across
And
I
gentlemen
cried
our
host
a
man
well
past
middle
age
used
to
know
a
King
Lear
How
was
that
we
questioned
him
Oh
would
you
like
me
to
tell
you
about
him
Please
do
And
our
friend
promptly
began
his
narrative
All
my
childhood
he
began
and
early
youth
up
to
the
age
of
fifteen
I
spent
in
the
country
on
the
estate
of
my
mother
a
wealthy
landowner
in
X
province
Almost
the
most
vivid
impression
that
has
remained
in
my
memory
of
that
far-off
time
is
the
figure
of
our
nearest
neighbour
Martin
Petrovitch
Harlov
Indeed
it
would
be
difficult
for
such
an
impression
to
be
obliterated
I
never
in
my
life
afterwards
met
anything
in
the
least
like
Harlov
Picture
to
yourselves
a
man
of
gigantic
stature
On
his
huge
carcase
was
set
a
little
askew
and
without
the
least
trace
of
a
neck
a
prodigious
head
A
perfect
haystack
of
tangled
yellowish-grey
hair
stood
up
all
over
it
growing
almost
down
to
the
bushy
eyebrows
On
the
broad
expanse
of
his
purple
face
that
looked
as
though
it
had
been
peeled
there
protruded
a
sturdy
knobby
nose
diminutive
little
blue
eyes
stared
out
haughtily
and
a
mouth
gaped
open
that
was
diminutive
too
but
crooked
chapped
and
of
the
same
colour
as
the
rest
of
the
face
The
voice
that
proceeded
from
this
mouth
though
hoarse
was
exceedingly
strong
and
resonant
Its
sound
recalled
the
clank
of
iron
bars
carried
in
a
cart
over
a
badly
paved
road
and
when
Harlov
spoke
it
was
as
though
some
one
were
shouting
in
a
high
wind
across
a
wide
ravine
It
was
difficult
to
tell
just
what
Harlov
s
face
expressed
it
was
such
an
expanse
One
felt
one
could
hardly
take
it
all
in
at
one
glance
But
it
was
not
disagreeable
a
certain
grandeur
indeed
could
be
discerned
in
it
only
it
was
exceedingly
astounding
and
unusual
And
what
hands
he
had
positive
cushions
What
fingers
what
feet
I
remember
I
could
never
gaze
without
a
certain
respectful
awe
at
the
four-foot
span
of
Martin
Petrovitch
s
back
at
his
shoulders
like
millstones
But
what
especially
struck
me
was
his
ears
They
were
just
like
great
twists
of
bread
full
of
bends
and
curves
his
cheeks
seemed
to
support
them
on
both
sides
Martin
Petrovitch
used
to
wear
winter
and
summer
alike
a
Cossack
dress
of
green
cloth
girt
about
with
a
small
Tcherkess
strap
and
tarred
boots
I
never
saw
a
cravat
on
him
and
indeed
what
could
he
have
tied
a
cravat
round
He
breathed
slowly
and
heavily
like
a
bull
but
walked
without
a
sound
One
might
have
imagined
that
having
got
into
a
room
he
was
in
constant
fear
of
upsetting
and
overturning
everything
and
so
moved
cautiously
from
place
to
place
sideways
for
the
most
part
as
though
slinking
by
He
was
possessed
of
a
strength
truly
Herculean
and
in
consequence
enjoyed
great
renown
in
the
neighbourhood
Our
common
people
retain
to
this
day
their
reverence
for
Titanic
heroes
Legends
were
invented
about
him
They
used
to
recount
that
he
had
one
day
met
a
bear
in
the
forest
and
had
almost
vanquished
him
that
having
once
caught
a
thief
in
his
beehouse
he
had
flung
him
horse
and
cart
and
all
over
the
hedge
and
so
on
Harlov
himself
never
boasted
of
his
strength
If
my
right
hand
is
blessed
he
used
to
say
so
it
is
God
s
will
it
should
be
He
was
proud
only
he
did
not
take
pride
in
his
strength
but
in
his
rank
his
descent
his
common
sense
Our
family
s
descended
from
the
Swede
Harlus
he
used
to
maintain
In
the
princely
reign
of
Ivan
Vassilievitch
the
Dark
fancy
how
long
ago
he
came
to
Russia
and
that
Swede
Harlus
did
not
wish
to
be
a
Finnish
count
but
he
wished
to
be
a
Russian
nobleman
and
he
was
inscribed
in
the
golden
book
It
s
from
him
we
Harlovs
are
sprung
And
by
the
same
token
all
of
us
Harlovs
are
born
flaxen-haired
with
light
eyes
and
clean
faces
because
we
re
children
of
the
snow
But
Martin
Petrovitch
I
once
tried
to
object
there
never
was
an
Ivan
Vassilievitch
the
Dark
Then
was
an
Ivan
Vassilievitch
the
Terrible
The
Dark
was
the
name
given
to
the
great
prince
Vassily
Vassilievitch
What
nonsense
will
you
talk
next
Harlov
answered
serenely
since
I
say
so
so
it
was
One
day
my
mother
took
it
into
her
head
to
commend
him
to
his
face
for
his
really
remarkable
incorruptibility
Ah
Natalia
Nikolaevna
he
protested
almost
angrily
what
a
thing
to
praise
me
for
really
We
gentlefolk
can
t
be
otherwise
so
that
no
churl
no
low-born
servile
creature
dare
even
imagine
evil
of
us
I
am
a
Harlov
my
family
has
come
down
from
here
he
pointed
up
somewhere
very
high
aloft
in
the
ceiling
and
me
not
be
honest
How
is
it
possible
Another
time
a
high
official
who
had
come
into
the
neighbourhood
and
was
staying
with
my
mother
fancied
he
could
make
fun
of
Martin
Petrovitch
The
latter
had
again
referred
to
the
Swede
Harlus
who
came
to
Russia
In
the
days
of
King
Solomon
the
official
interrupted
No
not
of
King
Solomon
but
of
the
great
Prince
Ivan
Vassilievitch
the
Dark
But
I
imagine
the
official
pursued
that
your
family
is
much
more
ancient
and
goes
back
to
antediluvian
days
when
there
were
still
mastodons
and
megatheriums
about
These
scientific
names
were
absolutely
meaningless
to
Martin
Petrovitch
but
he
realised
that
the
dignitary
was
laughing
at
him
May
be
so
he
boomed
our
family
is
no
doubt
very
ancient
in
those
days
when
my
ancestor
was
in
Moscow
they
do
say
there
was
as
great
a
fool
as
your
excellency
living
there
and
such
fools
are
not
seen
twice
in
a
thousand
years
The
high
official
was
in
a
furious
rage
while
Harlov
threw
his
head
back
stuck
out
his
chin
snorted
and
disappeared
Two
days
later
he
came
in
again
My
mother
began
reproaching
him
It
s
a
lesson
for
him
ma
am
interposed
Harlov
not
to
fly
off
without
knowing
what
he
s
about
to
find
out
whom
he
has
to
deal
with
first
He
s
young
yet
he
must
be
taught
The
dignitary
was
almost
of
the
same
age
as
Harlov
but
this
Titan
was
in
the
habit
of
regarding
every
one
as
not
fully
grown
up
He
had
the
greatest
confidence
in
himself
and
was
afraid
of
absolutely
no
one
Can
they
do
anything
to
me
Where
on
earth
is
the
man
that
can
he
would
ask
and
suddenly
he
would
go
off
into
a
short
but
deafening
guffaw
My
mother
was
exceedingly
particular
in
her
choice
of
acquaintances
but
she
made
Harlov
welcome
with
special
cordiality
and
allowed
him
many
privileges
Twenty-five
years
before
he
had
saved
her
life
by
holding
up
her
carriage
on
the
edge
of
a
deep
precipice
down
which
the
horses
had
already
fallen
The
traces
and
straps
of
the
harness
broke
but
Martin
Petrovitch
did
not
let
go
his
hold
of
the
wheel
he
had
grasped
though
the
blood
spurted
out
under
his
nails
My
mother
had
arranged
his
marriage
She
chose
for
his
wife
an
orphan
girl
of
seventeen
who
had
been
brought
up
in
her
house
he
was
over
forty
at
the
time
Martin
Petrovitch
s
wife
was
a
frail
creature
they
said
he
carried
her
into
his
house
in
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
she
did
not
live
long
with
him
She
bore
him
two
daughters
however
After
her
death
my
mother
continued
her
good
offices
to
Martin
Petrovitch
She
placed
his
elder
daughter
in
the
district
school
and
afterwards
found
her
a
husband
and
already
had
another
in
her
eye
for
the
second
Harlov
was
a
fairly
good
manager
He
had
a
little
estate
of
nearly
eight
hundred
acres
and
had
built
on
to
his
place
a
little
and
the
way
the
peasants
obeyed
him
is
indescribable
Owing
to
his
stoutness
Harlov
scarcely
ever
went
anywhere
on
foot
the
earth
did
not
bear
him
He
used
to
go
everywhere
in
a
low
racing
droshky
himself
driving
a
rawboned
mare
thirty
years
old
with
a
scar
on
her
shoulder
from
a
wound
which
she
had
received
in
the
battle
of
Borodino
under
the
quartermaster
of
a
cavalry
regiment
This
mare
was
always
somehow
lame
in
all
four
legs
she
could
not
go
at
a
walking
pace
but
could
only
change
from
a
trot
to
a
canter
She
used
to
eat
mugwort
and
wormwood
along
the
hedges
which
I
have
never
noticed
any
other
horse
do
I
remember
I
always
used
to
wonder
how
such
a
broken-down
nag
could
draw
such
a
fearful
weight
I
won
t
venture
to
repeat
how
many
hundred-weight
were
attributed
to
our
neighbour
In
the
droshky
behind
Martin
Petrovitch
s
back
perched
his
swarthy
page
Maximka
With
his
face
and
whole
person
squeezed
close
up
to
his
master
and
his
bare
feet
propped
on
the
hind
axle
bar
of
the
droshky
he
looked
like
a
little
leaf
or
worm
which
had
clung
by
chance
to
the
gigantic
carcase
before
him
This
same
page
boy
used
once
a
week
to
shave
Martin
Petrovitch
He
used
so
they
said
to
stand
on
a
table
to
perform
this
operation
Some
jocose
persons
averred
that
he
had
to
run
round
his
master
s
chin
Harlov
did
not
like
staying
long
at
home
and
so
one
might
often
see
him
driving
about
in
his
invariable
equipage
with
the
reins
in
one
hand
the
other
he
held
smartly
on
his
knee
with
the
elbow
crooked
upwards
with
a
diminutive
old
cap
on
the
very
top
of
his
head
He
looked
boldly
about
him
with
his
little
bear-like
eyes
shouted
in
a
voice
of
thunder
to
all
the
peasants
artisans
and
tradespeople
he
met
Priests
he
greatly
disliked
and
he
would
send
vigorous
abjurations
after
them
when
he
met
them
One
day
on
overtaking
me
I
was
out
for
a
stroll
with
my
gun
he
hallooed
at
a
hare
that
lay
near
the
road
in
such
a
way
that
I
could
not
get
the
roar
and
ring
of
it
out
of
my
ears
all
day
My
mother
as
I
have
already
stated
made
Martin
Petrovitch
very
welcome
She
knew
what
a
profound
respect
he
entertained
for
her
person
She
is
a
real
gentlewoman
one
of
our
sort
was
the
way
he
used
to
refer
to
her
He
used
to
style
her
his
benefactress
while
she
saw
in
him
a
devoted
giant
who
would
not
have
hesitated
to
face
a
whole
mob
of
peasants
in
defence
of
her
and
although
no
one
foresaw
the
barest
possibility
of
such
a
contingency
still
to
my
mother
s
notions
in
the
absence
of
a
husband
she
had
early
been
left
a
widow
such
a
champion
as
Martin
Petrovitch
was
not
to
be
despised
And
besides
he
was
a
man
of
upright
character
who
curried
favour
with
no
one
never
borrowed
money
or
drank
spirits
and
no
fool
either
though
he
had
received
no
sort
of
education
My
mother
trusted
Martin
Petrovitch
when
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
make
her
will
she
asked
him
to
witness
it
and
he
drove
home
expressly
to
fetch
his
round
iron-rimmed
spectacles
without
which
he
could
not
write
And
with
spectacles
on
nose
he
succeeded
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
many
gasps
and
groans
and
great
effort
in
inscribing
his
Christian
name
father
s
name
and
surname
and
his
rank
and
designation
tracing
enormous
quadrangular
letters
with
tails
and
flourishes
Having
completed
this
task
he
declared
he
was
tired
out
and
that
writing
for
him
was
as
hard
work
as
catching
fleas
Yes
my
mother
had
a
respect
for
him
he
was
not
however
admitted
beyond
the
dining-room
in
our
house
He
carried
a
very
strong
odour
about
with
him
there
was
a
smell
of
the
earth
of
decaying
forest
of
marsh
mud
about
him
He
s
a
forest-demon
my
old
nurse
would
declare
At
dinner
a
special
table
used
to
be
laid
apart
in
a
corner
for
Martin
Petrovitch
and
he
was
not
offended
at
that
he
knew
other
people
were
ill
at
ease
sitting
beside
him
and
he
too
had
greater
freedom
in
eating
And
he
did
eat
too
as
no
one
I
imagine
has
eaten
since
the
days
of
Polyphemus
At
the
very
beginning
of
dinner
by
way
of
a
precautionary
measure
they
always
served
him
a
pot
of
some
four
pounds
of
porridge
else
you
d
eat
me
out
of
house
and
home
my
mother
used
to
say
That
I
should
ma
am
Martin
Petrovitch
would
respond
grinning
My
mother
liked
to
hear
his
reflections
on
any
topic
connected
with
the
land
But
she
could
not
support
the
sound
of
his
voice
for
long
together
What
s
the
meaning
of
it
my
good
sir
she
would
exclaim
you
might
take
something
to
cure
yourself
of
it
really
You
simply
deafen
me
Such
a
trumpet-blast
Natalia
Nikolaevna
benefactress
Martin
Petrovitch
would
rejoin
as
a
rule
I
m
not
responsible
for
my
throat
And
what
medicine
could
have
any
effect
on
me
kindly
tell
me
that
I
d
better
hold
my
tongue
for
a
bit
In
reality
I
imagine
no
medicine
could
have
affected
Martin
Petrovitch
He
was
never
ill
He
was
not
good
at
telling
stories
and
did
not
care
for
it
Much
talking
gives
me
asthma
he
used
to
remark
reproachfully
It
was
only
when
one
got
him
on
to
the
year
1812
he
had
served
in
the
militia
and
had
received
a
bronze
medal
which
he
used
to
wear
on
festive
occasions
attached
to
a
Vladimir
ribbon
when
one
questioned
him
about
the
French
that
he
would
relate
some
few
anecdotes
He
used
however
to
maintain
stoutly
all
the
while
that
there
never
had
been
any
Frenchmen
real
ones
in
Russia
only
some
poor
marauders
who
had
straggled
over
from
hunger
and
that
he
had
given
many
a
good
drubbing
to
such
rabble
in
the
forests
And
yet
even
this
self-confident
unflinching
giant
had
his
moments
of
melancholy
and
depression
Without
any
visible
cause
he
would
suddenly
begin
to
be
sad
he
would
lock
himself
up
alone
in
his
room
and
hum
positively
hum
like
a
whole
hive
of
bees
or
he
would
call
his
page
Maximka
and
tell
him
to
read
aloud
to
him
out
of
the
solitary
book
which
had
somehow
found
its
way
into
his
house
an
odd
volume
of
Novikovsky
s
The
Worker
at
Leisure
or
else
to
sing
to
him
And
Maximka
who
by
some
strange
freak
of
chance
could
spell
out
print
syllable
by
syllable
would
set
to
work
with
the
usual
chopping
up
of
the
words
and
transference
of
the
accent
bawling
out
phrases
of
the
following
description
but
man
in
his
wilfulness
draws
from
this
empty
hypothesis
which
he
applies
to
the
animal
kingdom
utterly
opposite
conclusions
Every
animal
separately
he
says
is
not
capable
of
making
me
happy
and
so
on
Or
he
would
chant
in
a
shrill
little
voice
a
mournful
song
of
which
nothing
could
be
distinguished
but
Ee
eee
ee
a
ee
a
ee
Aaa
ska
O
oo
oo
bee
ee
ee
ee
la
While
Martin
Petrovitch
would
shake
his
head
make
allusions
to
the
mutability
of
life
how
all
things
turn
to
ashes
fade
away
like
grass
pass
and
will
return
