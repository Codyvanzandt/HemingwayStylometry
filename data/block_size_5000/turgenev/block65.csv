went
on
how
respectful
he
is
how
attentive
even
in
his
sorrow
He
has
promised
not
to
desert
me
Ah
I
can
never
bear
that
Ah
my
head
aches
fit
to
split
Send
me
Palashka
You
will
be
the
death
of
me
if
you
don
t
think
better
of
it
do
you
hear
And
calling
her
twice
an
ungrateful
girl
Marya
Dmitrievna
dismissed
her
She
went
to
her
own
room
But
she
had
not
had
time
to
recover
from
her
interviews
with
Panshin
and
her
mother
before
another
storm
broke
over
head
and
this
time
from
a
quarter
from
which
she
would
least
have
expected
it
Marfa
Timofyevna
came
into
her
room
and
at
once
slammed
the
door
after
her
The
old
lady
s
face
was
pale
her
cap
was
awry
her
eyes
were
flashing
and
her
hands
and
lips
were
trembling
Lisa
was
astonished
she
had
never
before
seen
her
sensible
and
reasonable
aunt
in
such
a
condition
A
pretty
thing
miss
Marfa
Timofyevna
began
in
a
shaking
and
broken
whisper
a
pretty
thing
Who
taught
you
such
ways
I
should
like
to
know
miss
Give
me
some
water
I
can
t
speak
Calm
yourself
auntie
what
is
the
matter
said
Lisa
giving
her
a
glass
of
water
Why
I
thought
you
did
not
think
much
of
Mr
Panshin
yourself
Marfa
Timofyevna
pushed
away
the
glass
I
can
t
drink
I
shall
knock
my
last
teeth
out
if
I
try
to
What
s
Panshin
to
do
with
it
Why
bring
Panshin
in
You
had
better
tell
me
who
has
taught
you
to
make
appointments
at
night
eh
miss
Lisa
turned
pale
Now
please
don
t
try
to
deny
it
pursued
Marfa
Timofyevna
Shurotchka
herself
saw
it
all
and
told
me
I
have
had
to
forbid
her
chattering
but
she
is
not
a
liar
I
don
t
deny
it
auntie
Lisa
uttered
scarcely
audibly
Ah
ah
That
s
it
is
it
miss
you
made
an
appointment
with
him
that
old
sinner
who
seems
so
meek
No
How
then
I
went
down
into
the
drawing-room
for
a
book
he
was
in
the
garden
and
he
called
me
And
you
went
A
pretty
thing
So
you
love
him
eh
I
love
him
answered
Lisa
softly
Merciful
Heavens
She
loves
him
Marfa
Timofyevna
snatched
off
her
cap
She
loves
a
married
man
Ah
she
loves
him
He
told
me
began
Lisa
What
has
he
told
you
the
scoundrel
eh
He
told
me
that
his
wife
was
dead
Marfa
Timofyevna
crossed
herself
Peace
be
with
her
she
muttered
she
was
a
vain
hussy
God
forgive
her
So
then
he
s
a
widower
I
suppose
And
he
s
losing
no
time
I
see
He
has
buried
one
wife
and
now
he
s
after
another
He
s
a
nice
person
only
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
niece
in
my
day
when
I
was
young
harm
came
to
young
girls
from
such
goings
on
Don
t
be
angry
with
me
my
girl
only
fools
are
angry
at
the
truth
I
have
given
orders
not
to
admit
him
to-day
I
love
him
but
I
shall
never
forgive
him
for
this
Upon
my
word
a
widower
Give
me
some
water
But
as
for
your
sending
Panshin
about
his
business
I
think
you
re
a
first-rate
girl
for
that
Only
don
t
you
go
sitting
of
nights
with
any
animals
of
that
sort
don
t
break
my
old
heart
or
else
you
ll
see
I
m
not
all
fondness
I
can
bite
too
a
widower
Marfa
Timofyevna
went
off
and
Lisa
sat
down
in
a
corner
and
began
to
cry
There
was
bitterness
in
her
soul
She
had
not
deserved
such
humiliation
Love
had
proved
no
happiness
to
her
she
was
weeping
for
a
second
time
since
yesterday
evening
This
new
unexpected
feeling
had
only
just
arisen
in
her
heart
and
already
what
a
heavy
price
she
had
paid
for
it
how
coarsely
had
strange
hands
touched
her
sacred
secret
She
felt
ashamed
and
bitter
and
sick
but
she
had
no
doubt
and
no
dread
and
Lavretsky
was
dearer
to
her
than
ever
She
had
hesitated
while
she
did
not
understand
herself
but
after
that
meeting
after
that
kiss
she
could
hesitate
no
more
she
knew
that
she
loved
and
now
she
loved
honestly
and
seriously
she
was
bound
firmly
for
all
her
life
and
she
did
not
fear
reproaches
She
felt
that
by
no
violence
could
they
break
that
bond
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
much
agitated
when
she
received
the
announcement
of
the
arrival
of
Varvara
Pavlovna
Lavretsky
she
did
not
even
know
whether
to
receive
her
she
was
afraid
of
giving
offence
to
Fedor
Ivanitch
At
last
curiosity
prevailed
Why
she
reflected
she
too
is
a
relation
and
taking
up
her
position
in
an
arm-chair
she
said
to
the
footman
Show
her
in
A
few
moments
passed
the
door
opened
Varvara
Pavlovna
swiftly
and
with
scarcely
audible
steps
approached
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
not
allowing
her
to
rise
from
her
chair
bent
almost
on
her
knees
before
her
I
thank
you
dear
aunt
she
began
in
a
soft
voice
full
of
emotion
speaking
Russian
I
thank
you
I
did
not
hope
for
such
condescension
on
your
part
you
are
an
angel
of
goodness
As
she
uttered
these
words
Varvara
Pavlovna
quite
unexpectedly
took
possession
of
one
of
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
hands
and
pressing
it
lightly
in
her
pale
lavender
gloves
she
raised
it
in
a
fawning
way
to
her
full
rosy
lips
Marya
Dmitrievna
quite
lost
her
head
seeing
such
a
handsome
and
charmingly
dressed
woman
almost
at
her
feet
She
did
not
know
where
she
was
And
she
tried
to
withdraw
her
hand
while
at
the
same
time
she
was
inclined
to
make
her
sit
down
and
to
say
something
affectionate
to
her
She
ended
by
raising
Varvara
Pavlovna
and
kissing
her
on
her
smooth
perfumed
brow
Varvara
Pavlovna
was
completely
overcome
by
this
kiss
How
do
you
do
bonjour
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
Of
course
I
did
not
expect
but
of
course
I
am
glad
to
see
you
You
understand
my
dear
it
s
not
for
me
to
judge
between
man
and
wife
My
husband
is
in
the
right
in
everything
Varvara
Pavlovna
interposed
I
alone
am
to
blame
That
is
a
very
praiseworthy
feeling
rejoined
Marya
Dmitrievna
very
Have
you
been
here
long
Have
you
seen
him
But
sit
down
please
I
arrived
yesterday
answered
Varvara
Pavlovna
sitting
down
meekly
I
have
seen
Fedor
Ivanitch
I
have
talked
with
him
Ah
Well
and
how
was
he
I
was
afraid
my
sudden
arrival
would
provoke
his
anger
continued
Varvara
Pavlovna
but
he
did
not
refuse
to
see
me
That
is
to
say
he
did
not
Yes
yes
I
understand
commented
Marya
Dmitrievna
He
is
only
a
little
rough
on
the
surface
but
his
heart
is
soft
Fedor
Ivanitch
has
not
forgiven
me
he
would
not
hear
me
But
he
was
so
good
as
to
assign
me
Lavriky
as
a
place
of
residence
Ah
a
splendid
estate
I
am
setting
off
there
to-morrow
in
fulfilment
of
his
wish
but
I
esteemed
it
a
duty
to
visit
you
first
I
am
very
very
much
obliged
to
you
my
dear
Relations
ought
never
to
forget
one
another
And
do
you
know
I
am
surprised
how
well
you
speak
Russian
C
est
etonnant
Varvara
Pavlovna
sighed
I
have
been
too
long
abroad
Marya
Dmitrievna
I
know
that
but
my
heart
has
always
been
Russian
and
I
have
not
forgotten
my
country
Ah
ah
that
is
good
Fedor
Ivanitch
did
not
however
expect
you
at
all
Yes
you
may
trust
my
experience
la
patri
avant
tout
Ah
show
me
if
you
please-what
a
charming
mantle
you
have
Do
you
like
it
Varvara
Pavlovna
slipped
it
quickly
off
her
shoulders
it
is
a
very
simple
little
thing
from
Madame
Baudran
One
can
see
it
at
once
From
Madame
Baudran
How
sweet
and
what
taste
I
am
sure
you
have
brought
a
number
of
fascinating
things
with
you
If
I
could
only
see
them
All
my
things
are
at
your
service
dearest
auntie
If
you
permit
I
can
show
some
patterns
to
your
maid
I
have
a
woman
with
me
from
Paris
a
wonderfully
clever
dressmaker
You
are
very
good
my
dear
But
really
I
am
ashamed
Ashamed
repeated
Varvara
Pavlovna
reproachfully
If
you
want
to
make
me
happy
dispose
of
me
as
if
I
were
your
property
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
completely
melted
Vous
etes
charmante
she
said
But
why
don
t
you
take
off
your
hat
and
gloves
What
you
will
allow
me
asked
Varvara
Pavlovna
and
slightly
as
though
with
emotion
clasped
her
hands
Of
course
you
will
dine
with
us
I
hope
I
I
will
introduce
you
to
my
daughter
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
a
little
confused
Well
we
are
in
for
it
here
goes
she
thought
She
is
not
very
well
to-day
O
ma
tante
how
good
you
are
cried
Varvara
Pavlovna
and
she
raised
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
A
page
announced
the
arrival
of
Gedeonovsky
The
old
gossip
came
in
bowing
and
smiling
Marya
Dmitrievna
presented
him
to
her
visitor
He
was
thrown
into
confusion
for
the
first
moment
but
Varvara
Pavlovna
behaved
with
such
coquettish
respectfulness
to
him
that
his
ears
began
to
tingle
and
gossip
slander
and
civility
dropped
like
honey
from
his
lips
Varvara
Pavlovna
listened
to
him
with
a
restrained
smile
and
began
by
degrees
to
talk
herself
She
spoke
modestly
of
Paris
of
her
travels
of
Baden
twice
she
made
Marya
Dmitrievna
laugh
and
each
time
she
sighed
a
little
afterwards
and
seemed
to
be
inwardly
reproaching
herself
for
misplaced
levity
She
obtained
permission
to
bring
Ada
taking
off
her
gloves
with
her
smooth
hands
redolent
of
soap
a
la
guimauve
she
showed
how
and
where
flounces
were
worn
and
ruches
and
lace
and
rosettes
She
promised
to
bring
a
bottle
of
the
new
English
scent
Victoria
Essence
and
was
as
happy
as
a
child
when
Marya
Dmitrievna
consented
to
accept
it
as
a
gift
She
was
moved
to
tears
over
the
recollection
of
the
emotion
she
experienced
when
for
the
first
time
she
heard
the
Russian
bells
They
went
so
deeply
to
my
heart
she
explained
At
that
instant
Lisa
came
in
Ever
since
the
morning
from
the
very
instant
when
chill
with
horror
she
had
read
Lavretsky
s
note
Lisa
had
been
preparing
herself
for
the
meeting
with
his
wife
She
had
a
presentiment
that
she
would
see
her
She
resolved
not
to
avoid
her
as
a
punishment
of
her
as
she
called
them
sinful
hopes
The
sudden
crisis
in
her
destiny
had
shaken
her
to
the
foundations
In
some
two
hours
her
face
seemed
to
have
grown
thin
But
she
did
not
shed
a
single
tear
It
s
what
I
deserve
she
said
to
herself
repressing
with
difficulty
and
dismay
some
bitter
impulses
of
hatred
which
frightened
her
in
her
soul
Well
I
must
go
down
she
thought
directly
she
heard
of
Madame
Lavretsky
s
arrival
and
she
went
down
She
stood
a
long
while
at
the
drawing-room
door
before
she
could
summon
up
courage
to
open
it
With
the
thought
I
have
done
her
wrong
she
crossed
the
threshold
and
forced
herself
to
look
at
her
forced
herself
to
smile
Varvara
Pavlovna
went
to
meet
her
directly
she
caught
sight
of
her
and
bowed
to
her
slightly
but
still
respectfully
Allow
me
to
introduce
myself
she
began
in
an
insinuating
voice
your
maman
is
so
indulgent
to
me
that
I
hope
that
you
too
will
be
good
to
me
The
expression
of
Varvara
Pavlovna
when
she
uttered
these
last
words
cold
and
at
the
same
time
soft
her
hypocritical
smile
the
action
of
her
hands
and
her
shoulders
her
very
dress
her
whole
being
aroused
such
a
feeling
of
repulsion
in
Lisa
that
she
could
make
no
reply
to
her
and
only
held
out
her
hand
with
an
effort
This
young
lady
disdains
me
thought
Varvara
Pavlovna
warmly
pressing
Lisa
s
cold
fingers
and
turning
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
she
observed
in
an
undertone
mais
elle
est
delicieuse
Lisa
faintly
flushed
she
heard
ridicule
insult
in
this
exclamation
But
she
resolved
not
to
trust
her
impressions
and
sat
down
by
the
window
at
her
embroidery-frame
Even
here
Varvara
Pavlovna
did
not
leave
her
in
peace
She
began
to
admire
her
taste
her
skill
Lisa
s
heart
beat
violently
and
painfully
She
could
scarcely
control
herself
she
could
scarcely
sit
in
her
place
It
seemed
to
her
that
Varvara
Pavlovna
knew
all
and
was
mocking
at
her
in
secret
triumph
To
her
relief
Gedeonovsky
began
to
talk
to
Varvara
Pavlovna
and
drew
off
her
attention
Lisa
bent
over
her
frame
and
secretly
watched
her
That
woman
she
thought
was
loved
by
him
But
she
at
once
drove
away
the
very
thought
of
Lavretsky
she
was
afraid
of
losing
her
control
over
herself
she
felt
that
her
head
was
going
round
Marya
Dmitrievna
began
to
talk
of
music
I
have
heard
my
dear
she
began
that
you
are
a
wonderful
performer
It
is
long
since
I
have
played
replied
Varvara
Pavlovna
seating
herself
without
delay
at
the
piano
and
running
her
fingers
smartly
over
the
keys
Do
you
wish
it
If
you
will
be
so
kind
Varvara
Pavlovna
played
a
brilliant
and
difficult
etude
by
Hertz
very
correctly
She
had
great
power
and
execution
Sylphide
cried
Gedeonovsky
Marvellous
Marya
Dmitrievna
chimed
in
Well
Varvara
Pavlovna
I
confess
she
observed
for
the
first
time
calling
her
by
her
name
you
have
astonished
me
you
might
give
concerts
We
have
a
musician
here
an
old
German
a
queer
fellow
but
a
very
clever
musician
He
gives
Lisa
lessons
He
will
be
simply
crazy
over
you
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
is
also
musical
asked
Varvara
Pavlovna
turning
her
head
slightly
towards
her
Yes
she
plays
fairly
and
is
fond
of
music
but
what
is
that
beside
you
But
there
is
one
young
man
here
too
with
whom
we
must
make
you
acquainted
He
is
an
artist
in
soul
and
composes
very
charmingly
He
alone
will
be
able
to
appreciate
you
fully
A
young
man
said
Varvara
Pavlovna
Who
is
he
Some
poor
man
Oh
dear
no
our
chief
beau
and
not
only
among
us
et
a
Petersbourg
A
kammer-junker
and
received
in
the
best
society
You
must
have
heard
of
him
Panshin
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
He
is
here
on
a
government
commission
future
minister
I
daresay
And
an
artist
An
artist
at
heart
and
so
well-bred
You
shall
see
him
He
has
been
here
very
often
of
late
I
invited
him
for
this
evening
I
hope
he
will
come
added
Marya
Dmitrievna
with
a
gentle
sigh
and
an
oblique
smile
of
bitterness
Lisa
knew
the
meaning
of
this
smile
but
it
was
nothing
to
her
now
And
young
repeated
Varvara
Pavlovna
lightly
modulating
from
tone
to
tone
Twenty-eight
and
of
the
most
prepossessing
appearance
Un
jeune
homme
acompli
indeed
An
exemplary
young
man
one
may
say
observed
Gedeonovsky
Varvara
Pavlovna
began
suddenly
playing
a
noisy
waltz
of
Strauss
opening
with
such
a
loud
and
rapid
trill
that
Gedeonovsky
was
quite
startled
In
the
very
middle
of
the
waltz
she
suddenly
passed
into
a
pathetic
motive
and
finished
up
with
an
air
from
Lucia
Fra
poco
She
reflected
that
lively
music
was
not
in
keeping
with
her
position
The
air
from
Lucia
with
emphasis
on
the
sentimental
passages
moved
Marya
Dmitrievna
greatly
What
soul
she
observed
in
an
undertone
to
Gedeonovsky
A
sylphide
repeated
Gedeonovsky
raising
his
eyes
towards
heaven
The
dinner
hour
arrived
Marfa
Timofyevna
came
down
from
up-stairs
when
the
soup
was
already
on
the
table
She
treated
Varvara
Pavlovna
very
drily
replied
in
half-sentences
to
her
civilities
and
did
not
look
at
her
Varvara
Pavlovna
soon
realised
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
this
old
lady
and
gave
up
trying
to
talk
to
her
To
make
up
for
this
Marya
Dmitrievna
became
still
more
cordial
to
her
guest
her
aunt
s
discourtesy
irritated
her
Marfa
Timofyevna
however
did
not
only
avoid
looking
at
Varvara
Pavlovna
she
did
not
look
at
Lisa
either
though
her
eyes
seemed
literally
blazing
She
sat
as
though
she
were
of
stone
yellow
and
pale
her
lips
compressed
and
ate
nothing
Lisa
seemed
calm
and
in
reality
her
heart
was
more
at
rest
a
strange
apathy
the
apathy
of
the
condemned
had
come
upon
her
At
dinner
Varvara
Pavlovna
spoke
little
she
seemed
to
have
grown
timid
again
and
her
countenance
was
overspread
with
an
expression
of
modest
melancholy
Gedeonovsky
alone
enlivened
the
conversation
with
his
tales
though
he
constantly
looked
timorously
towards
Marfa
Timofyevna
and
coughed
he
was
always
overtaken
by
a
fit
of
coughing
when
he
was
going
to
tell
a
lie
in
her
presence
but
she
did
not
hinder
him
by
any
interruption
After
dinner
it
seemed
that
Varvara
Pavlovna
was
quite
devoted
to
preference
at
this
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
so
delighted
that
she
felt
quite
overcome
and
thought
to
herself
Really
what
a
fool
Fedor
Ivanitch
must
be
not
able
to
appreciate
a
woman
like
this
She
sat
down
to
play
cards
together
with
her
and
Gedeonovsky
and
Marfa
Timofyevna
led
Lisa
away
up-stairs
with
her
saying
that
she
looked
shocking
and
that
she
must
certainly
have
a
headache
Yes
she
has
an
awful
headache
observed
Marya
Dmitrievna
turning
to
Varvara
Pavlovna
and
rolling
her
eyes
I
myself
have
often
just
such
sick
headaches
Really
rejoined
Varvara
Pavlovna
Lisa
went
into
her
aunt
s
room
and
sank
powerless
into
a
chair
Marfa
Timofyevna
gazed
long
at
her
in
silence
slowly
she
knelt
down
before
her
and
began
still
in
the
same
silence
to
kiss
her
hands
alternately
Lisa
bent
forward
crimsoning
and
began
to
weep
but
she
did
not
make
Marfa
Timofyevna
get
up
she
did
not
take
away
her
hands
she
felt
that
she
had
not
the
right
to
take
them
away
that
she
had
not
the
right
to
hinder
the
old
lady
from
expressing
her
penitence
and
her
sympathy
from
begging
forgiveness
for
what
had
passed
the
day
before
And
Marfa
Timofyevna
could
not
kiss
enough
those
poor
pale
powerless
hands
and
silent
tears
flowed
from
her
eyes
and
from
Lisa
s
while
the
cat
Matross
purred
in
the
wide
arm-chair
among
the
knitting
wool
and
the
long
flame
of
the
little
lamp
faintly
stirred
and
flickered
before
the
holy
picture
In
the
next
room
behind
the
door
stood
Nastasya
Karpovna
and
she
too
was
furtively
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
check
pocket-handkerchief
rolled
up
in
a
ball
Meanwhile
down-stairs
preference
was
going
on
merrily
in
the
drawing-room
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
winning
and
was
in
high
good-humour
A
servant
came
in
and
announced
that
Panshin
was
below
Marya
Dmitrievna
dropped
her
cards
and
moved
restlessly
in
her
arm-chair
Varvara
Pavlovna
looked
at
her
with
a
half-smile
then
turned
her
eyes
towards
the
door
Panshin
made
his
appearance
in
a
black
frock-coat
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
and
a
high
English
collar
It
was
hard
for
me
to
obey
but
you
see
I
have
come
this
was
what
was
expressed
by
his
unsmiling
freshly
shaven
countenance
Well
Woldemar
cried
Marya
Dmitrievna
you
used
to
come
in
unannounced
Panshin
only
replied
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
by
a
single
glance
He
bowed
courteously
to
her
but
did
not
kiss
her
hand
She
presented
him
to
Varvara
Pavlovna
he
stepped
back
a
pace
bowed
to
her
with
the
same
courtesy
but
with
still
greater
elegance
and
respect
and
took
a
seat
near
the
card-table
The
game
of
preference
was
soon
over
Panshin
inquired
after
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
learnt
that
she
was
not
quite
well
and
expressed
his
regret
Then
he
began
to
talk
to
Varvara
Pavlovna
diplomatically
weighing
each
word
and
giving
it
its
full
value
and
politely
hearing
her
answers
to
the
end
But
the
dignity
of
his
diplomatic
tone
did
not
impress
Varvara
Pavlovna
and
she
did
not
adopt
it
On
the
contrary
she
looked
him
in
the
face
with
light-hearted
attention
and
talked
easily
while
her
delicate
nostrils
were
quivering
as
though
with
suppressed
laughter
Marya
Dmitrievna
began
to
enlarge
on
her
talent
Panshin
courteously
inclined
his
head
so
far
as
his
collar
would
permit
him
declared
that
he
felt
sure
of
it
beforehand
and
almost
turned
the
conversation
to
the
diplomatic
topic
of
Metternich
himself
Varvara
Pavlovna
with
an
expressive
look
in
her
velvety
eyes
said
in
a
low
voice
Why
but
you
too
are
an
artist
un
confrere
adding
still
lower
venez
with
a
nod
towards
the
piano
The
single
word
venez
thrown
at
him
instantly
as
though
by
magic
effected
a
complete
transformation
in
Panshin
s
whole
appearance
His
care-worn
air
disappeared
he
smiled
and
grew
lively
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
repeating
a
poor
artist
alas
Now
you
I
have
heard
are
a
real
artist
he
followed
Varvara
Pavlovna
to
the
piano
Make
him
sing
his
song
How
the
Moon
Floats
cried
Marya
Dmitrievna
Do
you
sing
said
Varvara
Pavlovna
enfolding
him
in
a
rapid
radiant
look
Sit
down
Panshin
began
to
cry
off
Sit
down
she
repeated
insistently
tapping
on
a
chair
behind
him
He
sat
down
coughed
tugged
at
his
collar
and
sang
his
song
Charmant
pronounced
Varvara
Pavlovna
you
sing
very
well
vous
avez
du
style
again
She
walked
round
the
piano
and
stood
just
opposite
Panshin
He
sang
it
again
increasing
the
melodramatic
tremor
in
his
voice
Varvara
Pavlovna
stared
steadily
at
him
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
piano
and
holding
her
white
hands
on
a
level
with
her
lips
Panshin
finished
the
song
Charmant
charmant
idee
she
said
with
the
calm
self-confidence
of
a
connoisseur
Tell
me
have
you
composed
anything
for
a
woman
s
voice
for
a
mezzo-soprano
I
hardly
compose
at
all
replied
Panshin
That
was
only
thrown
off
in
the
intervals
of
business
but
do
you
sing
Yes
Oh
sing
us
something
urged
Marya
Dmitrievna
Varvara
Pavlovna
pushed
her
hair
back
off
her
glowing
cheeks
and
gave
her
head
a
little
shake
Our
voices
ought
to
go
well
together
she
observed
turning
to
Panshin
let
us
sing
a
duet
Do
you
know
Son
geloso
or
La
ci
darem
or
Mira
la
bianca
luna
I
used
to
sing
Mira
la
bianca
luna
once
replied
Panshin
but
long
ago
I
have
forgotten
it
Never
mind
we
will
rehearse
it
in
a
low
voice
Allow
me
Varvara
Pavlovna
sat
down
at
the
piano
Panshin
stood
by
her
They
sang
through
the
duet
in
an
undertone
and
Varvara
Pavlovna
corrected
him
several
times
as
they
did
so
then
they
sang
it
aloud
and
then
twice
repeated
the
performance
of
Mira
la
bianca
lu-u-na
Varvara
Pavlovna
s
voice
had
lost
its
freshness
but
she
managed
it
with
great
skill
Panshin
at
first
was
hesitating
and
a
little
out
of
tune
then
he
warmed
up
and
if
his
singing
was
not
quite
beyond
criticism
at
least
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
swayed
his
whole
person
and
lifted
his
hand
from
time
to
time
in
the
most
genuine
style
Varvara
Pavlovna
played
two
or
three
little
things
of
Thalberg
s
and
coquettishly
rendered
a
little
French
ballad
Marya
Dmitrievna
did
not
know
how
to
express
her
delight
she
several
times
tried
to
send
for
Lisa
Gedeonovsky
too
was
at
a
loss
for
words
and
could
only
nod
his
head
but
all
at
once
he
gave
an
unexpected
yawn
and
hardly
had
time
to
cover
his
mouth
with
his
hand
This
yawn
did
not
escape
Varvara
Pavlovna
she
at
once
turned
her
back
on
the
piano
observing
Assez
de
musique
comme
ca
let
us
talk
and
she
folded
her
arms
Oui
assez
de
musique
repeated
Panshin
gaily
and
at
once
he
dropped
into
a
chat
alert
light
and
in
French
Precisely
as
in
the
best
Parisian
salon
thought
Marya
Dmitrievna
as
she
listened
to
their
fluent
and
quick-witted
sentences
Panshin
had
a
sense
of
complete
satisfaction
his
eyes
shone
and
he
smiled
At
first
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
face
contracted
his
brows
and
sighed
spasmodically
whenever
he
chanced
to
encounter
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
eyes
But
later
on
he
forgot
her
altogether
and
gave
himself
up
entirely
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
half-worldly
half-artistic
chat
Varvara
Pavlovna
proved
to
be
a
great
philosopher
she
had
a
ready
answer
for
everything
she
never
hesitated
never
doubted
about
anything
one
could
see
that
she
had
conversed
much
with
clever
men
of
all
kinds
All
her
ideas
all
her
feelings
revolved
round
Paris
Panshin
turned
the
conversation
upon
literature
it
seemed
that
like
himself
she
read
only
French
books
George
Sand
drove
her
to
exasperation
Balzac
she
respected
but
he
wearied
her
in
Sue
and
Scribe
she
saw
great
knowledge
of
human
nature
Dumas
and
Feval
she
adored
In
her
heart
she
preferred
Paul
de
Kock
to
all
of
them
but
of
course
she
did
not
even
mention
his
name
To
tell
the
truth
literature
had
no
great
interest
for
her
Varvara
Pavlovna
very
skilfully
avoided
all
that
could
even
remotely
recall
her
position
there
was
no
reference
to
love
in
her
remarks
on
the
contrary
they
were
rather
expressive
of
austerity
in
regard
to
the
allurements
of
passion
of
disillusionment
and
resignation
Panshin
disputed
with
her
she
did
not
agree
with
him
but
strange
to
say
at
the
very
time
when
words
of
censure-often
of
severe
censure
were
coming
from
her
lips
these
words
had
a
soft
caressing
sound
and
her
eyes
spoke
precisely
what
those
lovely
eyes
spoke
it
was
hard
to
say
but
at
least
their
utterances
were
anything
but
severe
and
were
full
of
undefined
sweetness
Panshin
tried
to
interpret
their
secret
meaning
he
tried
to
make
his
own
eyes
speak
but
he
felt
he
was
not
successful
he
was
conscious
that
Varvara
Pavlovna
in
the
character
of
a
real
lioness
from
abroad
stood
high
above
him
and
consequently
was
not
completely
master
of
himself
Varvara
Pavlovna
had
a
habit
in
conversation
of
lightly
touching
the
sleeve
of
the
person
she
was
talking
to
those
momentary
contacts
had
a
most
disquieting
influence
on
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
Varvara
Pavlovna
possessed
the
faculty
of
getting
on
easily
with
every
one
before
two
hours
had
passed
it
seemed
to
Panshin
that
he
had
known
her
for
an
age
and
Lisa
the
same
Lisa
whom
at
any-rate
he
had
loved
to
whom
he
had
the
evening
before
offered
his
hand
had
vanished
as
it
were
into
a
mist
Tea
was
brought
in
the
conversation
became
still
more
unconstrained
Marya
Dmitrievna
rang
for
the
page
and
gave
orders
to
ask
Lisa
to
come
down
if
her
head
were
better
Panshin
hearing
Lisa
s
name
fell
to
discussing
self-sacrifice
and
the
question
which
was
more
capable
of
sacrifice
man
or
woman
Marya
Dmitrievna
at
once
became
excited
began
to
maintain
that
woman
is
more
the
ready
for
sacrifice
declared
that
she
would
prove
it
in
a
couple
of
words
got
confused
and
finished
up
by
a
rather
unfortunate
comparison
Varvara
Pavlovna
took
up
a
music-book
and
half-hiding
behind
it
and
bending
towards
Panshin
she
observed
in
a
whisper
as
she
nibbled
a
biscuit
with
a
serene
smile
on
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
Elle
n
a
pas
invente
la
poudre
la
bonne
dame
Panshin
was
a
little
taken
aback
and
amazed
at
Varvara
Pavlovna
s
audacity
but
he
did
not
realise
how
much
contempt
for
himself
was
concealed
in
this
unexpected
outbreak
and
forgetting
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
kindness
and
devotion
forgetting
all
the
dinners
she
had
given
him
and
the
money
she
had
lent
him
he
replied
luckless
mortal
with
the
same
smile
and
in
the
same
tone
je
crois
bien
and
not
even
je
crois
bien
but
j
crois
ben
Varvara
flung
him
a
friendly
glance
and
got
up
Lisa
came
in
Marfa
Timofyevna
had
tried
in
vain
to
hinder
her
she
was
resolved
to
go
through
with
her
sufferings
to
the
end
Varvara
Pavlovna
went
to
meet
her
together
with
Panshin
on
whose
face
the
former
diplomatic
expression
had
reappeared
How
are
you
he
asked
Lisa
I
am
better
now
thank
you
she
replied
We
have
been
having
a
little
music
here
it
s
a
pity
you
did
not
hear
Varvara
Pavlovna
she
sings
superbly
en
artiste
consommee
Come
here
my
dear
sounded
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
voice
Varvara
Pavlovna
went
to
her
at
once
with
the
submissiveness
of
a
child
and
sat
down
on
a
little
stool
at
her
feet
Marya
Dmitrievna
had
called
her
so
as
to
leave
her
daughter
at
least
for
a
moment
alone
with
Panshin
she
was
still
secretly
hoping
that
she
would
come
round
Besides
an
idea
had
entered
her
head
to
which
she
was
anxious
to
give
expression
at
once
Do
you
know
she
whispered
to
Varvara
Pavlovna
I
want
to
endeavour
to
reconcile
you
and
your
husband
I
won
t
answer
for
my
success
but
I
will
make
an
effort
He
has
you
know
a
great
respect
for
me
Varvara
Pavlovna
slowly
raised
her
eyes
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
eloquently
clasped
her
hands
You
would
be
my
saviour
ma
tante
she
said
in
a
mournful
voice
I
don
t
know
how
to
thank
you
for
all
your
kindness
but
I
have
been
too
guilty
towards
Fedor
Ivanitch
he
can
not
forgive
me
But
did
you
in
reality
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
beginning
inquisitively
Don
t
question
me
Varvara
Pavlovna
interrupted
her
and
she
cast
down
her
eyes
I
was
young
frivolous
But
I
don
t
want
to
justify
myself
Well
anyway
why
not
try
Don
t
despair
rejoined
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
patting
her
on
the
cheek
but
after
a
glance
at
her
she
had
not
the
courage
She
is
humble
very
humble
she
thought
but
still
she
is
a
lioness
Are
you
ill
Panshin
was
saying
to
Lisa
meanwhile
Yes
I
am
not
well
I
understand
you
he
brought
out
after
a
rather
protracted
silence
Yes
I
understand
you
What
I
understand
you
Panshin
repeated
significantly
he
simply
did
not
know
what
to
say
Lisa
felt
