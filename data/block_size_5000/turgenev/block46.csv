know
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Boris
Andreyitch
said
when
he
had
finished
his
story
and
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
friend
's
bed
room
What
I
think
is
that
a
young
man
often
does
n't
marry
because
he
thinks
it
dread
ful
to
put
his
life
into
bondage
he
thinks
'Why
should
I
be
in
a
hurry
I
've
plenty
of
time
perhaps
I
may
find
something
better
and
the
business
usually
ends
in
his
being
a
lonely
old
bachelor
or
marrying
the
first
woman
he
comes
across
It
's
all
due
to
pride
and
egoism
If
God
has
sent
you
a
sweet
good
girl
do
n't
lose
your
chance
be
happy
and
do
n't
be
too
par
ticular
I
shall
not
find
a
wife
better
than
Verotchka
and
if
she
is
somewhat
deficient
in
regard
to
education
it
will
be
my
work
to
look
after
that
She
has
rather
a
phlegmatic
char
acter
but
that
's
no
harm
quite
the
contrary
That
's
why
I
decided
so
quickly
And
if
I
have
made
a
mistake
he
added
and
stopped
short
after
thinking
a
little
he
went
on
there
's
no
great
harm
done
Nothing
would
have
come
of
my
life
anyway
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
listened
to
his
friend
in
silence
from
time
to
time
sipping
from
a
cracked
glass
the
very
nasty
tea
prepared
by
the
zealous
Makedonia
Why
do
n't
you
speak
Boris
Andreyitch
asked
him
at
last
coming
to
a
standstill
before
him
What
I
say
is
right
is
n't
it
You
agree
with
me
do
n't
you
The
proposal
has
been
made
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
rejoined
emphatically
The
father
has
given
his
blessing
the
daughter
has
not
refused
you
so
it
's
no
use
discussing
it
further
Per
haps
it
really
is
for
the
best
Now
it
's
the
wed
ding
we
must
think
about
not
discussing
its
wisdom
but
morning
brings
good
counsel
we
will
talk
it
over
properly
to-morrow
Hey
Boy
there
Take
Boris
Andreyitch
down
You
might
at
least
embrace
me
and
con
gratulate
me
said
Boris
Andreyitch
What
a
fellow
you
are
really
Embrace
you
I
certainly
will
with
pleas
ure
And
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
embraced
Boris
Andreyitch
God
give
you
all
earthly
happi
ness
The
friends
parted
It
's
all
because
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
said
aloud
to
himself
after
lying
for
some
time
in
bed
and
tossing
from
side
to
side
it
's
all
be
cause
he
has
not
served
in
the
army
He
has
grown
used
to
indulging
his
whims
and
knows
nothing
of
discipline
A
month
later
Vyazovnin
married
Ve
rotchka
He
insisted
that
the
wedding
should
not
be
put
off
longer
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
his
best
man
During
that
month
Vyazovnin
went
often
to
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
but
no
change
was
perceptible
in
his
behaviour
to
Ve
rotchka
and
her
behaviour
to
him
she
was
a
little
more
reserved
with
him
that
was
all
He
brought
her
Yurey
Miloslavsky
and
read
aloud
some
chapters
She
liked
Zagoskin's
novel
but
when
it
was
finished
she
did
not
ask
for
another
Karantyev
came
once
to
have
a
look
at
Verotchka
since
she
had
become
en
gaged
to
another
man
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
came
drunk
he
kept
gazing
at
her
as
though
he
were
going
to
say
something
but
said
nothing
He
was
asked
to
sing
He
sang
some
discon
solate
ditty
then
burst
into
a
gay
and
reckless
one
flung
down
the
guitar
on
the
sofa
said
good-bye
to
everyone
and
getting
into
his
sledge
flung
himself
face
downwards
on
the
hay
strewn
in
it
burst
into
sobs
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
dead
The
day
before
the
wedding
Verotchka
was
very
sad
and
Stepan
Petrovitch
was
low-spir
ited
too
He
had
hoped
that
Boris
Andreyitch
would
consent
to
come
and
live
with
him
The
latter
however
had
not
hinted
at
this
but
on
the
contrary
had
suggested
that
Stepan
Petrov
itch
might
stay
for
a
time
at
Vyazovno
The
old
man
had
refused
he
was
used
to
his
study
Verotchka
promised
to
visit
him
at
least
once
a
week
How
mournfully
her
father
answered
her
Bra-oo
Bra-oo
So
Boris
Andreyitch
began
his
life
as
a
mar
ried
man
Verotchka
being
an
excellent
house
keeper
put
his
whole
house
in
order
He
ad
mired
her
noiseless
but
careful
activity
her
mild
always
serene
rule
called
her
his
little
Dutchwoman
and
was
continually
repeating
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
that
he
had
never
before
known
what
happiness
was
It
must
be
ob
served
that
from
the
wedding
day
onwards
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
gave
up
visiting
him
so
often
and
staying
so
long
though
Boris
Andreyitch
received
him
as
warmly
as
ever
and
though
Verotchka
had
a
genuine
affection
for
him
Your
life
is
not
the
same
now
he
would
say
to
Vyazovnin
when
the
latter
reproached
him
affectionately
for
having
grown
colder
to
him
You
're
a
married
man
I
'm
a
bachelor
I
may
be
in
your
way
1
At
first
Vyazovnin
did
not
contradict
him
but
by
degrees
he
began
to
notice
that
he
was
dull
at
times
without
his
friend
His
wife
did
not
restrict
his
liberty
in
the
least
on
the
con
trary
he
sometimes
forgot
about
her
altogether
and
for
whole
mornings
at
a
stretch
would
not
say
a
single
word
to
her
though
he
always
looked
into
her
face
with
pleasure
and
tender
ness
though
every
time
she
passed
by
him
with
her
light
step
he
would
catch
her
hand
and
kiss
it
which
invariably
drew
a
smile
to
her
lips
the
smile
was
the
same
that
he
had
so
loved
but
is
a
smile
alone
enough
They
had
too
little
in
common
and
he
began
to
be
aware
of
it
There
's
no
denying
that
my
wife
has
very
few
resources
thought
Boris
Andreyitch
one
day
as
he
sat
with
folded
arms
on
the
sofa
The
words
Verotchka
had
said
to
him
on
the
lOI
day
of
his
proposal
I
am
not
a
match
for
you
echoed
in
his
heart
If
I
had
been
a
German
or
a
savant
he
pursued
his
reflections
or
if
I
had
had
some
constant
occupation
which
would
have
en
grossed
the
greater
part
of
my
time
such
a
wife
would
have
been
a
godsend
but
as
it
is
Can
I
have
made
a
mistake
This
last
thought
was
more
acutely
painful
to
him
than
he
had
expected
When
that
same
morning
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
repeated
that
he
could
not
but
be
in
his
way
Boris
Andreyitch
could
not
restrain
himself
and
exclaimed
Upon
my
word
you
're
not
in
the
least
in
our
way
on
the
contrar
when
you
are
here
we
are
both
ever
so
much
more
lively
he
had
almost
said
more
at
ease
and
it
was
certainly
true
Boris
Andreyitch
chatted
eagerly
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
exactly
as
he
had
done
before
his
marriage
and
Verotchka
could
talk
to
him
too
while
for
her
husband
she
felt
a
great
respect
and
with
all
her
unmistakable
devotion
to
him
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
how
to
enter
tain
him
Besides
she
saw
that
Pyotr
Vassilyitch's
presence
enlivened
him
It
ended
in
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
becoming
quite
an
indispensable
person
in
the
house
He
loved
Verotchka
as
though
she
were
his
daughter
and
indeed
no
one
could
help
loving
so
kind
and
good
a
creature
When
Boris
Andreyitch
with
human
weakness
con
fided
to
his
friend
his
secret
thoughts
and
grievances
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
blamed
him
se
verely
for
his
ingratitude
enumerated
all
Verotchka
's
virtues
and
once
in
answer
to
a
remark
of
Boris
Andreyitch
's
that
he
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
had
thought
that
they
were
not
made
for
each
other
the
latter
answered
angrily
that
he
did
not
deserve
her
I
have
found
nothing
in
her
muttered
Boris
Andreyitch
Found
nothing
in
her
Why
did
yoti
ex
pect
something
extraordinary
of
her
You've
found
an
excellent
wife
in
her
let
me
tell
you
that
That
's
true
Vyazovnin
hastily
assented
Everything
in
tlie
house
went
on
as
before
quietly
and
peacefully
For
it
was
not
only
impossible
to
quarrel
with
Verotchka
no
mis
understandings
even
could
exist
between
her
and
her
husband
yet
the
inner
rift
was
felt
in
everything
So
the
effect
of
an
unseen
inter
nal
wound
may
be
seen
in
a
man
's
whole
being
Verotchka
had
not
the
habit
of
complaining
besides
she
did
not
even
in
thought
blame
Vyazovnin
for
anything
and
it
never
entered
his
head
that
she
was
not
properly
satisfied
with
her
life
with
him
Only
two
people
clearly
un
derstood
her
position
her
old
father
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Stepan
Petrovitch
caressed
her
with
peculiar
sympathetic
compassion
and
looked
into
her
eyes
when
she
came
to
see
him
he
asked
her
no
questions
but
his
sighs
were
more
frequent
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
his
Bra-oo
Bra-oo
had
no
longer
the
note
of
the
imperturbable
calm
of
a
spirit
remote
from
all
things
earthly
He
seemed
to
have
become
pale
and
thin
since
he
had
been
parted
from
his
daughter
What
was
passing
in
her
soul
was
no
secret
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
either
Verotchka
did
not
in
the
least
expect
her
husband
to
pay
attention
to
her
or
even
to
talk
to
her
but
she
was
fretted
by
the
thought
that
she
was
a
burdeti
to
him
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
found
her
one
day
stand
ing
motionless
with
her
face
to
the
wall
Like
her
father
whom
she
greatly
resembled
she
did
not
like
to
display
her
tears
and
turned
aside
when
she
wept
even
if
she
were
alone
in
the
room
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
walked
softly
by
her
and
never
dropped
the
slightest
hint
that
could
give
her
ground
for
supposing
that
he
knew
why
she
was
standing
with
her
face
to
the
wall
But
he
gave
Vyazovnin
no
peace
he
did
not
it
is
true
utter
those
offensively
irritating
unnecessary
words
I
told
you
so
words
which
let
us
observe
in
parenthesis
the
best
of
people
can
not
refrain
from
uttering
even
in
the
moment
of
warmest
sympathy
But
he
attacked
Boris
Andreyitch
mercilessly
for
his
indifference
and
ennui
and
once
affected
him
so
much
that
he
ran
to
Verotchka
and
began
anx
iously
scrutinising
and
questioning
her
She
looked
at
him
so
gently
and
answered
him
so
calmly
that
he
went
away
inwardly
troubled
by
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
reproaches
but
thank
ful
that
Verotchka
anyway
suspected
noth
ing
So
passed
the
winter
Such
relations
can
not
last
long
they
either
end
in
a
rupture
or
undergo
a
change
rarely
for
the
better
Boris
Andreyitch
did
not
become
irritable
and
exacting
as
is
often
the
case
with
people
who
feel
they
are
in
the
wrong
he
did
not
per
mit
himself
the
cheap
and
often
even
in
intelli
gent
people
coarse
pleasure
of
mockery
and
gibing
he
did
not
sink
into
melancholy
he
sim
ply
began
to
be
absorbed
by
the
thought
of
how
to
get
away
for
a
time
of
course
To
travel
he
repeated
to
himself
as
he
got
up
in
the
morning
To
travel
he
whis
pered
as
he
got
into
bed
He
fotmd
an
enchanting
fascination
lay
hid
in
those
words
He
tried
by
way
of
distrac
tion
visiting
Sofya
Kirillovna
but
her
fluent
speech
and
her
free-and-easy
manners
her
lit
tle
smiles
and
airs
and
graces
seemed
to
him
very
mawkish
What
a
contrast
to
Ve
rotchka
he
thought
looking
at
the
emand
io6
pated
widow
and
yet
the
thought
of
getting
away
from
Verotchka
never
left
him
The
breath
of
the
coming
spring
spring
which
beckons
and
allures
the
very
birds
from
beyond
the
seas
dissipated
his
last
doubts
and
set
his
head
in
a
whirl
He
went
away
to
Petersburg
on
the
pretext
of
some
important
business
that
could
not
be
deferred
though
it
had
till
then
never
been
mentioned
As
he
parted
from
Verotchka
he
suddenly
felt
a
tightness
and
rush
of
blood
at
his
heart
he
felt
sorry
for
his
sweet
gentle
v/ife
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
and
bedewed
her
pale
forehead
which
he
had
only
just
touched
with
his
lips
v
I
shall
soon
soon
be
back
And
I
shall
write
my
darling
he
kept
repeating
And
commending
her
to
the
care
and
affec
tion
of
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
he
got
into
his
car
riage
touched
and
melancholy
His
melancholy
disappeared
instantly
at
the
sight
of
the
first
softly
green
willows
on
the
high-road
which
lay
a
mile
and
a
half
from
his
estate
An
unaccountable
almost
boyish
rapture
set
his
heart
throbbing
his
chest
heaved
and
he
fastened
his
eyes
greedily
on
the
distance
No
he
exclaimed
I
see
that
'The
fiery
steed
and
the
gentle
doe
Harnessed
together
can
not
go
But
was
he
a
fiery
steed
Vera
was
left
alone
but
in
the
first
place
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
visited
her
frequently
and
what
was
more
her
old
father
was
induced
to
tear
himself
from
his
beloved
abode
and
move
for
the
time
into
his
daughter
's
house
The
three
of
them
got
on
capitally
together
their
tastes
and
their
habits
were
so
completely
in
harmony
And
yet
Vyazovnin
was
not
for
gotten
by
them
on
the
contrary
he
served
them
as
an
unseen
spiritual
tie
They
were
in
cessantly
talking
of
him
of
his
cleverness
his
goodness
his
culture
and
the
simple
good
na
ture
of
his
behaviour
They
seemed
to
have
be
come
even
fonder
of
Boris
Andreyitch
in
his
ab
sence
from
home
The
weather
set
in
fine
the
days
did
not
fly
by
no
they
passed
peacefully
and
joyfully
like
high
bright
clouds
on
a
blue
and
clear
sky
Vyazovnin
wrote
from
time
to
io8
time
his
letters
were
read
and
re-read
with
great
pleasure
In
each
of
them
he
spoke
of
his
ap
proaching
return
At
last
one
day
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
received
the
following
letter
from
him
Dear
Friend
my
dear
kind
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
I
have
been
wondering
a
long
while
how
to
begin
this
letter
but
it
seems
that
the
best
way
is
to
tell
you
straight
out
that
I
am
going
abroad
The
news
I
know
will
surprise
you
and
even
make
you
angry
you
could
not
have
expected
this
and
you
will
be
perfectly
right
if
you
call
me
an
irresponsible
and
un
reasonable
person
I
do
not
mean
indeed
to
defend
myself
and
even
at
this
moment
I
am
conscious
that
I
am
blushing
but
have
the
pa
tience
to
hear
me
out
In
the
first
place
I
am
going
for
a
very
short
time
and
in
such
so
ciety
and
such
favourable
conditions
as
you
can
hardly
imagine
and
in
the
second
I
am
firmly
convinced
that
after
playing
the
fool
for
the
last
time
after
satisfying
for
the
last
time
my
passion
for
seeing
everything
and
hav
ing
every
experience
I
shall
become
an
excel
lent
husband
and
a
stay-at-home
family
man
and
shall
show
that
I
know
how
to
value
the
undeserved
kindness
of
destiny
in
presenting
me
with
such
a
wife
as
Verotchka
Please
persuade
her
of
this
too
and
show
her
this
letter
I
am
not
writing
to
her
now
I
have
not
the
courage
but
I
shall
certainly
write
from
Stettin
for
which
our
steamer
is
bound
and
meanwhile
tell
her
that
I
am
on
my
knees
before
her
and
humbly
beg
her
not
to
be
cross
with
her
stupid
husband
Know
ing
her
angelic
character
I
am
certain
she
will
forgive
me
and
I
swear
by
everything
in
the
world
that
in
three
months
not
a
day
later
I
will
be
back
at
Vyazovno
and
then
no
force
shall
drag
me
away
till
the
end
of
my
days
Good
bye
or
rather
till
we
meet
soon
I
embrace
you
and
kiss
the
sweet
hands
of
my
Verotchka
I
shall
write
to
you
from
Stettin
where
you
can
send
me
letters
If
anything
unforeseen
should
happen
and
in
regard
to
the
manage
ment
of
the
place
generally
I
rely
upon
you
as
upon
a
wall
of
stone
Your
Boris
Vyazovnin
P
S
Have
my
study
repapered
for
the
au
tumn
Do
you
hear
Be
sure
to
no
Alas
the
hopes
expressed
by
Boris
An
dreyitch
in
this
letter
were
not
destined
to
be
fulfilled
Owing
to
the
great
number
of
impressions
he
received
and
things
he
had
to
do
he
had
not
time
to
write
to
Verotchka
from
Stettin
but
from
Hamburg
he
sent
her
a
letter
in
which
he
informed
her
of
his
intention
to
visit
for
the
sake
of
inspecting
certain
indus
trial
institutions
and
also
listening
to
certain
necessary
lectures
Paris
where
he
begged
her
to
forward
letters
Poste
Restante
Vyazovnin
arrived
in
Paris
in
the
morning
and
after
in
the
course
of
the
day
running
through
the
Boulevards
the
Tuileries
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
and
the
Palais
Royal
and
even
ascending
the
Vendome
Column
he
dined
at
Vefeur
's
with
the
dignified
air
of
an
habitue
and
in
the
evening
visited
the
Chateau
des
Fleurs
to
see
as
a
disinterested
observer
what
the
can-can
really
was
like
and
how
the
Parisians
danced
it
The
dance
itself
Vyazov
nin
did
not
think
attractive
but
one
of
the
Parisiennes
performing
the
can-can
a
lively
well-made
brunette
with
a
turned-up
nose
and
III
saucy
eyes
did
attract
him
He
came
to
a
standstill
near
her
more
and
more
frequently
exchanged
at
first
glances
with
her
then
smiles
then
words
Half
an
hour
later
she
was
walking
arm
in
arm
with
him
telling
him
son
petit
nom
Julie
and
hinting
that
she
was
hungry
and
that
nothing
could
be
better
than
a
supper
at
the
Maison
d'Or
dans
un
petit
cab
inet
particulier
Boris
Andreyitch
was
not
at
all
hungry
him
self
and
indeed
supper
in
the
society
of
Mdlle
Julie
had
not
entered
into
his
calculations
However
if
that
's
the
way
here
he
thought
I
suppose
I
shall
have
to
go
Par
tons
he
said
aloud
but
at
the
same
instant
someone
trod
very
heavily
on
his
foot
He
cried
out
turned
round
and
saw
facing
him
a
thick-set
broad-shouldered
middle-aged
gentle
man
in
a
stiff
cravat
in
the
frock-coat
of
a
ci
vilian
buttoned
all
the
way
up
and
full
trousers
of
military
cut
Pulling
his
hat
right
down
to
his
nose
from
under
which
his
dyed
moustaches
fell
in
two
little
cascades
and
bulging
out
his
trousers
pockets
with
the
big
fingers
of
his
hairy
hands
this
gentleman
by
every
token
an
infantry
officer
stared
stubbornly
at
Vyazovnin
The
expression
of
his
yellow
eyes
of
his
rough
flat
cheeks
of
his
bluish
prominent
jaws
of
his
whole
face
was
coarse
and
insolent
Was
it
you
trod
on
my
foot
said
Vyazov
nin
Out
Monsieur
But
in
such
cases
people
apologise
And
if
I
wo
n't
apologise
to
you
Monsieur
le
MoscoiAte
Parisians
recognise
Russians
at
once
Then
did
you
wish
to
insult
me
asked
Vyazovnin
Oui
Monsieur
I
do
n't
like
the
shape
of
your
nose
Fi
Le
gros
jaloux
murmured
Mdlle
Julie
to
whom
the
infantry
officer
was
evi
dently
not
a
stranger
But
then
Vyazovnin
began
as
though
bewildered
Then
we
must
fight
the
officer
caught
him
up
Of
course
Very
good
Here
is
my
card
And
here
is
mine
answered
Vyazovnin
still
bewildered
and
as
though
in
a
dream
with
a
confused
throbbing
of
his
heart
he
scribbled
on
the
polished
paper
of
his
visiting
card
with
a
little
gold
pencil
he
had
just
bought
for
his
watch
chain
Hotel
des
Trots
Monarques
No
The
officer
nodded
and
announced
that
he
would
have
the
honour
of
sending
his
seconds
to
Monsieur
Monsieur
he
raised
Vyazovnin
's
card
to
his
right
eye
Monsieur
de
Vazavononin
and
turned
his
back
on
Boris
Andreyitch
who
at
once
left
the
Chateau
des
Fleurs
Mdlle
Julie
tried
to
detain
him
but
he
looked
at
her
very
coldly
she
promptly
turned
away
from
him
and
was
for
a
long
time
afterwards
sitting
by
the
wall
explaining
some
thing
to
the
angry
officer
who
as
before
kept
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
did
not
smile
On
getting
into
the
street
Vyazovnin
stopped
under
the
first
gas
lamp
he
came
to
and
for
a
second
time
and
with
great
attention
read
the
card
that
had
been
handed
him
On
it
stood
the
following
words
Alexandre
Lebccuf
capiiaine
en
second
au
Ssme
de
Lignc
Is
it
possible
that
this
can
lead
to
any
thing
he
thought
to
himself
Can
I
really
be
going
to
fight
a
duel
And
what
for
And
on
the
very
day
after
my
arrival
in
Paris
What
folly
He
began
a
letter
to
Verotchka
to
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
and
at
once
tore
up
the
pages
he
had
begun
and
flung
them
away
Nonsense
It
's
a
farce
he
repeated
and
went
to
bed
But
his
thoughts
took
a
different
turn
when
next
morning
at
breakfast
two
gentlemen
very
much
like
Monsieur
Lebceuf
only
younger
all
French
infantry
officers
have
the
same
face
called
upon
him
and
announcing
their
names
one
was
called
Monsieur
LeCoq
the
other
Monsieur
Pinochet
both
were
lieutenants
au
me
de
Ligne
introduced
themselves
to
Boris
Andreyitch
as
the
seconds
de
notre
ami
Monsieur
Lebceuf
sent
by
him
to
take
all
nec
essary
steps
since
their
friend
Monsieur
Le
boeuf
would
accept
no
apologies
5
Vyazovnin
was
obliged
to
inform
Messieurs
les
ofRciers
the
friends
of
Monsieur
Leboeuf
that
being
a
complete
novice
in
Paris
he
had
not
yet
had
time
to
look
round
and
provide
him
self
with
a
second
I
suppose
one
is
enough
he
added
Quite
enough
responded
Mon
sieur
Pinochet
and
therefore
he
would
have
to
ask
Messieurs
les
ofdciers
to
let
him
have
four
hours
to
find
one
Messieurs
les
ofhciers
exchanged
glances
shrugged
their
shoulders
consented
however
and
got
up
from
their
seats
Si
Mofisieur
le
desire
Monsieur
Pinochet
brought
out
suddenly
stopping
short
before
the
door
of
the
two
seconds
he
was
obviously
the
readier
with
his
tongue
and
he
had
been
commissioned
to
carry
on
the
negotiations
Monsieur
LeCoq
merely
grunted
approvingly
Si
Monsieur
le
desire
he
repeated
Vyazov
nin
was
reminded
of
Monsieur
Galisi
his
Mos
cow
barber
who
often
made
use
of
that
phrase
we
can
recommend
one
of
the
offi
cers
of
our
regiment
le
lieutenant
Barbichon
un
gargon
tres
devoue
who
would
certainly
consent
to
do
a
service
a
un
gentleman
Mon
Ii6
sieur
Pinochet
pronounced
this
word
as
if
it
were
French
to
help
him
out
of
a
difficulty
and
if
he
becomes
your
second
he
will
take
your
interests
to
heart
prendre
a
cccur
vos
interets
Vyazovnin
was
at
first
amazed
at
such
a
pro
posal
but
reflecting
that
he
knew
no
one
in
Paris
thanked
Monsieur
Pinochet
and
said
he
would
expect
Monsieur
Barbichon
and
Mon
sieur
Barbichon
was
not
slow
in
making
his
appearance
This
gargon
rcs
devoue
turned
out
to
be
an
extremely
alert
and
active
person
declaring
that
cet
animal
de
Lebmif
n'en
fait
jamais
d'autres
c'est
un
Othello
Monsieur
tin
veritable
Othello
He
asked
Vyazovnin
N'est-cc
pas
que
voiis
desires
que
I
affaire
soit
serieuse
And
without
waiting
for
an
an
swer
exclaimed
C'est
tout
ce
que
je
desirais
savoir
Laisses
moi
f
aire
I
And
he
did
in
fact
conduct
the
affair
with
such
energy
and
took
Vyazovnin's
interests
to
heart
with
such
warmth
that
four
hours
later
poor
Boris
Andreyitch
who
had
no
notion
of
fencing
was
standing
in
the
very
middle
of
a
green
glade
in
the
Bois
de
Vin
cennes
with
his
coat
off
and
the
sleeves
of
his
shirt
tucked
up
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
two
paces
from
his
opponent
Bright
sunshine
lighted
up
the
scene
Vyazovnin
had
no
clear
idea
of
how
he
had
come
there
he
kept
re
peating
to
himself
How
stupid
it
is
How
stupid
it
is
And
he
felt
ashamed
as
though
he
were
taking
part
in
some
dull
practical
joke
and
an
awkward
inwardly
hidden
grin
played
about
his
soul
while
his
eyes
were
riv
etted
on
the
low
brow
and
the
cropped
black
hair
of
the
Frenchman
who
stood
before
him
Tout
est
pret
a
lisping
voice
announced
Allez
piped
another
Monsieur
Lebceuf
's
face
assumed
an
expres
sion
not
so
much
ferocious
as
predatory
Vyazovnin
flourished
his
sword
Pinochet
had
assured
him
that
his
ignorance
of
the
art
of
fencing
gave
him
de
grands
avantages
when
all
at
once
something
extraordinary
hap
pened
There
was
a
rattle
a
stamp
a
flash
Vyazovnin
felt
in
his
chest
on
the
right
side
the
presence
of
a
sort
of
cold
big
stick
He
wanted
to
push
it
away
to
say
Do
n't
but
he
was
already
lying
on
his
back
and
experi
ii8
encing
a
strange
almost
absurd
sensation
as
though
they
were
trying
to
pull
teeth
out
of
his
whole
body
Then
the
earth
began
softly
heaving
under
him
A
voice
said
Tout
c'est
passe
dans
les
regies
n'est-ce
pas
Messienrs
A
second
answered
Oh
par
faitement
And
crash
Everything
seemed
to
fly
round
and
then
sank
into
the
earth
Verotchka
Vyazovnin
hardly
had
time
to
think
with
anguish
Towards
evening
the
gargon
tres
devoue
brought
him
to
the
hotel
des
trois
Monarques
He
died
in
the
night
He
passed
away
to
that
land
from
which
no
traveller
has
yet
returned
He
did
not
regain
consciousness
before
his
death
and
only
muttered
twice
I
'll
go
back
directly
it
's
nothing
to
the
country
now
The
Russian
priest
for
whom
the
hotel-keeper
sent
gave
information
of
all
this
to
the
Russian
embassy
and
two
days
later
the
unhappy
affair
with
a
Russian
visitor
was
in
all
the
newspapers
It
had
been
a
hard
and
bitter
task
for
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
to
tell
Verotchka
of
her
husband's
letter
but
when
the
news
of
Vyazovnin
's
death
reached
him
he
was
utterly
distracted
The
first
to
read
of
it
in
the
papers
was
Mihey
Miheyitch
and
he
at
once
galloped
off
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
accompanied
by
Onufry
Ilyitch
with
whom
he
had
again
made
friends
As
people
usually
do
he
began
shouting
as
soon
as
he
got
into
the
hall
Only
fancy
What
a
disaster
and
so
on
For
a
long
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
not
believe
him
but
when
no
possibility
of
doubt
was
left
him
he
waited
a
whole
day
then
set
off
at
last
to
Verotchka
The
mere
sight
of
him
crushed
and
broken
so
alarmed
her
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
on
her
feet
He
tried
to
prepare
her
for
the
fatal
news
but
his
strength
failed
him
he
sat
down
and
through
his
tears
faltered
He
is
dead
he
is
dead
A
year
has
passed
From
the
roots
of
the
felled
tree
new
shoots
spring
up
the
deepest
wound
is
healed
in
time
life
replaces
death
even
as
it
is
replaced
by
it
and
Verotchka's
heart
had
gradually
grown
easier
and
begun
to
heal
Moreover
Vyazovnin
did
not
belong
to
the
number
of
people
who
are
irreplaceable
And
indeed
are
there
such
people
Nor
was
Ve
rotchka
capable
of
devoting
herself
for
ever
to
one
feeling
And
indeed
are
there
such
feelings
She
had
married
Vyazovnin
without
con
straint
and
without
great
enthusiasm
She
had
been
faithful
and
devoted
to
him
but
she
had
not
been
entirely
absorbed
in
him
She
grieved
for
him
genuinely
but
not
frantically
What
more
would
you
have
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
did
not
give
up
coming
to
see
her
he
was
as
before
her
closest
friend
and
so
it
was
not
at
all
surprising
that
being
left
one
day
alone
with
her
he
looked
into
her
face
and
very
quietly
suggested
that
she
should
be
his
wife
She
smiled
in
answer
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
Their
life
after
their
marriage
went
on
much
as
before
There
was
no
need
to
change
it
Ten
years
have
passed
since
then
Old
Barsukov
is
living
with
them
and
grows
younger
every
year
He
is
never
many
steps
apart
from
his
grandchildren
of
which
there
are
three
already
two
girls
and
a
boy
He
even
talks
to
them
especially
to
his
favourite
the
dark-eyed
curly-headed
boy
who
has
been
named
in
his
honour
Stepan
The
little
rogue
is
very
well
aware
that
his
grandfather
adores
him
and
so
ventures
upon
mimicking
how
he
walks
about
the
room
exclaiming
Bra-oo
Bra-oo
This
bit
of
mischief
always
excites
the
greatest
merriment
in
the
house
Poor
Vyazovnin
is
not
forgotten
to
this
day
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
honours
his
memory
always
speaks
of
him
with
peculiar
feeling
and
at
every
op
portunity
is
sure
to
say
that
the
dear
fellow
was
fond
of
this
or
had
the
habit
of
doing
that
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
his
Wife
and
all
his
household
lead
a
very
monotonous
life
quiet
and
peaceful
they
are
happy
for
there
is
no
other
happiness
on
earth
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
Twenty
years
ago
it
was
my
lot
to
make
an
unofficial
tour
of
inspection
of
the
rather
numerous
estates
belonging
to
my
aunt
The
parish
priests
with
whom
I
considered
it
my
duty
to
make
acquaintance
turned
out
all
to
be
rather
alike
aiid
seemed
as
though
they
had
all
been
made
on
the
same
pattern
but
finally
in
almost
the
last
estate
that
I
inspected
I
found
a
priest
who
was
unlike
the
others
He
was
a
very
old
almost
decrepit
man
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
earnest
entreaties
of
his
parishioners
who
loved
and
respected
him
he
would
long
before
have
asked
to
be
relieved
of
his
duties
I
was
struck
by
two
peculiarities
in
Father
Alexey
that
was
the
priest's
name
To
begin
with
he
not
merely
re
frained
from
asking
anything
for
himself
but
declared
in
so
many
words
that
he
needed
noth
ing
and
in
the
second
place
I
had
never
seen
in
any
human
face
such
