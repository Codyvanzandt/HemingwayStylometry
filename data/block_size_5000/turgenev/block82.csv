throat
Very
well
very
well
my
mother
made
haste
to
soothe
him
only
I
don
t
understand
all
the
same
what
has
put
it
into
your
head
to
divide
the
property
up
now
It
would
have
come
to
them
afterwards
in
any
case
I
imagine
it
s
your
melancholy
that
s
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
Eh
ma
am
Harlov
rejoined
not
without
vexation
you
will
keep
coming
back
to
that
There
is
maybe
a
higher
power
at
work
in
this
and
you
talk
of
melancholy
I
thought
to
do
this
madam
because
in
my
own
person
while
still
in
life
I
wish
to
decide
in
my
presence
who
is
to
possess
what
and
with
what
I
will
reward
each
so
that
they
may
possess
and
feel
thankfulness
and
carry
out
my
wishes
and
what
their
father
and
benefactor
has
resolved
upon
they
may
accept
as
a
bountiful
gift
Harlov
s
voice
broke
again
Come
that
s
enough
that
s
enough
my
good
friend
my
mother
cut
him
short
or
your
raven
colt
will
be
putting
in
an
appearance
in
earnest
O
Natalia
Nikolaevna
don
t
talk
to
me
of
it
groaned
Harlov
That
s
my
death
come
after
me
Forgive
my
intrusion
And
you
my
little
sir
I
shall
have
the
honour
of
expecting
you
the
day
after
to-morrow
Martin
Petrovitch
went
out
my
mother
looked
after
him
and
shook
her
head
significantly
This
is
a
bad
business
she
murmured
a
bad
business
You
noticed
she
addressed
herself
to
me
he
talked
and
all
the
while
seemed
blinking
as
though
the
sun
were
in
his
eyes
that
s
a
bad
sign
When
a
man
s
like
that
his
heart
s
sure
to
be
heavy
and
misfortune
threatens
him
You
must
go
over
the
day
after
to-morrow
with
Vikenty
Osipovitch
and
Souvenir
On
the
day
appointed
our
big
family
coach
with
seats
for
four
harnessed
with
six
bay
horses
and
with
the
head
coachman
the
grey-bearded
and
portly
Alexeitch
on
the
box
rolled
smoothly
up
to
the
steps
of
our
house
The
importance
of
the
act
upon
which
Harlov
was
about
to
enter
and
the
solemnity
with
which
he
had
invited
us
had
had
their
effect
on
my
mother
She
had
herself
given
orders
for
this
extraordinary
state
equipage
to
be
brought
out
and
had
directed
Souvenir
and
me
to
put
on
our
best
clothes
She
obviously
wished
to
show
respect
to
her
prot
g
As
for
Kvitsinsky
he
always
wore
a
frock-coat
and
white
tie
Souvenir
chattered
like
a
magpie
all
the
way
giggled
wondered
whether
his
brother
would
apportion
him
anything
and
thereupon
called
him
a
dummy
and
an
old
fogey
Kvitsinsky
a
man
of
severe
and
bilious
temperament
could
not
put
up
with
it
at
last
What
can
induce
you
he
observed
in
his
distinct
Polish
accent
to
keep
up
such
a
continual
unseemly
chatter
Can
you
really
be
incapable
of
sitting
quiet
without
these
wholly
superfluous
his
favourite
phrase
inanities
All
right
d
rectly
Souvenir
muttered
discontentedly
and
he
fixed
his
squinting
eyes
on
the
carriage
window
A
quarter
of
an
hour
had
not
passed
the
smoothly
trotting
horses
had
scarcely
begun
to
get
warm
under
the
straps
of
their
new
harness
when
Harlov
s
homestead
came
into
sight
Through
the
widely
open
gate
our
coach
rolled
into
the
yard
The
diminutive
postillion
whose
legs
hardly
reached
half-way
down
his
horses
body
for
the
last
time
leaped
up
with
a
babyish
shriek
into
the
soft
saddle
old
Alexeitch
at
once
spread
out
and
raised
his
elbows
a
slight
wo-o
was
heard
and
we
stopped
The
dogs
did
not
bark
to
greet
us
and
the
serf
boys
in
long
smocks
that
gaped
open
over
their
big
stomachs
had
all
hidden
themselves
Harlov
s
son-in-law
was
awaiting
us
in
the
doorway
I
remember
I
was
particularly
struck
by
the
birch
boughs
stuck
in
on
both
sides
of
the
steps
as
though
it
were
Trinity
Sunday
Grandeur
upon
grandeur
Souvenir
who
was
the
first
to
alight
squeaked
through
his
nose
And
certainly
there
was
a
solemn
air
about
everything
Harlov
s
son-in-law
was
wearing
a
plush
cravat
with
a
satin
bow
and
an
extraordinarily
tight
tail-coat
while
Maximka
who
popped
out
behind
his
back
had
his
hair
so
saturated
with
kvas
that
it
positively
dripped
We
went
into
the
parlour
and
saw
Martin
Petrovitch
towering
yes
positively
towering
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
room
I
don
t
know
what
Souvenir
s
and
Kvitsinsky
s
feelings
were
at
the
sight
of
his
colossal
figure
but
I
felt
something
akin
to
awe
Martin
Petrovitch
was
attired
in
a
grey
Cossack
coat
his
militia
uniform
of
1812
it
must
have
been
with
a
black
stand-up
collar
A
bronze
medal
was
to
be
seen
on
his
breast
a
sabre
hung
at
his
side
he
laid
his
left
hand
on
the
hilt
with
his
right
he
was
leaning
on
the
table
which
was
covered
with
a
red
cloth
Two
sheets
of
paper
full
of
writing
lay
on
the
table
Harlov
stood
motionless
not
even
gasping
and
what
dignity
was
expressed
in
his
attitude
what
confidence
in
himself
in
his
unlimited
and
unquestionable
power
He
barely
greeted
us
with
a
motion
of
the
head
and
barely
articulating
Be
seated
pointed
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
in
the
direction
of
some
chairs
set
in
a
row
Against
the
right-hand
wall
of
the
parlour
were
standing
Harlov
s
daughters
wearing
their
Sunday
clothes
Anna
in
a
shot
lilac-green
dress
with
a
yellow
silk
sash
Evlampia
in
pink
with
crimson
ribbons
Near
them
stood
Zhitkov
in
a
new
uniform
with
the
habitual
expression
of
dull
and
greedy
expectation
in
his
eyes
and
with
a
greater
profusion
of
sweat
than
usual
over
his
hirsute
countenance
On
the
left
side
of
the
room
sat
the
priest
in
a
threadbare
snuff-coloured
cassock
an
old
man
with
rough
brown
hair
This
head
of
hair
and
the
dejected
lack-lustre
eyes
and
the
big
wrinkled
hands
which
seemed
a
burden
even
to
himself
and
lay
like
two
rocks
on
his
knees
and
the
tarred
boots
which
peeped
out
beneath
his
cassock
all
seemed
to
tell
of
a
joyless
laborious
life
His
parish
was
a
very
poor
one
Beside
him
was
the
local
police
captain
a
fattish
palish
dirty-looking
little
gentleman
with
soft
puffy
little
hands
and
feet
black
eyes
black
short-clipped
moustaches
a
continual
cheerful
but
yet
sickly
little
smile
on
his
face
He
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
great
taker
of
bribes
and
even
a
tyrant
as
the
expression
was
in
those
days
But
not
only
the
gentry
even
the
peasants
were
used
to
him
and
liked
him
He
bent
very
free
and
easy
and
rather
ironical
looks
around
him
it
was
clear
that
all
this
procedure
amused
him
In
reality
the
only
part
that
had
any
interest
for
him
was
the
light
lunch
and
spirits
in
store
for
us
But
the
attorney
sitting
near
him
a
lean
man
with
a
long
face
narrow
whiskers
from
his
ears
to
his
nose
as
they
were
worn
in
the
days
of
Alexander
the
First
was
absorbed
with
his
whole
soul
in
Martin
Petrovitch
s
proceedings
and
never
took
his
big
serious
eyes
off
him
In
his
concentrated
attention
and
sympathy
he
kept
moving
and
twisting
his
lips
though
without
opening
his
mouth
Souvenir
stationed
himself
next
him
and
began
talking
to
him
in
a
whisper
after
first
informing
me
that
he
was
the
chief
freemason
in
the
province
The
temporary
division
of
the
local
court
consists
as
every
one
knows
of
the
police
captain
the
attorney
and
the
rural
police
commissioner
but
the
latter
was
either
absent
or
kept
himself
in
the
background
so
that
I
did
not
notice
him
He
bore
however
the
nickname
the
non-existent
among
us
in
the
district
just
as
there
are
tramps
called
the
non-identified
I
sat
next
Souvenir
Kvitsinsky
next
me
The
face
of
the
practical
Pole
showed
unmistakeable
annoyance
at
our
wholly
superfluous
expedition
and
unnecessary
waste
of
time
A
grand
lady
s
caprices
these
Russian
grandees
fancies
he
seemed
to
be
murmuring
to
himself
Ugh
these
Russians
When
we
were
all
seated
Martin
Petrovitch
hunched
his
shoulders
cleared
his
throat
scanned
us
all
with
his
bear-like
little
eyes
and
with
a
noisy
sigh
began
as
follows
Gentlemen
I
have
called
you
together
for
the
following
purpose
I
am
grown
old
gentlemen
and
overcome
by
infirmities
Already
I
have
had
an
intimation
the
hour
of
death
steals
on
like
a
thief
in
the
night
Isn
t
that
so
father
he
addressed
the
priest
The
priest
started
Quite
so
quite
so
he
mumbled
his
beard
shaking
And
therefore
continued
Martin
Petrovitch
suddenly
raising
his
voice
not
wishing
the
said
death
to
come
upon
me
unawares
I
purposed
Martin
Petrovitch
proceeded
to
repeat
word
for
word
the
speech
he
had
made
to
my
mother
two
days
before
In
accordance
with
this
my
determination
he
shouted
louder
than
ever
this
deed
he
struck
his
hand
on
the
papers
lying
on
the
table
has
been
drawn
up
by
me
and
the
presiding
authorities
have
been
invited
by
me
and
wherein
my
will
consists
the
following
points
will
treat
I
have
ruled
my
day
is
over
Martin
Petrovitch
put
his
round
iron
spectacles
on
his
nose
took
one
of
the
written
sheets
from
the
table
and
began
Deed
of
partition
of
the
estate
of
the
retired
non-commissioned
officer
and
nobleman
Martin
Harlov
drawn
up
by
himself
in
his
full
and
right
understanding
and
by
his
own
good
judgment
and
wherein
is
precisely
defined
what
benefits
are
assigned
to
his
two
daughters
Anna
and
Evlampia
bow
they
bowed
and
in
what
way
the
serfs
and
other
property
and
live
stock
be
apportioned
between
the
said
daughters
Under
my
hand
This
is
their
document
the
police
captain
whispered
to
Kvitsinsky
with
his
invariable
smile
they
want
to
read
it
for
the
beauty
of
the
style
but
the
legal
deed
is
made
out
formally
without
all
these
flourishes
Souvenir
was
beginning
to
snigger
In
accordance
with
my
will
put
in
Harlov
who
had
caught
the
police
captain
s
remark
In
accordance
in
every
point
the
latter
hastened
to
respond
cheerfully
only
as
you
re
aware
Martin
Petrovitch
there
s
no
dispensing
with
formality
And
unnecessary
details
have
been
removed
For
the
chamber
can
t
enter
into
the
question
of
spotted
cows
and
fancy
drakes
Come
here
boomed
Harlov
to
his
son-in-law
who
had
come
into
the
room
behind
us
and
remained
standing
with
an
obsequious
air
near
the
door
He
skipped
up
to
his
father-in-law
at
once
There
take
it
and
read
It
s
hard
for
me
Only
mind
and
don
t
mumble
it
Let
all
the
gentlemen
present
be
able
to
understand
it
Sletkin
took
the
paper
in
both
hands
and
began
timidly
but
distinctly
and
with
taste
and
feeling
to
read
the
deed
of
partition
There
was
set
forth
in
it
with
the
greatest
accuracy
just
what
was
assigned
to
Anna
and
what
to
Evlampia
and
how
the
division
was
to
be
made
Harlov
from
time
to
time
interspersed
the
reading
with
phrases
Do
you
hear
that
s
for
you
Anna
for
your
zeal
or
That
I
give
you
Evlampia
and
both
the
sisters
bowed
Anna
from
the
waist
Evlampia
simply
with
a
motion
of
the
head
Harlov
looked
at
them
with
stern
dignity
The
farm
house
the
little
new
building
was
assigned
by
him
to
Evlampia
as
the
younger
daughter
by
the
well-known
custom
The
reader
s
voice
quivered
and
resounded
at
these
words
unfavourable
for
himself
while
Zhitkov
licked
his
lips
Evlampia
gave
him
a
sidelong
glance
had
I
been
in
Zhitkov
s
shoes
I
should
not
have
liked
that
glance
The
scornful
expression
characteristic
of
Evlampia
as
of
every
genuine
Russian
beauty
had
a
peculiar
shade
at
that
moment
For
himself
Martin
Petrovitch
reserved
the
right
to
go
on
living
in
the
rooms
he
occupied
and
assigned
to
himself
under
the
name
of
rations
a
full
allowance
of
normal
provisions
and
ten
roubles
a
month
for
clothes
The
last
phrase
of
the
deed
Harlov
wished
to
read
himself
And
this
my
parental
will
it
ran
to
carry
out
and
observe
is
a
sacred
and
binding
duty
on
my
daughters
seeing
it
is
a
command
seeing
that
I
am
after
God
their
father
and
head
and
am
not
bounden
to
render
an
account
to
any
nor
have
so
rendered
And
do
they
carry
out
my
will
so
will
my
fatherly
blessing
be
with
them
but
should
they
not
so
do
which
God
forbid
then
will
they
be
overtaken
by
my
paternal
curse
that
can
not
be
averted
now
and
for
ever
amen
Harlov
raised
the
deed
high
above
his
head
Anna
at
once
dropped
on
her
knees
and
touched
the
ground
with
her
forehead
her
husband
too
doubled
up
after
her
Well
and
you
Harlov
turned
to
Evlampia
She
crimsoned
all
over
and
she
too
bowed
to
the
earth
Zhitkov
bent
his
whole
carcase
forward
Sign
cried
Harlov
pointing
his
forefinger
to
the
bottom
of
the
deed
Here
I
thank
and
accept
Anna
I
thank
and
accept
Evlampia
Both
daughters
rose
and
signed
one
after
another
Sletkin
rose
too
and
was
feeling
after
the
pen
but
Harlov
moved
him
aside
sticking
his
middle
finger
into
his
cravat
so
that
he
gasped
The
silence
lasted
a
moment
Suddenly
Martin
Petrovitch
gave
a
sort
of
sob
and
muttering
Well
now
it
s
all
yours
moved
away
His
daughters
and
son-in-law
looked
at
one
another
went
up
to
him
and
began
kissing
him
just
above
his
elbow
His
shoulder
they
could
not
reach
The
police
captain
read
the
real
formal
document
the
deed
of
gift
drawn
up
by
Martin
Petrovitch
Then
he
went
out
on
to
the
steps
with
the
attorney
and
explained
what
had
taken
place
to
the
crowd
assembled
at
the
gates
consisting
of
the
witnesses
required
by
law
and
other
people
from
the
neighbourhood
Harlov
s
peasants
and
a
few
house-serfs
Then
began
the
ceremony
of
the
new
owners
entering
into
possession
They
came
out
too
upon
the
steps
and
the
police
captain
pointed
to
them
when
slightly
scowling
with
one
eyebrow
while
his
careless
face
assumed
for
an
instant
a
threatening
air
he
exhorted
the
crowd
to
subordination
He
might
well
have
dispensed
with
these
exhortations
a
less
unruly
set
of
countenances
than
those
of
the
Harlov
peasants
I
imagine
have
never
existed
in
creation
Clothed
in
thin
smocks
and
torn
sheepskins
but
very
tightly
girt
round
their
waists
as
is
always
the
peasants
way
on
solemn
occasions
they
stood
motionless
as
though
cut
out
of
stone
and
whenever
the
police
captain
uttered
any
exclamation
such
as
D
ye
hear
you
brutes
d
ye
understand
you
devils
they
suddenly
bowed
all
at
once
as
though
at
the
word
of
command
Each
of
these
brutes
and
devils
held
his
cap
tight
in
both
hands
and
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
window
where
Martin
Petrovitch
s
figure
was
visible
The
witnesses
themselves
were
hardly
less
awed
Is
any
impediment
known
to
you
the
police
captain
roared
at
them
against
the
entrance
into
possession
of
these
the
sole
and
legitimate
heirs
and
daughters
of
Martin
Petrovitch
Harlov
All
the
witnesses
seemed
to
huddle
together
at
once
Do
you
know
any
you
devils
the
police
captain
shouted
again
We
know
nothing
your
excellency
responded
sturdily
a
little
old
man
marked
with
small-pox
with
a
clipped
beard
and
whiskers
an
old
soldier
I
say
Eremeitch
s
a
bold
fellow
the
witnesses
said
of
him
as
they
dispersed
In
spite
of
the
police
captain
s
entreaties
Harlov
would
not
come
out
with
his
daughters
on
to
the
steps
My
subjects
will
obey
my
will
without
that
he
answered
Something
like
sadness
had
come
over
him
on
the
completion
of
the
conveyance
His
face
had
grown
pale
This
new
unprecedented
expression
of
sadness
looked
so
out
of
place
on
Martin
Petrovitch
s
broad
and
kindly
features
that
I
positively
was
at
a
loss
what
to
think
Was
an
attack
of
melancholy
coming
over
him
The
peasants
on
their
side
too
were
obviously
puzzled
And
no
wonder
The
master
s
alive
there
he
stands
and
such
a
master
too
Martin
Petrovitch
And
all
of
a
sudden
he
won
t
be
their
owner
A
queer
thing
I
don
t
know
whether
Harlov
had
an
inkling
of
the
notions
that
were
straying
through
his
subjects
heads
or
whether
he
wanted
to
display
his
power
for
the
last
time
but
he
suddenly
opened
the
little
window
stuck
his
head
out
and
shouted
in
a
voice
of
thunder
obedience
Then
he
slammed-to
the
window
The
peasants
bewilderment
was
certainly
not
dispelled
nor
decreased
by
this
proceeding
They
became
stonier
than
ever
and
even
seemed
to
cease
looking
at
anything
The
group
of
house-serfs
among
them
were
two
sturdy
wenches
in
short
chintz
gowns
with
muscles
such
as
one
might
perhaps
match
in
Michael
Angelo
s
Last
Judgment
and
one
utterly
decrepit
old
man
hoary
with
age
and
half
blind
in
a
threadbare
frieze
cloak
rumoured
to
have
been
cornet-player
in
the
days
of
Potemkin
the
page
Maximka
Harlov
had
reserved
for
himself
this
group
showed
more
life
than
the
peasants
at
least
it
moved
restlessly
about
The
new
mistresses
themselves
were
very
dignified
in
their
attitude
especially
Anna
Her
thin
lips
tightly
compressed
she
looked
obstinately
down
her
stern
figure
augured
little
good
to
the
house-serfs
Evlampia
too
did
not
raise
her
eyes
only
once
she
turned
round
and
deliberately
as
it
were
with
surprise
scanned
her
betrothed
Zhitkov
who
had
thought
fit
following
Sletkin
to
come
out
too
on
to
the
steps
What
business
have
you
here
those
handsome
prominent
eyes
seemed
to
demand
Sletkin
was
the
most
changed
of
all
A
bustling
cheeriness
showed
itself
in
his
whole
bearing
as
though
he
were
overtaken
by
hunger
the
movements
of
his
head
and
his
legs
were
as
obsequious
as
ever
but
how
gleefully
he
kept
working
his
arms
how
fussily
he
twitched
his
shoulder-blades
Arrived
at
last
he
seemed
to
say
Having
finished
the
ceremony
of
the
entrance
into
possession
the
police
captain
whose
mouth
was
literally
watering
at
the
prospect
of
lunch
rubbed
his
hands
in
that
peculiar
manner
which
usually
precedes
the
tossing-off
of
the
first
glass
of
spirits
But
it
appeared
that
Martin
Petrovitch
wished
first
to
have
a
service
performed
with
sprinklings
of
holy
water
The
priest
put
on
an
ancient
and
decrepit
chasuble
a
decrepit
deacon
came
out
of
the
kitchen
with
difficulty
kindling
the
incense
in
an
old
brazen
church-vessel
The
service
began
Harlov
sighed
continually
he
was
unable
owing
to
his
corpulence
to
bow
to
the
ground
but
crossing
himself
with
his
right
hand
and
bending
his
head
he
pointed
with
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
to
the
floor
Sletkin
positively
beamed
and
even
shed
tears
Zhitkov
with
dignity
in
martial
fashion
flourished
his
fingers
only
slightly
between
the
third
and
fourth
button
of
his
uniform
Kvitsinsky
as
a
Catholic
remained
in
the
next
room
But
the
attorney
prayed
so
fervently
sighed
so
sympathetically
after
Martin
Petrovitch
and
so
persistently
muttered
and
chewed
his
lips
turning
his
eyes
upwards
that
I
felt
moved
as
I
looked
at
him
and
began
to
pray
fervently
too
At
the
conclusion
of
the
service
and
the
sprinkling
with
holy
water
during
which
every
one
present
even
the
blind
cornet-player
the
contemporary
of
Potemkin
even
Kvitsinsky
moistened
their
eyes
with
holy
water
Anna
and
Evlampia
once
more
at
Martin
Petrovitch
s
bidding
prostrated
themselves
to
the
ground
to
thank
him
Then
at
last
came
the
moment
of
lunch
There
were
a
great
many
dishes
and
all
very
nice
we
all
ate
terribly
much
The
inevitable
bottle
of
Don
wine
made
its
appearance
The
police
captain
who
was
of
all
of
us
the
most
familiar
with
the
usages
of
the
world
and
besides
the
representative
of
government
was
the
first
to
propose
the
toast
to
the
health
of
the
fair
proprietresses
Then
he
proposed
we
should
drink
to
the
health
of
our
most
honoured
and
most
generous-hearted
friend
Martin
Petrovitch
At
the
words
most
generous-hearted
Sletkin
uttered
a
shrill
little
cry
and
ran
to
kiss
his
benefactor
There
that
ll
do
that
ll
do
muttered
Harlov
as
it
were
with
annoyance
keeping
him
off
with
his
elbow
But
at
this
point
a
not
quite
pleasant
as
they
say
incident
took
place
Souvenir
who
had
been
drinking
continuously
ever
since
the
beginning
of
luncheon
suddenly
got
up
from
his
chair
as
red
as
a
beetroot
and
pointing
his
finger
at
Martin
Petrovitch
went
off
into
his
mawkish
paltry
laugh
Generous-hearted
Generous-hearted
he
began
croaking
but
we
shall
see
whether
this
generosity
will
be
much
to
his
taste
when
he
s
stripped
naked
the
servant
of
God
and
out
in
the
snow
too
What
rot
are
you
talking
fool
said
Harlov
contemptuously
Fool
fool
repeated
Souvenir
God
Almighty
alone
knows
which
of
us
is
the
real
fool
But
you
brother
did
my
sister
your
wife
to
her
death
and
now
you
ve
done
for
yourself
ha-ha-ha
How
dare
you
insult
our
honoured
benefactor
Sletkin
began
shrilly
and
tearing
himself
away
from
Martin
Petrovitch
whose
shoulder
he
had
clutched
he
flew
at
Souvenir
But
let
me
tell
you
if
our
benefactor
desires
it
we
can
cancel
the
deed
this
very
minute
And
yet
you
ll
strip
him
naked
and
turn
him
out
into
the
snow
returned
Souvenir
retreating
behind
Kvitsinsky
Silence
thundered
Harlov
I
ll
pound
you
into
a
jelly
And
you
hold
your
tongue
too
puppy
he
turned
to
Sletkin
don
t
put
in
your
word
where
you
re
not
wanted
If
I
Martin
Petrovitch
Harlov
have
decided
to
make
a
deed
of
partition
who
can
cancel
the
same
act
against
my
will
Why
in
the
whole
world
there
is
no
power
Martin
Petrovitch
the
attorney
began
in
a
mellow
bass
he
too
had
drunk
a
good
deal
but
his
dignity
was
only
increased
thereby
but
how
if
the
gentleman
has
spoken
the
truth
You
have
done
a
generous
action
to
be
sure
but
how
if
God
forbid
in
reality
in
place
of
fitting
gratitude
some
affront
come
of
it
I
stole
a
glance
at
both
Martin
Petrovitch
s
daughters
Anna
s
eyes
were
simply
pinned
upon
the
speaker
and
a
face
more
spiteful
more
snake-like
and
more
beautiful
in
its
very
spite
I
had
certainly
never
seen
Evlampia
sat
turned
away
with
her
arms
folded
A
smile
more
scornful
than
ever
curved
her
full
rosy
lips
Harlov
got
up
from
his
chair
opened
his
mouth
but
apparently
his
tongue
failed
him
He
suddenly
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
so
that
everything
in
the
room
danced
and
rang
Father
Anna
said
hurriedly
they
do
not
know
us
and
that
is
why
they
judge
of
us
so
But
don
t
please
make
yourself
ill
You
are
angered
for
nothing
indeed
see
your
face
is
as
it
were
twisted
awry
Harlov
looked
towards
Evlampia
she
did
not
stir
though
Zhitkov
sitting
beside
her
gave
her
a
poke
in
the
side
Thank
you
my
daughter
Anna
said
Harlov
huskily
you
are
a
sensible
girl
I
rely
upon
you
and
on
your
husband
too
Sletkin
once
more
gave
vent
to
a
shrill
little
sound
Zhitkov
expanded
his
chest
and
gave
a
little
scrape
with
his
foot
but
Harlov
did
not
observe
his
efforts
This
dolt
he
went
on
with
a
motion
of
his
chin
in
the
direction
of
Souvenir
is
pleased
to
get
a
chance
to
teaze
me
but
you
my
dear
sir
he
addressed
himself
to
the
attorney
it
is
not
for
you
to
pass
judgment
on
Martin
Harlov
that
is
something
beyond
you
Though
you
are
a
man
in
official
position
your
words
are
most
foolish
Besides
the
deed
is
done
there
will
be
no
going
back
from
my
determination
Now
I
will
wish
you
good-day
I
am
going
away
I
am
no
longer
the
master
of
this
house
but
a
guest
in
it
Anna
do
you
do
your
best
but
I
will
go
to
my
own
room
Enough
Martin
Petrovitch
turned
his
back
on
us
and
without
adding
another
word
walked
deliberately
out
of
the
room
This
sudden
withdrawal
on
the
part
of
our
host
could
not
but
break
up
the
party
especially
as
the
two
hostesses
also
vanished
not
long
after
Sletkin
vainly
tried
to
keep
us
The
police
captain
did
not
fail
to
blame
the
attorney
for
his
uncalled-for
candour
Couldn
t
help
it
the
latter
responded
My
conscience
spoke
There
you
see
that
he
s
a
mason
Souvenir
whispered
to
me
Conscience
retorted
the
police
captain
We
know
all
about
your
conscience
I
suppose
it
s
in
your
pocket
just
the
same
as
it
is
with
us
sinners
The
priest
meanwhile
even
though
already
on
his
feet
foreseeing
the
speedy
termination
of
the
repast
lifted
mouthful
after
mouthful
to
his
mouth
without
a
pause
You
ve
got
a
fine
appetite
I
see
Sletkin
observed
to
him
sharply
Storing
up
for
the
future
the
priest
responded
with
a
meek
grimace
years
of
hunger
were
expressed
in
that
reply
The
carriages
rattled
up
and
we
separated
On
the
way
home
no
one
hindered
Souvenir
s
chatter
and
silly
tricks
as
Kvitsinsky
had
announced
that
he
was
sick
of
all
this
wholly
superfluous
unpleasantness
and
had
set
off
home
before
us
on
foot
In
his
place
Zhitkov
took
a
seat
in
our
coach
The
retired
major
wore
a
most
dissatisfied
expression
and
kept
twitching
his
moustaches
like
a
spider
Well
your
noble
Excellency
lisped
Souvenir
is
subordination
exploded
eh
Wait
a
bit
and
see
what
will
happen
They
ll
give
you
the
sack
too
Ah
a
poor
bridegroom
you
are
a
poor
bridegroom
an
unlucky
bridegroom
Souvenir
was
positively
beside
himself
while
poor
Zhitkov
could
do
nothing
but
twitch
his
moustaches
When
I
got
home
I
told
my
mother
all
I
had
seen
She
heard
me
to
the
end
and
shook
her
head
several
times
It
s
a
bad
business
was
her
comment
I
don
t
like
all
these
innovations
Next
day
Martin
Petrovitch
came
to
dinner
My
mother
congratulated
him
on
the
successful
conclusion
of
his
project
You
are
now
a
free
man
she
said
and
ought
to
feel
more
at
ease
More
at
ease
to
be
sure
madam
answered
Martin
Petrovitch
by
no
means
however
showing
in
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
really
was
more
at
ease
Now
I
can
meditate
upon
my
soul
and
make
ready
for
my
last
hour
as
I
ought
Well
queried
my
mother
and
do
the
shooting
pains
still
tingle
in
your
arms
Harlov
twice
clenched
and
unclenched
his
left
arm
They
do
madam
and
I
ve
something
else
to
tell
you
As
I
begin
to
drop
asleep
some
one
cries
in
my
head
Take
care
Take
care
That
s
nerves
observed
my
mother
and
she
began
speaking
of
the
previous
day
and
referred
to
certain
circumstances
which
had
attended
the
completion
of
the
deed
of
partition
To
be
sure
to
be
sure
Harlov
interrupted
her
there
was
something
of
the
sort
of
no
consequence
Only
there
s
something
I
would
tell
you
he
added
hesitating
I
was
not
disturbed
yesterday
by
Souvenir
s
silly
words
even
Mr
Attorney
though
he
s
no
fool
even
he
did
not
trouble
me
no
it
was
quite
another
person
disturbed
me
Here
Harlov
faltered
Who
asked
my
mother
Harlov
fastened
his
eyes
upon
her
Evlampia
Evlampia
Your
daughter
How
was
that
Upon
my
word
madam
she
was
like
a
stone
nothing
but
a
statue
Can
it
be
she
has
no
feeling
Her
sister
Anna
well
she
was
all
she
should
be
She
s
a
keen-witted
creature
But
Evlampia
why
I
d
shown
her
I
must
own
so
much
partiality
Can
it
be
she
s
no
feeling
for
me
It
s
clear
I
m
in
a
bad
way
it
s
clear
I
ve
a
feeling
that
I
m
not
long
for
this
world
since
I
make
over
everything
to
them
and
yet
she
s
like
a
stone
she
might
at
least
utter
a
sound
Bows
yes
she
bows
but
there
s
no
thankfulness
to
be
seen
There
give
over
observed
my
mother
we
ll
marry
her
to
Gavrila
Fedulitch
she
ll
soon
get
softer
in
his
hands
Martin
Petrovitch
once
more
looked
from
under
his
brows
at
my
mother
Well
there
s
Gavrila
Fedulitch
to
be
sure
You
have
confidence
in
him
then
madam
I
ve
confidence
in
him
Very
well
you
should
know
best
to
be
sure
But
Evlampia
let
me
tell
you
is
like
me
The
character
is
just
the
same
She
has
the
wild
Cossack
blood
and
her
heart
s
like
a
burning
coal
Why
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
ve
a
heart
like
that
my
dear
sir
Harlov
made
no
answer
A
brief
silence
followed
What
are
you
going
to
do
Martin
Petrovitch
my
mother
began
in
what
way
do
you
mean
to
set
about
saving
your
soul
now
Will
you
set
off
to
Mitrophan
or
to
Kiev
or
may
be
you
ll
go
to
the
Optin
desert
as
it
s
in
the
neighbourhood
There
they
do
say
there
s
a
holy
monk
appeared
Father
Makary
they
call
him
no
one
remembers
any
one
like
him
He
sees
right
through
all
sins
If
she
really
turns
out
an
ungrateful
daughter
Harlov
enunciated
in
a
husky
voice
then
it
would
be
better
for
me
I
believe
to
kill
her
with
my
own
hands
What
are
you
saying
Lord
have
mercy
on
you
cried
my
mother
Think
what
you
re
saying
There
see
what
a
pretty
pass
it
s
come
to
You
should
have
listened
to
me
the
other
day
when
you
came
to
consult
me
Now
here
you
ll
go
tormenting
yourself
instead
of
thinking
of
your
soul
You
ll
be
tormenting
yourself
and
all
to
no
purpose
Yes
Here
you
re
complaining
now
and
faint-hearted
