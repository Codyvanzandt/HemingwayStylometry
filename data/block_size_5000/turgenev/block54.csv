to
her
Stelt
chinsky
and
another
gentleman
in
blue
spec
tacles
Life
or
death
she
asked
in
French
Life
cried
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
I
don't
want
death
yet
Steltchinsky
bowed
and
led
her
off
The
gentleman
in
blue
spectacles
referred
to
as
death
led
off
the
daughter
of
the
house
Both
names
had
been
suggested
by
Steltchinsky
Tell
me
please
who
is
this
Mr
Steltchin
sky
Vladimir
Sergeitch
asked
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
as
soon
as
the
latter
came
back
to
her
seat
He
is
in
the
Governor
's
service
a
very
agreeable
young
man
He
does
not
belong
here
He
is
rather
a
coxcomb
but
that
's
in
their
blood
I
hope
you
have
not
had
any
dif
ficulties
with
him
about
the
mazurka
Not
the
slightest
Vladimir
Sergeitch
re
plied
with
some
hesitation
I
am
so
forgetful
You
ca
n't
imagine
I
ought
to
rejoice
in
your
f
orgetfulness
it
has
given
me
the
pleasure
of
dancing
with
you
this
evening
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
looked
at
him
slightly
screwing
up
her
eyes
Really
You
are
glad
to
dance
with
me
Vladimir
Sergeitch
responded
with
a
com
pliment
Little
by
little
he
began
talking
freely
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
was
always
very
charming
and
was
especially
so
that
eve
ning
Vladimir
Sergeitch
thought
her
delight
ful
The
thought
of
the
duel
next
day
work
ing
upon
his
nerves
gave
brilHance
and
live
liness
to
his
talk
under
the
influence
of
it
he
allowed
himself
some
exaggeration
in
the
ex
pression
of
his
feelings
Well
come
what
may
In
all
his
words
in
his
stifled
sighs
in
the
sudden
gloom
that
from
time
to
time
clouded
his
face
there
was
something
of
mys
tery
of
involuntary
sadness
and
picturesque
despair
He
unbent
at
last
so
far
as
to
be
talking
of
love
of
women
of
his
future
of
his
conception
of
happiness
and
of
what
he
asked
of
fate
He
expressed
himself
in
directly
in
hints
On
the
eve
of
possible
death
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Vladimir
Sergeitch
flirted
with
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
She
listened
to
him
attentively
laughed
shook
her
head
sometimes
disputed
with
him
some
times
pretended
to
be
incredulous
The
conversation
frequently
interrupted
by
the
other
dances
took
at
last
a
rather
strange
turn
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
questioning
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
about
herself
about
her
character
about
her
tastes
At
first
she
turned
off
his
questions
with
a
jest
then
sud
denly
to
his
surprise
asked
him
when
he
was
going
away
Where
he
asked
wondering
Home
To
Sasovo
No
home
to
your
estate
seventy
miles
away
Vladimir
Sergeitch
dropped
his
eyes
I
should
like
it
to
be
as
soon
as
possible
he
brought
out
with
a
troubled
face
I
ex
pect
to-morrow
if
I
am
still
living
I
have
business
you
know
But
what
makes
you
ask
me
about
it
Oil
nothing
answered
Nadyezhda
Alex
yevna
What
was
the
reason
though
Nothing
she
repeated
I
am
surprised
at
the
curiosity
of
a
man
who
is
going
away
to-morrow
and
to-day
cares
to
find
out
what
I
am
like
But
really
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
beginning
Oh
this
is
appropriate
read
this
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
interrupted
him
with
a
laugh
handing
him
the
paper
from
a
sweet
which
she
had
just
picked
up
from
a
little
table
and
she
got
up
to
meet
Marya
Pavlovna
who
had
come
up
to
her
with
another
lady
Marya
Pavlovna
was
dancing
with
Pyotr
Alexeitch
Her
face
was
flushed
and
heated
but
did
not
look
any
happier
Vladimir
Sergeitch
looked
at
the
paper
on
it
was
printed
in
inferior
French
type
Qui
me
neglige
me
perd
He
looked
up
and
caught
Steltchinsky
's
eyes
fixed
upon
him
Vladimir
Sergeitch
gave
a
forced
smile
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
back
of
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
a
chair
and
crossed
his
legs
as
though
to
say
So
much
for
you
The
ardent
artillery
officer
whirled
Nad
yezhda
Alexyevna
back
to
her
seat
slowly
ro
tated
with
her
in
front
of
it
made
a
bow
clanked
his
spurs
and
departed
She
sat
down
Allow
me
to
ask
Vladimir
Sergeitch
be
gan
deliberately
how
am
I
to
take
that
motto
What
was
it
said
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
Oh
yes
Qui
yne
neglige
me
perd
Why
It
is
an
excellent
practical
rule
which
may
apply
at
every
turn
To
succeed
in
any
pursuit
one
must
neglect
nothing
One
must
try
for
all
and
perhaps
one
will
get
something
But
it
's
funny
here
am
I
I
giving
good
advice
to
a
practical
person
like
you
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
laughed
and
for
the
rest
of
the
mazurka
Vladimir
Sergeitch
tried
in
vain
to
go
back
to
the
previous
conversation
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
turned
it
off
with
the
wilfulness
of
a
capricious
child
Vladimir
Sergeitch
talked
to
her
of
her
feelings
and
she
either
refrained
from
answering
him
altogether
or
drew
his
attention
to
the
dresses
of
the
ladies
to
the
absurd
faces
of
some
of
the
men
to
the
perfection
of
her
brother
's
dancing
to
the
beauty
of
Marya
Pavlovna
she
talked
about
music
of
what
they
had
done
the
day
before
of
Yegor
Kapitonitch
and
his
wife
Matryona
Markovna
and
only
at
the
very
end
of
the
mazurka
when
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
be
ginning
to
make
his
last
bows
she
said
with
an
ironical
smile
on
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
And
so
you
really
are
going
away
to-mor
row
Yes
and
perhaps
for
a
long
journey
Vladimir
Sergeitch
said
significantly
I
wish
you
bon
voyage
And
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
went
quickly
to
her
brother
whis
pered
something
gaily
in
his
ear
then
asked
aloud
Are
you
grateful
to
me
Yes
Aren't
you
But
for
me
he
would
have
asked
her
for
the
mazurka
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
It
will
lead
to
nothing
anyway
She
led
him
into
the
drawing-room
The
flirt
thought
Vladimir
Sergeitch
and
picking
up
his
hat
he
slipped
unnoticed
out
of
S28
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
the
ballroom
found
his
groom
whom
he
had
told
to
be
in
readiness
and
was
putting
on
his
overcoat
when
to
his
extreme
astonishment
his
groom
told
him
that
they
could
not
go
that
the
coachman
had
somehow
succeeded
in
getting
drunk
and
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
wak
ing
him
Swearing
very
briefly
but
very
ex
pressively
at
the
absent
coachman
there
were
other
people
in
the
hall
and
telling
the
groom
that
if
the
coachman
were
not
in
a
fit
state
by
the
early
morning
no
one
in
the
world
could
imagine
what
the
consequences
would
be
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
back
to
the
ballroom
and
asked
the
butler
to
give
him
a
bedroom
without
waiting
for
the
supper
which
was
being
laid
in
the
drawing-room
The
master
of
the
house
seemed
suddenly
to
spring
out
of
the
floor
just
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
elbow
Gav
ril
Stepanitch
wore
boots
without
heels
and
so
moved
about
noiselessly
and
began
persuad
ing
him
to
remain
telling
him
that
at
supper
there
would
be
some
first-rate
caviare
but
Vladimir
Sergeitch
refused
saying
he
had
a
headache
Half
an
hour
later
he
was
lying
on
a
small
bed
under
a
short
quilt
trying
to
go
to
sleep
But
he
could
not
sleep
though
he
tossed
from
side
to
side
though
he
tried
to
think
of
something
else
the
figure
of
Steltchinsky
per
sisted
in
haunting
him
Now
he
was
aim
ing
Now
he
was
firing
Astahov
is
killed
someone
was
saying
Vladimir
Serge
itch
could
not
be
called
valiant
though
he
was
not
a
coward
either
but
the
idea
of
fighting
a
duel
with
anyone
had
never
entered
his
head
The
notion
of
fighting
with
his
good
sense
peaceable
disposition
regard
for
propri
ety
dreams
of
future
prosperity
and
making
a
good
marriage
If
he
had
not
been
the
per
son
concerned
he
would
have
burst
out
laugh
ing
the
whole
business
struck
him
as
so
ludi
crous
and
absurd
To
fight
And
with
whom
and
for
what
Damn
it
all
What
nonsense
he
uncon
sciously
exclaimed
aloud
well
and
if
he
really
does
kill
me
he
continued
his
meditations
I
must
take
measures
anyway
and
make
arrange
ments
Will
anyone
regret
me
And
with
vexation
he
closed
his
wide-open
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
eyes
drew
the
quilt
up
to
his
neck
but
still
could
not
sleep
There
was
a
faint
flush
of
dawn
in
the
sky
and
worn
out
with
feverish
sleeplessness
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
dropping
into
a
doze
when
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
a
weight
on
his
feet
He
opened
his
eyes
Veretyev
was
sitting
on
his
bed
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
extremely
surprised
especially
when
he
noticed
that
Veretyev
had
no
coat
on
that
his
shirt
was
unbuttoned
and
his
bare
chest
was
visible
that
his
hair
was
falling
over
his
forehead
and
that
his
face
too
looked
changed
and
Vladimir
Sergeitch
sat
up
in
bed
May
I
ask
he
began
with
a
gesture
of
surprise
I
have
come
to
see
you
Veretyev
began
in
a
hoarse
voice
in
this
condition
excuse
me
We
had
a
little
drink
I
wanted
to
re
assure
you
I
said
to
myself
there
's
a
gen
tleman
in
bed
up
there
who
probably
ca
n't
sleep
let
us
come
to
his
aid
Take
note
you
are
not
going
to
fight
to-morrow
and
you
can
sleep
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
more
surprised
than
ever
What
did
you
say
he
muttered
Yes
it
is
all
settled
Veretyev
went
on
that
gentleman
from
the
shores
of
the
Vistula
Steltchinsky
apologises
to
you
you
will
get
a
letter
from
him
to-morrow
I
tell
you
again
it
's
all
over
You
can
snore
And
saying
this
Veretyev
got
up
and
made
unsteadily
for
the
door
But
excuse
me
excuse
me
Vladimir
Serge
itch
began
how
did
you
find
out
and
how
can
I
believe
Ah
You
think
that
I
am
h
'm
and
he
gave
a
slight
lurch
forward
I
tell
you
he
will
send
you
a
letter
to-morrow
You
do
n't
attract
me
particularly
but
generosity
is
my
weak
point
And
what
's
the
good
of
talking
It
's
all
such
nonsense
But
confess
he
added
with
a
wink
you
were
a
Httle
scared
were
n't
you
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
angry
Excuse
me
sir
he
said
Oh
all
right
all
right
Veretyev
interrupted
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
with
a
good-natured
smile
Do
n't
get
excited
You
do
n't
know
that
we
never
have
a
ball
with
out
an
incident
of
this
sort
It
's
the
regu
lar
thing
It
never
leads
to
anything
As
though
anyone
wants
to
make
a
target
of
him
self
But
why
not
show
off
a
bit
to
a
new
comer
for
instance
In
vino
Veritas
Though
neither
you
nor
I
know
Latin
But
I
see
from
your
appearance
that
you
are
sleepy
I
wish
you
a
good-night
you
practical
person
and
well-intentioned
mortal
Accept
that
wish
from
another
mortal
who
is
not
worth
a
half
penny
Addio
niio
caro
x
And
Veretyev
went
away
What
on
earth
is
the
meaning
of
it
ex
claimed
Vladimir
Sergeitch
a
little
later
and
he
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
pillow
It's
beyond
everything
It
must
be
explained
I
wo
n't
put
up
with
it
For
all
that
five
minutes
later
he
was
in
a
quiet
sound
sleep
His
heart
was
lighter
A
danger
passed
softens
and
fills
with
sweetness
the
heart
of
man
This
is
what
had
happened
before
Veretyev's
sudden
interview
with
Vladimir
Sergeitch
in
the
night
Gavril
Stepanitch
had
a
second
cousin
a
bachelor
living
in
his
house
When
there
were
balls
young
men
would
run
down
to
his
room
on
the
ground
floor
to
smoke
in
the
intervals
between
the
dances
and
after
supper
they
as
sembled
there
for
a
friendly
drink
On
that
night
a
good
many
guests
had
gathered
together
in
his
room
Steltchinsky
and
Veretyev
were
among
them
Ivan
Ilyitch
the
Adjustable
Soul
had
strolled
down
there
also
They
mixed
punch
Though
Ivan
Ilyitch
had
promised
Astahov
to
say
nothing
about
the
approaching
duel
yet
when
Veretyev
casually
asked
him
what
he
had
been
talking
about
to
that
muff
Veretyev
always
spoke
of
Astahov
in
this
way
the
Adjustable
Soul
could
not
refrain
from
repeating
his
conversation
with
Vladimir
Sergeitch
word
for
word
Veretyev
laughed
then
grew
thoughtful
But
whom
is
he
fighting
with
he
asked
Well
that
I
ca
n't
tell
you
answered
Ivan
Ilyitch
Whom
was
he
talking
to
anyway
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
With
different
people
Yegor
Kapiton
itch
surely
he
is
not
fighting
with
him
Veretyev
walked
away
from
Ivan
Ilyitch
And
so
the
punch
was
made
and
they
began
drinking
it
Veretyev
was
sitting
in
the
most
conspicuous
place
gay
and
reckless
he
took
the
lead
in
all
young
men
's
parties
He
flung
off
his
coat
and
cravat
He
was
asked
to
sing
he
took
the
guitar
and
sang
several
songs
The
wine
began
to
go
to
their
heads
the
young
men
began
drinking
toasts
Steltchinsky
with
a
flushed
face
suddenly
leaped
onto
the
table
and
holding
his
glass
high
above
his
head
cried
aloud
To
the
health
of
I
know
whom
he
added
hurriedly
he
drank
off
the
wine
dashed
the
glass
to
the
floor
and
went
on
May
my
enemy
be
smashed
to
fragments
like
this
to
morrow
Veretyev
who
had
been
watching
him
for
some
time
raised
his
head
quickly
Steltchinsky
he
said
to
begin
with
get
off
that
table
it
's
unseemly
besides
your
boots
are
nothing
to
boast
of
And
then
come
here
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
He
drew
him
aside
Listen
my
boy
he
said
I
know
you
are
going
to
fight
to-morrow
with
that
Peters
burg
gentleman
Steltchinsky
started
How
who
told
you
I
tell
you
And
I
know
whom
you
are
fighting
about
too
Who
is
it
It
would
be
interesting
to
know
that
Oh
what
a
Talleyrand
Why
about
my
sister
of
course
Come
come
do
n't
pretend
to
be
surprised
It
makes
you
look
like
a
goose
I
ca
n't
imagine
how
it
came
about
but
I
know
it
is
so
Come
my
boy
eretyev
went
on
what
's
the
use
of
pretending
I
know
you
've
been
paying
her
attention
for
a
long
time
But
that
proves
nothing
Leave
off
please
But
listen
to
what
I
am
going
to
say
to
you
I
wo
n't
allow
this
duel
on
any
account
Do
you
understand
that
All
this
folly
will
recoil
on
my
sister
Ex
cuse
me
but
as
long
as
I
am
alive
I
will
not
allow
it
If
you
and
I
go
to
ruin
that's
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
what
we
deserve
but
she
ought
to
have
a
long
life
and
a
happy
one
Yes
I
swear
he
added
with
sudden
heat
I
would
betray
everyone
else
even
those
who
are
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
me
but
I
wo
n't
let
anyone
touch
her
Steltchinsky
gave
a
forced
laugh
You
are
drunk
my
dear
fellow
and
rav
ing
that
's
all
And
are
n't
you
But
whether
I
am
drunk
or
not
does
not
matter
I
am
talking
sense
You
will
not
fight
with
that
gentleman
that
I
can
guarantee
What
possessed
you
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
Were
you
jealous
or
what
How
true
it
is
that
people
are
fools
when
they
are
in
love
Why
she
only
danced
with
him
to
prevent
him
from
asking
But
that
's
not
the
point
The
duel
will
not
come
off
H
'm
I
should
like
to
know
how
you
are
going
to
prevent
me
Why
like
this
if
you
wo
n't
promise
this
minute
to
give
up
this
duel
I
will
fight
you
myself
Indeed
My
dear
fellow
do
n't
doubt
it
I
will
in
sult
you
in
the
most
original
way
imaginable
before
everyone
this
minute
and
then
we
will
fight
across
a
handkerchief
if
you
like
But
I
imagine
this
would
not
be
to
your
liking
for
several
reasons
would
it
Steltchinsky
fired
up
began
to
say
that
this
was
intimidation
that
he
would
allow
no
one
to
interfere
in
his
private
affairs
that
he
should
consider
nothing
and
ended
by
giving
way
and
renouncing
all
attempts
on
the
life
of
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Veretyev
embraced
him
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
were
for
the
tenth
time
drinking
Brilderschaft
that
is
drinking
with
arms
interlocked
The
young
leader
of
the
dance
drank
Briiderschaft
with
them
too
and
at
first
kept
pace
with
them
but
at
last
fell
asleep
in
the
most
innocent
way
and
lay
for
a
long
time
on
his
back
in
a
con
dition
of
complete
unconsciousness
The
ex
pression
of
his
little
pale
face
was
both
pathetic
and
amusing
Good
heavens
what
would
the
society
ladies
of
his
ac
quaintance
have
said
if
they
had
seen
him
in
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
sucS
d
sorry
plight
But
fortunately
he
did
not
know
any
society
ladies
Ivan
Ilyitch
too
distinguished
himself
that
night
To
begin
with
he
astonished
the
assem
bled
gentlemen
by
suddenly
striking
up
Once
upon
a
time
a
baron
The
hawfinch
The
hawfinch
is
singing
they
all
shouted
The
hawfinch
never
sings
at
night
As
though
I
only
knew
one
song
retorted
Ivan
Ilyitch
excited
by
the
wine
I
know
others
too
All
right
show
us
your
talents
Ivan
Ilyitch
was
silent
for
a
space
and
then
began
in
a
bass
voice
Krambambuli
the
home
of
my
fathers
but
so
queerly
and
out
of
tune
that
a
general
shout
of
laughter
drowned
his
voice
and
he
subsided
When
the
party
broke
up
Veretyev
went
to
see
Vladimir
Sergeitch
and
the
brief
conversa
tion
we
have
described
already
took
place
be
tween
them
Very
early
the
next
day
Vladimir
Sergeitch
set
off
for
Sasovo
He
spent
the
whole
mom
ing
in
agitation
almost
mistook
a
merchant
who
called
on
him
for
a
second
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
the
footman
brought
him
a
letter
from
Steltchinsky
Vladimir
Serge
itch
read
the
letter
through
several
times
it
was
very
cleverly
written
Steltchinsky
began
with
the
words
la
nuit
parte
con
sell
Monsieur
and
did
not
apologise
since
in
his
opinion
he
had
not
insulted
his
opponent
in
any
way
at
the
same
time
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
been
too
hasty
the
evening
before
and
con
cluded
by
saying
that
he
was
completely
at
the
service
de
M-r
Astakhof
but
for
himself
no
longer
desired
satisfaction
After
writing
and
dispatching
a
reply
filled
with
a
courtesy
that
almost
approached
mockery
and
a
feeling
of
dignity
which
did
not
however
show
a
trace
of
boastfulness
Vladimir
Sergeitch
sat
down
to
his
dinner
rubbing
his
hands
ate
it
with
great
relish
and
immediately
after
it
set
off
to
his
own
home
without
having
even
sent
a
change
of
horses
in
advance
The
road
by
which
he
drove
lay
within
three
miles
of
Ipatov
's
house
Vladimir
Sergeitch
gazed
at
it
Farewell
quiet
backwater
he
muttered
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
ironically
The
figures
of
Nadyezhda
Alex
yevna
and
Marya
Pavlovna
flitted
for
a
mo
ment
before
his
imagination
he
waved
them
off
turned
away
and
fell
into
a
doze
CHAPTER
VI
Over
three
months
passed
The
autumn
was
far
advanced
the
yellow
woods
were
losing
their
last
leaves
the
blue-tits
had
arrived
and
sure
sign
of
the
approach
of
winter
the
wind
was
beginning
to
groan
and
howl
But
there
had
not
yet
been
much
rain
and
the
mud
on
the
roads
was
not
yet
very
sloppy
Vladimir
Sergeitch
took
advantage
of
this
circumstance
to
visit
the
chief
town
of
the
province
in
or
der
to
conclude
some
business
transactions
He
spent
the
morning
driving
from
one
place
to
another
and
in
the
evening
went
to
the
club
He
met
several
acquaintances
in
the
big
gloomy
clubroom
among
them
an
old
retired
cavalry
officer
Flitch
whom
everyone
knew
as
a
capable
business
man
a
wit
a
cardplayer
and
a
gossip
Vladimir
Sergeitch
got
into
con
versation
with
him
Oh
by
the
way
Flitch
exclaimed
sud
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
denly
a
lady
you
know
was
passing
through
the
town
the
other
day
and
she
sent
you
her
greetings
What
lady
Madame
Steltchinsky
I
do
n't
know
any
Madame
Steltchinsky
You
knew
her
before
she
was
married
Her
maiden
name
was
Veretyev
Nad
yezhda
Alexyevna
Her
husband
was
in
our
Governor
's
service
You
must
have
seen
him
too
A
lively
fellow
with
a
little
mous
tache
He
has
hooked
an
attractive
little
party
and
with
money
too
You
do
n't
say
so
I
said
Vladimir
vSergeitch
So
she
has
married
him
H
'm
And
where
was
she
going
To
Petersburg
She
told
me
to
remind
you
about
some
motto
What
was
it
if
I
may
be
so
inquisitive
And
the
old
gossip
's
sharp
nose
looked
alert
with
expectation
I
do
n't
remember
really
some
joke
re
plied
Vladimir
Sergeitch
And
where
is
her
brother
may
I
ask
Pyotr
Oh
he
is
in
a
bad
way
Mr
Flitch
turned
up
his
fox-hke
little
eyes
and
heaved
a
sigh
How
so
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
He
's
gone
to
the
dogs
He
is
on
the
road
to
ruin
Where
is
he
now
then
Nobody
knows
He
is
gone
off
after
some
gipsy
girls
that
's
the
most
likely
story
He
is
not
in
the
province
that
I
can
answer
for
And
old
Ipatov
is
he
still
living
there
Mihail
Nikolaitch
The
queer
little
chap
you
mean
He
is
still
there
And
is
everyone
in
his
house
as
be
fore
Yes
to
be
sure
How
would
it
be
for
you
to
marry
his
sister-in-law
She
is
a
regular
piece
of
antique
sculpture
is
n't
she
He-he
People
did
say
you
know
Really
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
screwing
up
his
eyelids
At
that
moment
Flitch
was
invited
to
a
game
of
cards
and
the
conversation
dropped
Vladimir
Sergeitch
had
intended
to
return
home
quickly
but
a
messenger
arrived
from
the
village
elder
at
Sasovo
telling
him
that
six
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
peasant
homesteads
had
been
burnt
to
the
ground
and
he
decided
to
go
down
himself
It
was
reckoned
about
forty
miles
from
the
town
to
Sasovo
Vladimir
Sergeitch
reached
that
evening
the
little
lodge
with
which
the
reader
is
already
familiar
at
once
summoned
the
village
elder
and
the
rural
clerk
duly
up
braided
them
went
in
the
morning
to
inspect
the
scene
of
the
fire
directed
that
various
steps
should
be
taken
and
when
he
had
dined
de
cided
after
a
brief
hesitation
to
pay
a
call
on
Ipatov
Vladimir
Sergeitch
would
have
stayed
at
home
if
he
had
not
heard
from
Flitch
that
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
had
left
the
neighbour
hood
He
did
not
want
to
meet
her
again
but
he
felt
no
disinclination
to
have
another
look
at
Marya
Pavlovna
As
on
his
first
visit
Vladimir
Sergeitch
found
Ipatov
playing
draughts
with
the
Ad
justable
Soul
The
old
man
was
delighted
to
see
him
Vladimir
Sergeitch
fancied
however
that
his
face
was
careworn
and
his
words
did
not
flow
with
the
same
readiness
as
of
old
Vladimir
Sergeitch
exchanged
silent
glances
with
Ivan
Ilyitch
They
both
feh
a
twinge
of
discomfort
but
they
soon
got
over
it
Are
all
your
household
well
inquired
Vladimir
Sergeitch
as
he
sat
down
They
are
all
quite
well
thank
you
an
swered
Ipatov
Only
Marya
Pavlovna
is
not
quite
the
thing
she
keeps
to
her
room
for
the
most
part
now
Has
she
got
a
cold
No
not
exactly
She
will
come
in
to
tea
And
Yegor
Kapitonitch
How
is
he
get
ting
on
Ah
it
is
all
over
with
Yegor
Kapitonitch
His
wife
is
dead
Impossible
She
died
after
twenty-four
hours
illness
of
cholera
You
would
n't
know
him
now
he
is
not
like
himself
'Without
Matryona
Mark
ovna
life
is
a
burden
to
me
I
shall
die
he
says
'and
thank
Godj
I
do
n't
care
to
live
he
says
Yes
the
poor
fellow
is
quite
lost
Oh
dear
how
unfortunate
cried
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Poor
Yegor
Kapitonitch
Everyone
was
silent
for
a
space
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
I
hear
your
neighbour
is
married
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
flushing
sHghtly
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
Yes
she
is
mar
ried
Ipatov
stole
a
side-long
glance
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Yes
yes
she
is
married
and
gone
away
To
Petersburg
To
Petersburg
I
expect
Marya
Pavlovna
misses
her
I
think
they
were
great
friends
Of
course
she
misses
her
That
ca
n't
be
helped
Though
as
for
her
friendship
I
can
assure
you
young
ladies
friendship
is
worse
than
men
's
It
's
all
right
while
they
are
to
gether
but
out
of
sight
is
out
of
mind
Do
you
think
so
Yes
indeed
Take
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
for
instance
We
have
not
had
one
letter
from
her
since
she
went
away
and
the
promises
she
made
the
vows
No
doubt
she
has
other
things
to
think
of
now
Has
she
been
gone
long
It
must
be
six
weeks
She
galloped
off
the
day
after
the
wedding
in
foreign
style
They
say
her
brother
is
not
here
either
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
a
little
later
Yes
he
is
gone
too
You
see
they
are
city
people
they
are
not
Hkely
to
stay
long
in
the
country
And
do
n't
you
know
where
he
has
gone
No
He
is
here
to-day
and
gone
to-morrow
observed
Ivan
Ilyitch
He
is
here
to-day
and
gone
to-morrow
re
peated
Ipatov
And
you
Vladimir
Sergeitch
what
good
news
is
there
of
you
he
added
turning
round
in
his
chair
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
telling
about
him
self
Ipatov
listened
listened
and
exclaimed
at
last
But
why
does
n't
Masha
come
Ivan
Ily
itch
you
might
go
and
fetch
her
Ivan
Ilyitch
went
out
of
the
room
and
re
turning
announced
that
Marya
Pavlovna
was
just
coming
Has
she
a
headache
Ipatov
asked
in
a
low
voice
Yes
answered
Ivan
Ilyitch
The
door
opened
and
Marya
Pavlovna
came
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
in
Vladimir
Sergeitch
got
up
bowed
and
was
so
amazed
that
he
could
not
utter
a
word
so
changed
was
Marya
Pavlovna
since
he
had
seen
her
last
All
the
colour
had
gone
from
her
wan
cheeks
there
were
wide
dark
rings
round
her
eyes
there
was
a
look
of
grief
about
her
tightly
set
lips
her
whole
face
dark
and
immovable
seemed
turned
to
stone
She
lifted
her
eyes
and
there
was
no
light
in
them
How
do
you
feel
Ipatov
asked
her
I
am
quite
well
she
answered
and
sat
down
to
the
table
on
which
a
samovar
was
al
ready
boiling
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
pretty
thoroughly
bored
that
evening
and
indeed
everyone
was
depressed
The
conversation
was
continually
taking
a
melancholy
turn
Hark
what
a
tune
it
's
playing
Ipatov
said
among
other
things
listening
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
Summer
has
long
past
the
autumn
is
passing
too
and
winter
is
upon
us
The
snowdrifts
will
lie
about
us
again
If
only
the
snow
would
come
soon
As
it
is
it
makes
one
depressed
to
go
into
the
garden
It
's
a
perfect
ruin
The
branches
creak
and
rattle
Yes
the
fine
days
are
over
They
are
over
repeated
Ivan
Ilyitch
Marya
Pavlovna
looked
out
of
the
vi^indow
in
silence
Please
God
they
will
come
back
observed
Ipatov
No
one
answered
him
Do
you
remember
the
delightful
singing
we
had
here
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Yes
those
were
pleasant
times
But
you
might
sing
said
Vladimir
Serge
itch
turning
to
Marya
Pavlovna
you
have
such
a
splendid
voice
She
did
not
answer
And
how
is
your
mother
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
to
Ipatov
not
knowing
how
to
keep
up
the
conversation
Thank
God
she
keeps
pretty
middling
in
spite
of
her
infirmities
To-day
she
went
out
in
her
chair
and
I
tell
you
she
is
like
an
old
broken
tree
it
creaks
and
creaks
and
yet
some
strong
young
sapling
will
fall
and
it
will
go
on
standing
Ech
ech
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Marya
Pavlovna
dropped
her
hands
on
her
knees
and
bowed
her
head
And
yet
she
has
a
bad
time
of
it
Ipatov
said
again
it
's
a
true
saying
that
old
age
is
no
happiness
Youth
is
n't
happiness
either
said
Marya
Pavlovna
as
though
to
herself
Vladimir
Sergeitch
wanted
to
go
home
that
evening
but
it
was
such
a
dark
night
that
he
did
not
venture
to
go
He
was
given
the
same
upstairs
room
in
which
three
months
before
he
had
spent
a
troubled
night
owing
to
Yegor
Kapitonitch
I
wonder
whether
he
still
snores
thought
Vladimir
Sergeitch
and
remembered
his
ad
monitions
to
his
servant
he
recalled
Marya
Pavlovna
's
sudden
appearance
in
the
gar
den
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
to
the
window
and
put
his
head
against
the
cold
pane
His
own
face
looked
in
at
him
dimly
from
without
his
eyes
seemed
up
against
a
curtain
of
darkness
and
only
after
a
little
time
could
he
distinguish
against
the
starless
sky
the
branches
of
trees
twisting
convulsively
in
the
black
night
They
were
being
lashed
by
the
relentless
wind
All
at
once
it
seemed
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
as
though
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
white
on
the
ground
He
looked
smiled
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
exclaiming
half
aloud
The
tricks
imagination
will
play
one
got
into
bed
He
fell
asleep
very
quickly
but
he
was
not
fated
to
spend
a
peaceful
night
on
this
occa
sion
either
He
was
roused
by
a
hurrying
to
and
fro
in
the
house
He
lifted
up
his
head
from
the
pillow
He
heard
agitated
voices
exclamations
scurrying
footsteps
the
banging
of
doors
then
there
was
a
sound
of
women's
weeping
shouts
were
heard
in
the
garden
other
shouts
answered
them
in
the
distance
The
agitation
in
the
house
increased
and
grew
noisier
every
moment
There
must
be
a
fire
flashed
through
Vladimir
Sergeitch's
mind
In
alarm
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
the
window
but
there
was
no
glow
of
fire
only
red
points
of
light
were
moving
rap
idly
along
the
garden
paths
between
the
trees
