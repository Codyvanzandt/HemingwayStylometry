a
third
and
accepted
one
of
Arkady
's
cigars
though
instead
of
smoking
it
he
put
it
into
his
pocket
to
take
home
with
him
The
only
thing
that
was
at
all
unpleasant
was
the
fact
that
every
now
and
then
on
raising
a
stealthy
hand
to
brush
from
his
face
a
fly
he
in
lieu
of
doing
so
crushed
the
insect
flat
Dinner
over
he
seated
himself
with
modest
zest
at
the
card-table
and
ended
by
despoiling
Bazarov
of
two-and-a-half
roubles
in
paper
money
this
rural
establishment
took
no
account
of
the
system
of
computing
cash
in
silver
During
the
game
the
hostess
sat
beside
her
son
with
her
cheek
resting
on
her
hand
as
usual
and
only
rose
from
the
table
when
it
became
necessary
to
order
further
relays
of
refreshment
Yet
to
caress
Bazarov
was
more
than
she
dared
do
nor
did
he
give
her
the
least
encouragement
in
that
direction
in
addition
to
which
Vasili
Ivanitch
further
restrained
her
ardour
by
whispering
at
intervals
Do
not
worry
our
Evgenii
Young
men
do
not
like
that
sort
of
thing
Also
hardly
need
it
be
said
that
the
dinner
of
which
the
company
had
just
partaken
had
been
of
the
usual
sumptuousness
seeing
that
at
break
of
day
Timotheitch
had
set
out
for
Circassian
beef
and
that
the
starosta
also
had
galloped
in
quest
of
trout
eels
and
crabs
while
a
sum
of
forty-two
kopecks
had
been
paid
to
peasant
women
for
mushrooms
Arina
Vlasievna
's
eyes
fixed
immovably
upon
Bazarov
had
in
them
something
more
than
tenderness
and
affection
In
them
there
were
also
sadness
curiosity
a
touch
of
apprehension
and
a
kind
of
painful
deference
Yet
never
did
he
mark
their
expression
since
never
did
he
turn
in
her
direction
save
to
put
to
her
the
curtest
of
questions
and
once
to
ask
her
to
lay
her
hand
in
his
for
luck
On
the
latter
occasion
she
slipped
her
plump
fingers
into
his
hard
capacious
palm
waited
a
little
and
then
asked
him
Has
that
helped
you
at
all
in
your
play
It
has
not
he
replied
with
a
contemptuous
grimace
On
the
contrary
things
are
even
worse
than
they
were
before
Yes
the
cards
seem
to
be
against
you
remarked
Father
Alexis
with
an
assumed
air
of
sympathy
as
he
stroked
his
handsome
beard
But
beware
of
the
Code
Napoleon
my
father
observed
Vasili
Ivanitch
as
he
played
an
ace
Beware
of
the
Code
Napoleon
Which
in
the
end
brought
Napoleon
to
St
Helena
retorted
the
father
as
he
trumped
the
ace
A
glass
of
currant
wine
Eniushka
dear
asked
Arina
Vlasievna
Bazarov
replied
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
Next
day
he
said
to
Arkady
To-morrow
I
must
depart
The
place
wearies
me
for
I
wish
to
work
and
it
is
impossible
to
do
so
here
I
will
come
to
your
place
I
think
for
all
my
chemical
preparations
are
there
Moreover
one
can
at
least
lock
one
's
door
at
your
place
whereas
here
though
my
father
keeps
saying
'My
study
is
entirely
at
your
disposal
and
no
one
shall
disturb
you
he
himself
is
never
absent
for
a
moment
And
for
that
matter
I
should
be
ashamed
to
lock
him
outside
or
my
mother
either
Sometimes
I
can
hear
her
groaning
in
the
next
room
Yet
no
sooner
do
I
go
out
to
her
than
I
find
that
I
have
not
a
word
to
say
She
will
be
much
distressed
at
your
departure
said
Arkady
And
so
will
he
But
I
intend
to
return
Exactly
when
When
I
am
on
my
way
back
to
St
Petersburg
I
am
particularly
sorry
for
your
mother
Why
so
Has
she
been
stuffing
you
with
fruit
Arkady
lowered
his
eyes
You
do
not
know
her
he
said
She
is
not
only
a
good
woman
but
also
a
very
wise
one
This
morning
I
had
half
an
hour
's
very
practical
and
interesting
talk
with
her
A
talk
in
which
she
told
you
all
about
me
We
spoke
of
other
topics
besides
yourself
Possibly
Possibly
too
you
as
an
outsider
may
see
things
clearer
than
I
do
Yet
when
a
woman
can
talk
for
half
an
hour
it
is
a
good
sign
and
I
will
depart
as
I
have
said
But
you
will
not
find
it
easy
to
break
the
news
to
her
for
her
plans
for
us
extend
over
a
couple
of
weeks
No
it
may
not
prove
easy
as
you
say
and
the
less
so
since
the
devil
led
me
to
vex
my
father
this
morning
It
was
like
this
A
few
days
ago
he
had
one
of
his
serfs
flogged
and
therein
did
rightly
No
you
need
not
look
at
me
with
such
indignation
I
say
my
father
did
rightly
for
the
reason
that
the
peasant
in
question
had
proved
himself
to
be
an
arrant
thief
and
drunkard
Unfortunately
my
father
had
not
expected
me
to
get
to
hear
of
the
occurrence
wherefore
he
was
the
more
put
out
when
he
found
that
I
had
done
so
Well
now
his
vexation
will
be
twofold
However
no
matter
He
will
get
over
it
before
long
Yet
though
Bazarov
had
said
No
matter
he
let
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
day
elapse
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
acquaint
Vasili
Ivanitch
with
his
intention
Finally
just
as
he
was
saying
good-night
to
his
father
in
the
study
he
observed
with
a
prolonged
yawn
By
the
way
I
had
almost
forgotten
to
request
you
to
have
our
horses
sent
forward
to
Thedot
's
Vasili
Ivanitch
looked
thunderstruck
Then
is
Monsieur
Kirsanov
leaving
us
he
inquired
Yes
and
I
am
going
with
him
Vasili
Ivanitch
fidgeted
for
a
moment
or
two
You
say
that
you
are
going
with
him
he
murmured
Yes
I
must
go
So
pray
have
the
horses
sent
forward
as
requested
I
I
will
I
will
the
old
man
stuttered
So
they
are
to
go
to
Thedot
's
Yes
yes
very
well
Only
only
is
there
any
particular
reason
for
this
change
of
plan
There
is
I
am
engaged
to
pay
Arkady
a
short
visit
That
done
I
will
return
to
you
Only
to
be
a
short
visit
Good
And
Vasili
Ivanitch
pulled
out
his
pocket-handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
In
doing
so
he
bent
his
head
very
low
almost
to
the
ground
Well
well
Things
shall
be
as
you
desire
Yet
we
had
hoped
that
you
would
have
stayed
with
us
a
little
longer
Three
days
only
Three
days
after
three
years
of
absence
Ah
that
is
not
much
Evgenii
it
is
not
much
But
I
tell
you
I
intend
to
return
soon
You
see
I
must
go
You
have
no
choice
eh
Very
well
very
well
Of
course
engagements
must
be
kept
Yes
yes
of
course
they
must
be
kept
And
I
am
to
send
the
horses
forward
Very
good
Naturally
Arina
and
I
had
not
altogether
looked
for
this
Only
to-day
she
has
been
to
a
neighbour
to
beg
flowers
for
your
room
Nor
of
the
fact
that
each
morning
he
had
gone
downstairs
in
his
slippers
to
confer
with
Timotheitch
nor
of
the
fact
that
producing
with
tremulous
fingers
one
ragged
banknote
after
another
he
had
commissioned
his
henchman
to
make
various
purchases
with
special
reference
to
the
question
of
eatables
in
particular
of
a
certain
red
wine
which
he
had
noticed
the
young
men
to
like
no
of
none
of
these
facts
did
Vasili
Ivanitch
make
any
mention
The
greatest
thing
in
the
world
is
one
's
freedom
he
went
on
I
too
make
it
my
rule
Never
should
one
let
oneself
be
hampered
or
A
sudden
break
occurred
in
his
voice
and
he
made
for
the
door
I
promise
you
that
we
will
return
soon
my
father
I
give
you
my
word
of
honour
upon
that
But
Vasili
Ivanitch
did
not
look
round
he
just
waved
his
hand
and
departed
Mounting
to
the
bedroom
he
found
Arina
asleep
so
started
to
say
his
prayers
in
an
undertone
for
fear
of
awaking
her
But
at
once
she
opened
her
eyes
In
that
you
Vasili
Ivanitch
she
asked
Yes
mother
Have
you
just
left
Eniusha
Do
you
know
I
am
anxious
about
him
Does
he
sleep
comfortably
on
the
sofa
To-day
I
told
Anfisushka
to
lay
him
out
your
travelling
mattress
and
the
new
pillows
Also
I
would
have
given
him
our
feather
bed
had
he
not
disliked
soft
lying
Do
not
fret
mother
dear
He
is
quite
comfortable
'Lord
pardon
us
sinners
And
Vasili
Ivanitch
went
on
with
his
prayers
Yet
his
heart
was
full
of
an
aching
compassion
for
his
old
companion
nor
did
he
want
to
tell
her
overnight
of
the
sorrow
which
was
awaiting
her
on
the
morrow
Next
day
therefore
Arkady
and
Bazarov
departed
From
earliest
morn
an
air
of
woe
pervaded
the
household
Anfisushka
let
fall
some
crockery
and
Thedika
's
perturbation
ended
in
his
taking
off
his
shoes
As
for
Vasili
Ivanitch
he
fussed
about
and
made
a
brave
show
he
talked
in
loud
tones
and
stamped
his
feet
upon
the
floor
as
he
walked
but
his
face
had
suddenly
fallen
in
and
his
glance
could
not
meet
that
of
his
son
Meanwhile
Arina
Vlasievna
indulged
in
quiet
weeping
Indeed
but
for
the
fact
that
her
husband
had
spent
two
hours
that
morning
in
comforting
her
she
would
have
broken
down
completely
and
lost
all
self-control
But
at
last
when
after
reiterated
promises
to
return
within
at
most
a
month
Bazarov
had
freed
himself
from
the
arms
which
sought
to
detain
him
and
entered
the
tarantass
when
the
horses
had
started
and
their
collar-bow
had
begun
to
tinkle
and
the
wheels
to
revolve
when
to
gaze
after
the
vehicle
any
longer
had
become
useless
and
the
dust
had
subsided
and
Timotheitch
bent
and
tottering
had
crawled
back
into
his
pantry
when
the
old
couple
found
themselves
alone
in
a
house
which
seemed
suddenly
to
have
grown
as
dishevelled
and
as
decrepit
as
they
then
ah
then
did
Vasili
Ivanitch
desist
from
his
brief
show
of
waving
his
handkerchief
in
the
verandah
and
sink
into
a
chair
and
drop
his
head
upon
his
breast
He
has
gone
for
ever
he
has
gone
for
ever
he
muttered
He
has
gone
because
he
found
the
life
here
tedious
and
once
more
I
am
as
lonely
as
the
sand
of
the
desert
These
words
he
kept
repeating
again
and
again
and
each
time
that
he
did
so
he
raised
his
hand
and
pointed
into
the
distance
But
presently
Arina
Vlasievna
approached
him
and
pressing
her
grey
head
to
his
said
Never
mind
my
Vasia
True
our
son
has
broken
away
from
us
he
is
like
a
falcon
he
has
flown
hither
he
has
flown
thither
as
he
willed
but
you
and
I
like
lichen
in
a
hollow
tree
are
still
side
by
side
we
are
not
parted
And
ever
I
shall
be
the
same
to
you
as
you
will
be
the
same
to
me
Taking
his
hands
from
his
face
Vasili
Ivanitch
embraced
his
old
comrade
his
wife
as
never
no
not
even
during
the
days
of
his
courtship
he
had
done
before
And
thus
she
comforted
him
1
Alexander
Vasilievitch
Suvorov
1729-1800
the
great
Russian
general
who
after
defeating
Napoleon
in
Italy
crossed
the
Alps
to
join
hands
with
Korsakov
but
found
the
latter
to
have
been
routed
by
Massena
In
silence
or
merely
exchanging
a
few
unimportant
words
the
travellers
made
their
way
to
Thedot
's
posting-house
Arkady
felt
anything
but
pleased
with
Bazarov
and
Bazarov
felt
anything
but
pleased
with
himself
Moreover
the
younger
man
's
heart
was
heavy
with
the
sort
of
unreasoning
depression
which
is
known
only
to
youth
The
driver
hitched
his
horses
and
then
mounting
to
the
box
inquired
whether
he
was
to
drive
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
Arkady
started
The
road
to
the
right
led
to
the
town
and
thence
to
his
father
's
house
while
the
road
to
the
left
led
to
Madame
Odintsov's
establishment
He
glanced
at
Bazarov
To
the
left
Evgenii
he
queried
Bazarov
turned
away
his
head
Why
that
folly
again
he
muttered
Folly
I
know
said
Arkady
but
what
does
that
matter
We
need
but
call
in
passing
Bazarov
pulled
his
cap
over
his
eyes
Do
as
you
like
he
said
To
the
left
then
cried
Arkady
to
the
coachman
and
the
tarantass
started
in
the
direction
of
Nikolsköe
Nevertheless
for
all
that
the
friends
had
decided
upon
this
foolish
course
they
remained
as
silent
and
downcast
as
ever
Indeed
Madame
Odintsov
's
butler
had
not
even
made
his
appearance
upon
the
verandah
before
the
pair
divined
that
they
had
done
unwisely
to
yield
to
such
an
impulse
The
fact
that
no
one
in
the
house
had
expected
them
was
emphasised
by
the
circumstance
that
when
Madame
entered
the
drawing-room
they
had
already
spent
a
considerable
time
there
in
awkward
silence
However
she
accorded
them
her
usual
suave
welcome
though
she
seemed
a
little
surprised
at
their
speedy
return
and
at
heart
not
over-pleased
at
it
For
this
reason
they
hastened
to
explain
that
theirs
was
a
mere
passing
call
and
that
in
about
four
hours
they
would
be
continuing
their
journey
to
the
town
In
reply
she
said
nothing
beyond
that
she
requested
Arkady
to
convey
her
greetings
to
his
father
and
then
sent
for
her
aunt
and
inasmuch
as
the
Princess
entered
in
a
state
of
having
just
overslept
herself
her
wrinkled
old
face
betokened
even
greater
malignity
than
usual
Katia
was
not
well
and
did
not
leave
her
room
at
all
and
this
caused
Arkady
suddenly
to
realise
that
he
would
have
been
as
glad
to
see
her
as
Anna
Sergievna
The
four
hours
were
filled
with
a
desultory
conversation
which
Anna
Sergievna
carried
on
without
a
single
smile
nor
until
the
very
moment
of
parting
did
her
usual
friendliness
seem
to
stir
within
her
soul
I
am
out
of
humour
to-day
she
said
but
that
you
must
not
mind
Come
again
soon
I
address
the
invitation
to
you
both
Bazarov
and
Arkady
responded
with
silent
bows
re-entered
the
tarantass
and
drove
forward
to
Marino
whither
they
arrived
without
incident
on
the
following
evening
En
route
neither
of
the
pair
mentioned
Madame
Odintsov
and
Barazov
in
particular
scarcely
opened
his
mouth
but
gazed
towards
the
horizon
with
a
hard
look
in
his
eyes
But
at
Marino
every
one
was
delighted
to
see
them
for
Nikolai
Petrovitch
had
begun
to
feel
uneasy
at
the
prolonged
absence
of
his
son
and
now
leapt
from
the
sofa
with
a
cry
of
joy
when
Thenichka
ran
to
announce
that
the
young
gentlemen
were
arriving
Yes
even
Paul
Petrovitch
felt
conscious
of
a
touch
of
pleasant
excitement
and
smiled
indulgently
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
wanderers
Ensued
then
much
talking
and
questioning
in
which
Arkady
took
the
leading
part
and
more
especially
during
supper
which
lasted
far
into
the
night
since
Nikolai
Petrovitch
ordered
up
several
bottles
of
porter
which
had
just
arrived
from
Moscow
and
made
so
merry
that
his
cheeks
assumed
a
raspberry
tint
and
he
fell
to
venting
half-boyish
half-hysterical
laughs
Moreover
the
general
enlivenment
extended
even
to
the
kitchen
where
Duniasha
kept
breathlessly
banging
doors
and
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
Peter
essayed
to
execute
on
the
guitar
a
Cossack
waltz
which
would
have
sounded
sweet
and
plaintive
amid
the
stillness
of
the
night
had
not
the
performance
broken
down
after
the
opening
cadenza
owing
to
the
fact
that
nature
had
denied
the
cultured
underling
a
talent
either
for
music
or
for
anything
else
Indeed
of
late
life
at
Marino
had
been
far
from
comfortable
In
particular
had
poor
Nikolai
Petrovitch
been
in
a
bad
way
for
his
troubles
in
connection
with
the
estate
troubles
of
an
exclusively
futile
and
hopeless
order
were
growing
greater
from
day
to
day
The
worst
of
them
came
of
the
system
of
hired
labour
which
enabled
some
of
the
workmen
to
keep
demanding
either
their
discharge
or
an
increase
of
wages
and
others
to
depart
as
soon
as
ever
they
had
received
their
earnest-money
Also
some
of
the
horses
had
fallen
sick
certain
implements
had
been
burnt
all
hands
were
performing
their
tasks
in
a
slovenly
manner
a
milling
machine
ordered
from
Moscow
had
turned
out
to
be
useless
owing
to
its
weight
a
second
such
machine
had
broken
down
on
its
first
being
used
half
the
cattle
sheds
had
disappeared
in
a
conflagration
caused
by
a
blind
old
serf
woman
smoking
her
cow
with
a
firestick
during
blustery
weather
though
she
herself
asserted
that
the
trouble
had
come
of
the
barin's
manufacturing
new-fangled
cheeses
and
lacteal
products
in
general
and
lastly
the
steward
had
grown
so
fat
and
lazy
as
do
all
Russians
who
fall
upon
easy
times
and
permitted
his
dislike
of
Nikolai
Petrovitch
so
to
limit
his
activities
that
he
had
come
to
doing
no
more
than
bestowing
an
occasional
prod
upon
a
passing
pig
or
threatening
some
half-naked
serf
boy
while
spending
the
rest
of
the
time
in
bed
Again
such
of
the
peasants
as
had
received
allotments
under
the
obrok
system
had
failed
to
pay
their
dues
as
well
as
applied
themselves
to
stealing
timber
to
such
an
extent
that
almost
every
night
the
watchman
had
to
apprehend
a
culprit
or
two
as
well
as
to
impound
horses
which
peasants
had
turned
out
to
graze
in
the
meadows
attached
to
the
manor
For
illicit
grazing
of
this
sort
Nikolai
Petrovitch
had
decreed
forfeiture
of
the
horses
but
usually
the
matter
ended
in
the
animals
being
kept
for
a
day
or
two
at
the
barin's
expense
and
then
restored
to
their
owners
Lastly
the
peasants
had
taken
to
quarrelling
among
themselves
through
brothers
conceiving
the
idea
of
demanding
a
share
of
each
other
's
earnings
and
through
their
wives
suddenly
finding
themselves
unable
to
get
on
in
the
same
hut
wherefore
feuds
had
arisen
which
had
caused
whole
households
to
spring
to
their
feet
as
at
a
word
of
command
and
to
flock
to
the
portico
of
the
estate
office
where
breaking
in
upon
the
barin's
privacy
very
often
with
bruised
faces
and
drunken
gait
they
demanded
justice
and
an
immediate
settlement
while
female
sobs
and
whimperings
mingled
with
the
curses
of
the
male
portion
of
the
throng
Whenever
this
had
happened
Nikolai
Petrovitch
had
had
to
part
the
hostile
factions
from
one
another
and
to
shout
himself
hoarse
even
though
he
had
known
in
advance
that
no
equitable
decision
was
feasible
Finally
there
had
been
a
deficiency
of
hands
for
the
harvest
since
a
neighbouring
odnovorzty
1
of
benign
aspect
who
had
undertaken
taken
to
provide
harvesters
at
two
roubles
per
desiatin
had
cheated
without
compunction
and
supplied
women
workers
who
also
demanded
extortionate
wages
Meanwhile
the
grain
had
rotted
in
the
fields
and
later
on
the
women
had
not
got
through
the
mowing
before
the
Board
of
Overseers
had
begun
to
press
for
immediate
payment
of
percentage
dues
and
arrears
I
can
do
nothing
would
be
Nikolai
Petrovitch
's
despairing
exclamation
My
principles
forbid
me
either
to
contend
with
these
people
or
to
send
for
the
stanovoi
2
yet
without
the
power
to
threaten
punishment
one
can
make
no
headway
with
such
folk
Du
calme
du
calme
Paul
Petrovitch
would
advise
Then
he
would
growl
frown
and
twist
his
moustache
From
these
brawls
Bazarov
kept
entirely
aloof
nor
as
a
guest
was
he
called
upon
to
interfere
in
them
but
was
free
from
the
day
of
his
arrival
to
apply
himself
solely
to
his
frogs
infusoria
and
chemical
compositions
On
the
other
hand
Arkady
considered
himself
bound
if
not
to
help
his
father
at
all
events
to
offer
to
help
him
wherefore
he
listened
to
Nikolai
's
complaints
with
patience
and
on
one
occasion
even
tendered
him
advice
though
not
advice
meant
to
be
taken
but
advice
designed
to
manifest
the
interest
felt
by
him
Arkady
in
current
affairs
As
a
matter
of
fact
estate-management
was
not
wholly
distasteful
to
him
and
he
could
find
pleasure
in
thinking
out
agricultural
problems
but
his
mind
was
filled
with
other
preoccupations
For
one
thing
he
discovered
to
his
surprise
that
his
thoughts
were
constantly
turning
in
the
direction
of
Nikolsköe
and
though
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
would
have
shrugged
his
shoulders
upon
being
told
that
he
would
ever
come
to
find
residence
under
the
same
roof
as
Bazarov
least
of
all
when
that
roof
was
his
father
's
a
dull
affair
he
found
time
hang
heavy
on
his
hands
and
his
attention
easily
stray
elsewhere
So
he
tried
the
expedient
of
walking
until
thoroughly
worn
out
but
even
this
did
not
help
him
until
eventually
he
learnt
in
conversation
with
his
father
that
recently
some
letters
of
great
interest
had
been
chanced
upon
letters
which
Arkady
's
mother
had
indited
to
the
mother
of
Madame
Odintsov
And
from
that
moment
onwards
he
never
rested
until
he
had
induced
Nikolai
Petrovitch
to
re-discover
the
said
letters
and
to
turn
out
during
the
search
a
score
of
boxes
and
drawers
Then
only
when
the
half-mouldy
documents
had
been
dragged
to
light
did
the
young
man
feel
easier
in
his
soul
and
bear
himself
as
though
now
he
saw
before
him
the
goal
of
his
existence
'I
address
the
invitation
to
both
of
you
he
kept
whispering
to
himself
Yes
that
is
what
she
said
Damn
it
I
will
go
But
next
there
would
recur
to
his
memory
the
recent
visit
and
its
cold
reception
until
once
more
he
would
be
seized
with
his
old
timidity
and
awkwardness
In
the
end
however
the
spirit
of
adventurous
youth
aided
by
a
secret
desire
to
try
his
luck
to
test
his
strength
unaided
and
without
a
protector
contrived
to
win
the
day
Ten
days
later
therefore
he
invented
a
pretext
in
the
shape
of
a
desire
to
study
the
working
of
Sunday
schools
to
drive
to
the
town
and
thence
to
Nikolsköe
As
he
drove
the
manner
in
which
he
encouraged
his
postilion
communicated
to
his
progress
the
character
rather
of
a
young
officer
's
trip
to
fight
his
first
duel
for
diffidence
impatience
and
delight
were
well-nigh
choking
him
Above
all
things
he
kept
reflecting
I
must
not
think
too
much
of
myself
And
though
the
postilion
who
had
fallen
to
his
lot
was
of
the
type
of
rascal
who
pulls
up
at
every
tavern
door
there
hove
in
sight
before
long
the
familiar
high-pitched
roof
of
the
mansion
But
what
am
I
doing
now
occurred
to
him
the
thought
Indeed
would
it
not
be
better
to
go
back
Unfortunately
to
the
sound
of
the
postilion
's
whistlings
and
tongue-clickings
the
troika
of
horses
trotted
bravely
forward
and
presently
the
bridge
thundered
under
the
combined
weight
of
the
hooves
and
wheels
Ah
there
was
the
avenue
of
clipped
firs
Yes
and
there
was
a
glimpse
of
a
pink
dress
amid
some
dark
foliage
Yes
and
there
a
glimpse
of
a
young
face
peering
from
the
shade
of
a
silken
parasol
Yes
yes
it
was
Katia
He
had
recognised
her
in
an
instant
as
she
him
Bidding
the
postilion
pull
up
Arkady
leapt
from
the
carriage
and
approached
the
maiden
So
it
is
you
she
exclaimed
And
at
the
same
moment
a
blush
overspread
her
face
Let
us
go
and
look
for
my
sister
She
is
in
the
garden
and
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
So
she
conducted
him
thither
How
lucky
that
he
had
met
her
as
he
had
done
More
pleased
he
could
not
have
felt
if
she
had
been
his
own
sister
Yes
things
were
indeed
fortunate
Now
there
would
have
to
be
no
butler
and
no
formal
announcement
of
his
arrival
Of
Anna
Sergievna
he
caught
sight
at
a
turn
in
the
path
She
had
her
back
to
him
but
presently
on
hearing
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
faced
about
Once
more
confusion
seized
Arkady
in
its
grip
Yet
no
sooner
had
she
spoken
than
he
felt
his
courage
return
How
do
you
do
she
said
in
her
even
kindly
way
as
she
advanced
to
meet
him
with
a
smile
that
was
slightly
tempered
with
the
sun
and
wind
Where
did
you
find
him
Katia
I
have
brought
with
me
something
which
you
are
unlikely
to
have
been
expecting
he
said
For
I
But
you
have
brought
me
yourself
she
rejoined
And
that
is
the
best
bringing
of
all
1
A
freeholder
a
member
of
the
class
which
in
the
days
of
this
story
stood
midway
between
the
pomiestchik
or
landowner
and
the
Krestianin
or
serf
2
Magistrate
After
speeding
Arkady
on
his
way
with
satirical
expressions
of
regret
as
well
as
giving
him
to
understand
that
the
satirist
laboured
under
no
delusions
as
to
the
object
of
the
young
man
's
journey
Bazarov
withdrew
into
complete
seclusion
since
a
perfect
fever
for
work
had
come
upon
him
Nor
did
he
quarrel
any
longer
with
Paul
Petrovitch
and
the
less
so
since
the
latter
had
now
come
to
adopt
an
exclusively
aristocratic
attitude
and
to
express
his
sentiments
only
in
monosyllables
not
in
words
Once
and
once
only
did
he
allow
himself
to
engage
in
a
controversy
with
Bazarov
over
the
then
current
question
of
the
rights
of
the
dvoriané
But
suddenly
he
checked
himself
and
said
with
an
air
of
cold
politeness
It
is
clear
that
we
shall
never
understand
one
another
At
all
events
I
have
not
the
honour
to
understand
you
True
agreed
Bazarov
For
a
man
may
understand
the
precipitation
of
ether
and
be
au
fait
with
what
is
taking
place
in
the
sun
yet
confront
him
with
the
fact
that
another
man
blows
his
nose
differently
from
the
manner
in
which
he
blows
his
own
and
at
once
that
man
will
become
lost
in
perplexity
At
the
same
time
there
were
occasions
when
Paul
Petrovitch
requested
permission
to
attend
the
other
's
experiments
and
once
he
went
so
far
as
to
apply
his
perfumed
clean-shaven
features
to
the
microscope
for
the
purpose
of
observing
how
a
transparent
infusorium
could
swallow
a
greenish-looking
particle
and
then
masticate
the
same
with
fang-like
protuberances
which
grew
in
its
throat
Still
more
frequently
was
Nikolai
Petrovitch
present
in
Bazarov
's
room
Indeed
but
for
the
counter-distraction
of
estate-management
he
would
have
spent
his
whole
time
in
the
process
of
what
he
called
self-improvement
Yet
he
never
hampered
the
young
naturalist
on
the
contrary
he
would
seat
himself
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
room
and
but
for
a
guarded
question
or
two
confine
himself
solely
to
silently
and
absorbedly
watching
the
experiments
Also
at
meal
times
he
always
endeavoured
to
turn
the
conversation
in
the
direction
of
physics
or
geology
or
chemistry
for
the
reason
that
he
divined
in
any
other
direction
that
of
industry
or
still
more
that
of
politics
there
lay
a
greater
danger
of
collisions
or
at
all
events
of
mutual
soreness
For
rightly
did
he
divine
that
his
brother
's
enmity
towards
Bazarov
had
by
no
means
abated
And
to
this
conclusion
an
incident
which
occurred
at
a
juncture
when
cholera
had
just
made
its
appearance
in
the
neighbourhood
and
carried
off
two
victims
from
Marino
itself
lent
additional
colour
One
night
Paul
Petrovitch
happened
to
be
seized
with
a
fainting
fit
yet
refused
to
apply
to
Bazarov
for
assistance
and
when
Bazarov
on
meeting
him
on
the
following
day
inquired
why
such
a
course
had
not
been
adopted
Paul
Petrovitch
still
pale
but
as
carefully
brushed
and
combed
as
ever
retorted
Did
not
you
yourself
tell
me
that
you
have
no
belief
in
medicine
Thus
day
followed
day
Yet
though
Bazarov
devoted
himself
wholly
to
work
there
was
one
person
in
the
house
whom
he
did
not
hold
at
arm's
length
but
was
always
willing
to
talk
to
That
person
was
Thenichka
Mostly
he
encountered
her
in
the
early
mornings
when
she
was
walking
in
the
garden
or
the
courtyard
but
never
did
he
enter
her
room
nor
did
she
ever
come
to
his
door
save
once
for
the
purpose
of
asking
him
to
help
her
with
Mitia
's
bath
And
she
not
only
trusted
Bazarov
she
also
held
him
in
no
awe
and
allowed
herself
more
freedom
in
his
presence
than
she
did
in
that
of
Nikolai
Petrovitch
himself
The
reason
is
difficult
to
determine
Perhaps
it
was
the
fact
that
unconsciously
she
detected
in
Bazarov
none
of
the
dvorianin
element
none
of
that
superiority
which
at
once
attracts
and
repels
the
young
Nihilist
to
her
was
just
a
clever
doctor
and
no
more
At
all
events
she
was
so
free
from
shyness
in
his
presence
that
she
would
dandle
her
child
unabashed
and
on
one
occasion
when
seized
with
a
headache
went
so
far
as
to
accept
at
his
hands
a
spoonful
of
medicine
True
in
Nikolai
Petrovitch
's
presence
she
seemed
to
shun
Bazarov
but
this
was
done
more
out
of
a
sense
of
decorum
than
through
subtlety
As
for
Paul
Petrovitch
she
feared
him
as
much
as
ever
for
he
had
taken
to
watching
her
with
a
keen
steady
eye
and
to
making
his
appearance
behind
her
as
though
his
figure
clad
in
its
inevitable
English
suit
and
posed
in
its
usual
attitude
of
hands
in
trousers
pockets
had
suddenly
sprung
from
the
floor
Whenever
I
see
him
I
feel
cold
all
over
once
she
complained
to
Duniasha
whereupon
that
maiden's
thoughts
reverted
longingly
to
another
unfeeling
individual
who
had
all
unwittingly
come
to
be
the
cruel
tyrant
of
her
heart
Thenichka
therefore
liked
Bazarov
and
Bazarov
liked
Thenichka
Indeed
no
sooner
did
he
speak
to
her
than
his
face
would
undergo
a
change
and
assuming
a
bright
almost
a
good-humoured
expression
exchange
its
habitual
superciliousness
for
something
like
playful
solicitude
Meanwhile
she
grew
more
beautiful
daily
In
the
lives
of
young
women
there
is
a
season
when
they
begin
to
