got
used
to
it
and
understand
but
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
the
dreams
even
of
healthy
people
and
with
him
it
's
awful
'I
am
very
happy
he
says
'I
was
walking
about
all
among
white
birds
to-day
and
the
Lord
God
gave
me
a
nosegay
and
in
the
nosegay
was
Andryusha
with
a
little
knife
he
calls
our
Lyubotchka
Andryusha
'now
we
shall
both
be
quite
well
he
says
'We
need
only
one
stroke
with
the
little
knife
like
this
and
he
points
to
his
throat
I
do
n't
understand
him
but
I
say
'All
right
dear
all
right
but
he
gets
angry
and
tries
to
explain
what
he
means
He
even
bursts
into
tears
But
you
should
have
said
something
to
him
I
put
in
you
should
have
made
up
some
lie
I
ca
n't
tell
lies
answered
Raissa
and
even
flung
up
her
hands
And
indeed
she
could
not
tell
lies
There
is
no
need
to
tell
lies
observed
David
but
there
is
no
need
to
kill
yourself
either
No
one
will
say
thank
you
for
it
you
know
Raissa
looked
at
him
intently
I
wanted
to
ask
you
something
Davidushka
how
ought
I
to
spell
'while
What
sort
of
'while
Why
for
instance
I
hope
you
will
live
a
long
while
Spell
w-i-l-e
No
I
put
in
w-h-i-l-e
Well
it
does
not
matter
Spell
it
with
an
h
then
What
does
matter
is
that
you
should
live
a
long
while
I
should
like
to
write
correctly
observed
Raissa
and
she
flushed
a
little
When
she
flushed
she
was
amazingly
pretty
at
once
It
may
be
of
use
How
father
wrote
in
his
day
wonderfully
He
taught
me
Well
now
he
can
hardly
make
out
the
letters
You
only
live
that
's
all
I
want
David
repeated
dropping
his
voice
and
not
taking
his
eyes
off
her
Raissa
glanced
quickly
at
him
and
flushed
still
more
You
live
and
as
for
spelling
spell
as
you
like
Oh
the
devil
the
witch
is
coming
David
called
my
aunt
the
witch
What
ill-luck
has
brought
her
this
way
You
must
go
darling
Raissa
glanced
at
David
once
more
and
ran
away
David
talked
to
me
of
Raissa
and
her
family
very
rarely
and
unwillingly
especially
from
the
time
when
he
began
to
expect
his
father
's
return
He
thought
of
nothing
but
him
and
how
we
should
live
together
afterwards
He
had
a
vivid
memory
of
him
and
used
to
describe
him
to
me
with
particular
pleasure
He
is
big
and
strong
he
can
lift
three
hundred-weight
with
one
hand
When
he
shouted
'Where
's
the
lad
he
could
be
heard
all
over
the
house
He
's
so
jolly
and
kind
and
a
brave
man
Nobody
can
intimidate
him
We
lived
so
happily
together
before
we
were
ruined
They
say
he
has
gone
quite
grey
and
in
old
days
his
hair
was
as
red
as
mine
He
was
a
strong
man
David
would
never
admit
that
we
might
remain
in
Ryazan
You
will
go
away
I
observed
but
I
shall
stay
Nonsense
we
shall
take
you
with
us
And
how
about
my
father
You
will
cast
off
your
father
You
will
be
ruined
if
you
do
n't
How
so
David
made
me
no
answer
but
merely
knitted
his
white
brows
So
when
we
go
away
with
father
he
began
again
he
will
get
a
good
situation
and
I
shall
marry
Well
that
wo
n't
be
just
directly
I
said
No
why
not
I
shall
marry
soon
You
Yes
I
why
not
You
have
n't
fixed
on
your
wife
I
suppose
Of
course
I
have
Who
is
she
David
laughed
What
a
senseless
fellow
you
are
really
Raissa
of
course
Raissa
I
repeated
in
amazement
you
are
joking
I
am
not
given
to
joking
and
do
n't
like
it
Why
she
is
a
year
older
than
you
are
What
of
it
but
let
's
drop
the
subject
Let
me
ask
one
question
I
said
Does
she
know
that
you
mean
to
marry
her
Most
likely
But
have
n't
you
declared
your
feelings
What
is
there
to
declare
When
the
time
comes
I
shall
tell
her
Come
that
's
enough
David
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
room
When
I
was
alone
I
pondered
and
pondered
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
David
would
act
like
a
sensible
and
practical
man
and
indeed
I
felt
flattered
at
the
thought
of
being
the
friend
of
such
a
practical
man
And
Raissa
in
her
everlasting
black
woollen
dress
suddenly
seemed
to
me
charming
and
worthy
of
the
most
devoted
love
David
's
father
still
did
not
come
and
did
not
even
send
a
letter
It
had
long
been
summer
and
June
was
drawing
to
its
end
We
were
wearing
ourselves
out
in
suspense
Meanwhile
there
began
to
be
rumours
that
Latkin
had
suddenly
become
much
worse
and
that
his
family
were
likely
to
die
of
hunger
or
else
the
house
would
fall
in
and
crush
them
all
under
the
roof
David
's
face
even
looked
changed
and
he
became
so
ill-tempered
and
surly
that
there
was
no
going
near
him
He
began
to
be
more
often
absent
from
home
too
I
did
not
meet
Raissa
at
all
From
time
to
time
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
in
the
distance
rapidly
crossing
the
street
with
her
beautiful
light
step
straight
as
an
arrow
with
her
arms
crossed
with
her
dark
clever
eyes
under
her
long
brows
with
an
anxious
expression
on
her
pale
sweet
face
that
was
all
My
aunt
with
the
help
of
her
Trankvillitatin
pitched
into
me
as
before
and
as
before
reproachfully
whispered
in
my
ear
You
are
a
thief
sir
a
thief
But
I
took
no
notice
of
her
and
my
father
was
very
busy
and
occupied
with
his
writing
and
driving
all
over
the
place
and
did
not
want
to
hear
anything
One
day
passing
by
the
familiar
apple-tree
more
from
habit
than
anything
I
cast
a
furtive
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
little
spot
I
knew
so
well
and
it
suddenly
struck
me
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
surface
of
the
soil
that
concealed
our
treasure
as
though
there
were
a
little
protuberance
where
there
had
been
a
hollow
and
the
bits
of
rubbish
were
disarranged
What
does
that
mean
I
wondered
Can
someone
have
guessed
our
secret
and
dug
up
the
watch
I
had
to
make
certain
with
my
own
eyes
I
felt
of
course
the
most
complete
indifference
in
regard
to
the
watch
that
lay
rusting
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
but
was
not
prepared
to
let
anyone
else
make
use
of
it
And
so
next
day
I
got
up
before
dawn
again
and
arming
myself
with
a
knife
went
into
the
orchard
sought
out
the
marked
spot
under
the
apple-tree
began
digging
and
after
digging
a
hole
a
yard
deep
was
forced
to
the
conviction
that
the
watch
was
gone
that
someone
had
got
hold
of
it
taken
it
away
stolen
it
But
who
could
have
dug
it
up
except
David
Who
else
knew
where
it
was
I
filled
in
the
hole
and
went
back
to
the
house
I
felt
deeply
injured
Supposing
I
thought
that
David
needs
the
watch
to
save
his
future
wife
or
her
father
from
dying
of
starvation
Say
what
you
like
the
watch
was
worth
something
Why
did
he
not
come
to
me
and
say
'Brother
in
David
's
place
I
should
have
certainly
begun
by
saying
brother
'brother
I
need
money
you
have
none
I
know
but
let
me
make
use
of
that
watch
which
we
buried
together
under
the
old
apple-tree
It
is
of
no
use
to
anyone
and
I
shall
be
so
grateful
to
you
brother
With
what
joy
I
should
have
consented
But
to
act
secretly
treacherously
not
to
trust
his
friend
No
No
passion
no
necessity
would
justify
that
I
repeat
I
felt
horribly
injured
I
began
by
a
display
of
coldness
and
sulking
But
David
was
not
one
of
the
sort
to
notice
this
and
be
upset
by
it
I
began
dropping
hints
But
David
appeared
not
to
understand
my
hints
in
the
least
I
said
before
him
how
base
in
my
eyes
was
the
man
who
having
a
friend
and
understanding
all
that
was
meant
by
that
sacred
sentiment
friendship
was
yet
so
devoid
of
generosity
as
to
have
recourse
to
deception
as
though
it
were
possible
to
conceal
anything
As
I
uttered
these
last
words
I
laughed
scornfully
But
David
did
not
turn
a
hair
At
last
I
asked
him
straight
out
What
did
he
think
had
our
watch
gone
for
some
time
after
being
buried
in
the
earth
or
had
it
stopped
at
once
He
answered
me
The
devil
only
knows
What
a
thing
to
wonder
about
I
did
not
know
what
to
think
David
evidently
had
something
on
his
mind
but
not
the
abduction
of
the
watch
An
unexpected
incident
showed
me
his
innocence
One
day
I
came
home
by
a
side
lane
which
I
usually
avoided
as
the
house
in
which
my
enemy
Trankvillitatin
lodged
was
in
it
but
on
this
occasion
Fate
itself
led
me
that
way
Passing
the
open
window
of
an
eating-house
I
suddenly
heard
the
voice
of
our
servant
Vassily
a
young
man
of
free
and
easy
manners
a
lazy
fellow
and
a
scamp
as
my
father
called
him
but
also
a
great
conqueror
of
female
hearts
which
he
charmed
by
his
wit
his
dancing
and
his
playing
on
the
tambourine
And
what
do
you
suppose
they
've
been
up
to
said
Vassily
whom
I
could
not
see
but
heard
distinctly
he
was
most
likely
sitting
close
by
near
the
window
with
a
companion
over
the
steaming
tea
and
as
often
happens
with
people
in
a
closed
room
spoke
in
a
loud
voice
without
suspecting
that
anyone
passing
in
the
street
could
hear
every
word
They
buried
it
in
the
ground
Nonsense
muttered
another
voice
I
tell
you
they
did
our
young
gentlemen
are
extraordinary
Especially
that
Davidka
he
's
a
regular
Aesop
I
got
up
at
daybreak
and
went
to
the
window
I
looked
out
and
what
do
you
think
Our
two
little
dears
were
coming
along
the
orchard
bringing
that
same
watch
and
they
dug
a
hole
under
the
apple-tree
and
there
they
buried
it
as
though
it
had
been
a
baby
And
they
smoothed
the
earth
over
afterwards
upon
my
soul
they
did
the
young
rakes
Ah
plague
take
them
Vassily
's
companion
commented
Too
well
off
I
suppose
Well
did
you
dig
up
the
watch
To
be
sure
I
did
I
have
got
it
now
Only
it
wo
n't
do
to
show
it
for
a
time
There
's
been
no
end
of
a
fuss
over
it
Davidka
stole
it
that
very
night
from
under
our
old
lady
's
back
Oh
oh
I
tell
you
he
did
He
's
a
desperate
fellow
So
it
wo
n't
do
to
show
it
But
when
the
officers
come
down
I
shall
sell
it
or
stake
it
at
cards
I
did
n't
stay
to
hear
more
I
rushed
headlong
home
and
straight
to
David
Brother
I
began
brother
forgive
me
I
have
wronged
you
I
suspected
you
I
blamed
you
You
see
how
agitated
I
am
Forgive
me
What
's
the
matter
with
you
asked
David
Explain
I
suspected
that
you
had
dug
up
our
watch
under
the
apple-tree
The
watch
again
Why
is
n't
it
there
It
's
not
there
I
thought
you
had
taken
it
to
help
your
friends
And
it
was
all
Vassily
I
repeated
to
David
all
that
I
had
overheard
under
the
window
of
the
eating-house
But
how
to
describe
my
amazement
I
had
of
course
expected
David
to
be
indignant
but
I
had
not
for
a
moment
anticipated
the
effect
it
produced
on
him
I
had
hardly
finished
my
story
when
he
flew
into
an
indescribable
fury
David
who
had
always
taken
up
a
scornful
attitude
to
the
whole
vulgar
as
he
called
it
business
of
the
watch
David
who
had
more
than
once
declared
that
it
was
n't
worth
a
rotten
egg
jumped
up
from
his
seat
got
hot
all
over
ground
his
teeth
and
clenched
his
fists
We
ca
n't
let
this
pass
he
said
at
last
how
dare
he
take
someone
else
's
property
Wait
a
bit
I
'll
show
him
I
wo
n't
let
thieves
off
so
easily
I
confess
I
do
n't
understand
to
this
day
what
can
have
so
infuriated
David
Whether
he
had
been
irritated
before
and
Vassily
's
action
had
simply
poured
oil
on
the
flames
or
whether
my
suspicions
had
wounded
him
I
can
not
say
but
I
had
never
seen
him
in
such
excitement
I
stood
before
him
with
my
mouth
open
merely
wondering
how
it
was
that
his
breathing
was
so
hard
and
laboured
What
do
you
intend
to
do
I
asked
at
last
You
shall
see
after
dinner
when
your
father
lies
down
I
'll
find
this
scoffer
I
'll
talk
to
him
Well
thought
I
I
should
not
care
to
be
in
that
scoffer
's
shoes
What
will
happen
Merciful
heavens
XVII
This
is
what
did
happen
As
soon
as
that
drowsy
stifling
stillness
prevailed
which
to
this
day
lies
like
a
feather
bed
on
the
Russian
household
and
the
Russian
people
in
the
middle
of
the
day
after
dinner
is
eaten
David
went
to
the
servants
rooms
I
followed
on
his
heels
with
a
sinking
heart
and
called
Vassily
out
The
latter
was
at
first
unwilling
to
come
but
ended
by
obeying
and
following
us
into
the
garden
David
stood
close
in
front
of
him
Vassily
was
a
whole
head
taller
Vassily
Terentyev
my
comrade
began
in
a
firm
voice
six
weeks
ago
you
took
from
under
this
very
apple-tree
the
watch
we
hid
there
You
had
no
right
to
do
so
it
does
not
belong
to
you
Give
it
back
at
once
Vassily
was
taken
aback
but
at
once
recovered
himself
What
watch
What
are
you
talking
about
God
bless
you
I
have
no
watch
I
know
what
I
am
saying
and
do
n't
tell
lies
You
've
got
the
watch
give
it
back
I
've
not
got
your
watch
Then
how
was
it
that
in
the
eating-house
you
I
began
but
David
stopped
me
Vassily
Terentyev
he
pronounced
in
a
hollow
threatening
voice
we
know
for
a
fact
that
you
have
the
watch
You
are
told
honourably
to
give
it
back
and
if
you
do
n't
Vassily
sniggered
insolently
Then
what
will
you
do
with
me
then
Eh
What
will
we
do
We
will
both
fight
with
you
till
you
beat
us
or
we
beat
you
Vassily
laughed
Fight
That
's
not
for
a
gentleman
To
fight
with
a
servant
David
suddenly
caught
hold
of
Vassily
's
waistcoat
But
we
are
not
going
to
fight
you
with
our
fists
he
articulated
grinding
his
teeth
Understand
that
I
'll
give
you
a
knife
and
take
one
myself
And
then
we
shall
see
who
does
for
which
Alexey
he
began
commanding
me
run
for
my
big
knife
you
know
the
one
with
the
bone
handle
it
's
lying
on
the
table
and
the
other
's
in
my
pocket
Vassily
positively
collapsed
David
stood
holding
him
by
the
waistcoat
Mercy
on
us
Mercy
on
us
David
Yegoritch
he
muttered
tears
actually
came
into
his
eyes
What
do
you
mean
what
are
you
saying
Let
me
go
I
wo
n't
let
you
go
And
we
shall
have
no
mercy
on
you
If
you
get
away
from
us
today
we
shall
begin
again
to-morrow
Alyoshka
where's
the
knife
David
Yegoritch
wailed
Vassily
do
n't
commit
murder
What
are
you
doing
The
watch
I
certainly
I
was
joking
I
'll
give
it
to
you
this
minute
What
a
thing
to
be
sure
First
you
are
going
to
slit
Hrisanf
Lukitch
's
belly
then
mine
Let
me
go
David
Yegoritch
Kindly
take
the
watch
Only
do
n't
tell
your
papa
David
let
go
his
hold
of
Vassily
's
waistcoat
I
looked
into
his
face
certainly
not
only
Vassily
might
have
been
frightened
by
it
It
looked
so
weary
and
cold
and
angry
Vassily
dashed
into
the
house
and
promptly
returned
with
the
watch
in
his
hand
He
gave
it
to
David
without
a
word
and
only
on
going
back
into
the
house
exclaimed
aloud
in
the
doorway
Tfoo
here
's
a
go
He
still
looked
panic-stricken
David
tossed
his
head
and
walked
into
our
room
Again
I
followed
on
his
heels
A
Suvorov
He
's
a
regular
Suvorov
I
thought
to
myself
In
those
days
in
1801
Suvorov
was
our
great
national
hero
David
shut
the
door
after
him
put
the
watch
on
the
table
folded
his
arms
and
oh
wonder
laughed
Looking
at
him
I
laughed
too
What
a
wonderful
performance
he
began
We
ca
n't
get
rid
of
this
watch
anyway
It
's
bewitched
really
And
why
was
I
so
furious
about
it
Yes
why
I
repeated
You
ought
to
have
let
Vassily
keep
it
Well
no
interposed
David
That
's
nonsense
But
what
are
we
to
do
with
it
Yes
what
We
both
stared
at
the
watch
and
pondered
Adorned
with
a
chain
of
pale
blue
beads
the
luckless
Vassily
in
his
haste
had
not
removed
this
chain
which
belonged
to
him
it
was
calmly
doing
its
work
ticking
somewhat
irregularly
it
is
true
and
slowly
moving
its
copper
minute
hand
Shall
we
bury
it
again
Or
put
it
in
the
stove
I
suggested
at
last
Or
I
tell
you
what
should
n't
we
take
it
to
Latkin
No
answered
David
That
's
not
the
thing
I
know
what
they
have
set
up
a
committee
at
the
governor
's
office
and
are
collecting
subscriptions
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
of
Kasimov
The
town
has
been
burnt
to
ashes
with
all
its
churches
And
I
am
told
they
take
anything
not
only
bread
and
money
but
all
sorts
of
things
Shall
we
send
the
watch
there
Yes
yes
I
answered
A
splendid
idea
But
I
thought
that
since
your
friends
are
in
want
No
no
to
the
committee
the
Latkins
will
manage
without
it
To
the
committee
Well
if
it
is
to
be
the
committee
let
it
be
Only
I
imagine
we
must
write
something
to
the
governor
David
glanced
at
me
Do
you
think
so
Yes
of
course
there
is
no
need
to
write
much
But
just
a
few
words
For
instance
For
instance
begin
like
this
'Being
or
better
'Moved
by
'Moved
by
very
good
Then
we
must
say
'herewith
our
mite
'Mite
that
's
good
too
Well
take
your
pen
sit
down
and
write
fire
away
First
I
must
make
a
rough
copy
I
observed
All
right
a
rough
copy
only
write
write
And
meanwhile
I
will
clean
it
with
some
whitening
I
took
a
sheet
of
paper
mended
a
pen
but
before
I
had
time
to
write
at
the
top
of
the
sheet
To
His
Excellency
the
illustrious
Prince
our
governer
was
at
that
time
Prince
X
I
stopped
struck
by
the
extraordinary
uproar
which
had
suddenly
arisen
in
the
house
David
noticed
the
hubbub
too
and
he
too
stopped
holding
the
watch
in
his
left
hand
and
a
rag
with
whitening
in
his
right
We
looked
at
each
other
What
was
that
shrill
cry
It
was
my
aunt
shrieking
and
that
It
was
my
father
's
voice
hoarse
with
anger
The
watch
the
watch
bawled
someone
surely
Trankvillitatin
We
heard
the
thud
of
feet
the
creak
of
the
floor
a
regular
rabble
running
moving
straight
upon
us
I
was
numb
with
terror
and
David
was
as
white
as
chalk
but
he
looked
proud
as
an
eagle
Vassily
the
scoundrel
has
betrayed
us
he
whispered
through
his
teeth
The
door
was
flung
wide
open
and
my
father
in
his
dressing
gown
and
without
his
cravat
my
aunt
in
her
dressing
jacket
Trankvillitatin
Vassily
Yushka
another
boy
and
the
cook
Agapit
all
burst
into
the
room
Scoundrels
shouted
my
father
gasping
for
breath
At
last
we
have
found
you
out
And
seeing
the
watch
in
David
's
hands
Give
it
here
yelled
my
father
give
me
the
watch
But
David
without
uttering
a
word
dashed
to
the
open
window
and
leapt
out
of
it
into
the
yard
and
then
off
into
the
street
Accustomed
to
imitate
my
paragon
in
everything
I
jumped
out
too
and
ran
after
David
Catch
them
Hold
them
we
heard
a
medley
of
frantic
shouts
behind
us
But
we
were
already
racing
along
the
street
bareheaded
David
in
advance
and
I
a
few
paces
behind
him
and
behind
us
the
clatter
and
uproar
of
pursuit
Many
years
have
passed
since
the
date
of
these
events
I
have
reflected
over
them
more
than
once
and
to
this
day
I
can
no
more
understand
the
cause
of
the
fury
that
took
possession
of
my
father
who
had
so
lately
been
so
sick
of
the
watch
that
he
had
forbidden
it
to
be
mentioned
in
his
hearing
than
I
can
David
's
rage
at
its
having
been
stolen
by
Vassily
One
is
tempted
to
imagine
that
there
was
some
mysterious
power
connected
with
it
Vassily
had
not
betrayed
us
as
David
assumed
he
was
not
capable
of
it
he
had
been
too
much
scared
it
was
simply
that
one
of
our
maids
had
seen
the
watch
in
his
hands
and
had
promptly
informed
our
aunt
The
fat
was
in
the
fire
And
so
we
darted
down
the
street
keeping
to
the
very
middle
of
it
The
passers-by
who
met
us
stopped
or
stepped
aside
in
amazement
I
remember
a
retired
major
craned
out
of
the
window
of
his
flat
and
crimson
in
the
face
his
bulky
person
almost
overbalancing
hallooed
furiously
Shouts
of
Stop
hold
them
still
resounded
behind
us
David
ran
flourishing
the
watch
over
his
head
and
from
time
to
time
leaping
into
the
air
I
jumped
too
whenever
he
did
Where
I
shouted
to
David
seeing
that
he
was
turning
into
a
side
street
and
I
turned
after
him
To
the
Oka
he
shouted
To
throw
it
into
the
water
into
the
river
To
the
devil
Stop
stop
they
shouted
behind
But
we
were
already
flying
along
the
side
street
already
a
whiff
of
cool
air
was
meeting
us
and
the
river
lay
before
us
and
the
steep
muddy
descent
to
it
and
the
wooden
bridge
with
a
train
of
waggons
stretching
across
it
and
a
garrison
soldier
with
a
pike
beside
the
flagstaff
soldiers
used
to
carry
pikes
in
those
days
David
reached
the
bridge
and
darted
by
the
soldier
who
tried
to
give
him
a
blow
on
the
legs
with
his
pike
and
hit
a
passing
calf
David
instantly
leaped
on
to
the
parapet
he
uttered
a
joyful
exclamation
Something
white
something
blue
gleamed
in
the
air
and
shot
into
the
water
it
was
the
silver
watch
with
Vassily
's
blue
bead
chain
flying
into
the
water
But
then
something
incredible
happened
After
the
watch
David
's
feet
flew
upwards
and
head
foremost
with
his
hands
thrust
out
before
him
and
the
lapels
of
his
jacket
fluttering
he
described
an
arc
in
the
air
as
frightened
frogs
jump
on
hot
days
from
a
high
bank
into
a
pond
and
instantly
vanished
behind
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
and
then
flop
and
a
tremendous
splash
below
What
happened
to
me
I
am
utterly
unable
to
describe
I
was
some
steps
from
David
when
he
leapt
off
the
parapet
but
I
do
n't
even
remember
whether
I
cried
out
I
do
n't
think
that
I
was
even
frightened
I
was
stunned
stupefied
I
could
not
stir
hand
or
foot
People
were
running
and
hustling
round
me
some
of
them
seemed
to
be
people
I
knew
I
had
a
sudden
glimpse
of
Trofimitch
the
soldier
with
the
pike
dashed
off
somewhere
the
horses
and
the
waggons
passed
by
quickly
tossing
up
their
noses
covered
with
string
Then
everything
was
green
before
my
eyes
and
someone
gave
me
a
violent
shove
on
my
head
and
all
down
my
back
I
fell
fainting
I
remember
that
I
came
to
myself
afterwards
and
seeing
that
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
me
went
up
to
the
parapet
but
not
on
the
side
that
David
had
jumped
It
seemed
terrible
to
me
to
approach
it
and
as
I
began
gazing
into
the
dark
blue
muddy
swollen
river
I
remember
that
I
noticed
a
boat
moored
to
the
bridge
not
far
from
the
bank
and
several
people
in
the
boat
and
one
of
these
who
was
drenched
all
over
and
sparkling
in
the
sun
bending
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
was
pulling
something
out
of
the
water
something
not
very
big
oblong
a
dark
thing
which
at
first
I
took
to
be
a
portmanteau
or
a
basket
but
when
I
looked
more
intently
I
saw
that
the
thing
was
David
Then
in
violent
excitement
I
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
and
ran
towards
the
boat
pushing
my
way
through
the
people
but
when
I
had
run
down
to
it
I
was
overcome
with
timidity
and
began
looking
about
me
Among
the
people
who
were
crowding
about
it
I
recognised
Trankvillitatin
the
cook
Agapit
with
a
boot
in
his
hand
Yushka
Vassily
the
wet
and
shining
man
held
David
's
body
under
the
arms
drew
him
out
of
the
boat
and
laid
him
on
his
back
on
the
mud
of
the
bank
Both
David's
hands
were
raised
to
the
level
of
his
face
as
though
he
were
trying
to
hide
himself
from
strange
eyes
he
did
not
stir
but
lay
as
though
standing
at
attention
with
his
heels
together
and
his
stomach
out
His
face
was
greenish
his
eyes
were
staring
and
water
was
dripping
from
his
hair
The
wet
man
who
had
pulled
him
out
a
factory
hand
judging
by
his
clothes
began
describing
how
he
had
done
it
shivering
with
cold
and
continually
throwing
back
his
hair
from
his
forehead
as
he
talked
He
told
his
story
in
a
very
proper
and
painstaking
way
What
do
I
see
friends
This
young
lad
go
flying
from
the
bridge
Well
I
ran
down
at
once
the
way
of
the
current
for
I
knew
he
had
fallen
into
mid-stream
and
it
would
carry
him
under
the
bridge
and
there
talk
of
the
devil
I
looked
something
like
a
fur
cap
was
floating
and
it
was
his
head
Well
quick
as
thought
I
was
in
the
water
and
caught
hold
of
him
It
did
n't
need
much
cleverness
for
that
Two
or
three
words
of
approval
were
audible
in
the
crowd
You
ought
to
have
something
to
warm
you
now
Come
along
and
we
will
have
a
drink
said
someone
But
at
this
point
all
at
once
somebody
pushed
forward
abruptly
it
was
Vassily
What
are
you
doing
good
Christians
he
cried
tearfully
We
must
bring
him
to
by
rolling
him
it
's
our
young
gentleman
Roll
him
roll
him
shouted
the
crowd
which
was
continually
growing
Hang
him
up
by
the
feet
it
's
the
best
way
Lay
him
with
his
stomach
on
the
barrel
and
roll
him
backwards
and
forwards
Take
him
lads
Do
n't
dare
to
touch
him
put
in
the
soldier
with
the
pike
He
must
be
taken
to
the
police
station
Low
brute
Trofimitch
's
bass
voice
rang
out
But
he
is
alive
I
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
and
almost
with
horror
I
had
put
my
face
near
to
his
So
that
is
what
the
drowned
look
like
I
thought
with
a
sinking
heart
And
all
at
once
I
saw
David
's
lips
stir
and
a
little
water
oozed
from
them
At
once
I
was
pushed
back
and
dragged
away
everyone
rushed
up
to
him
Roll
him
roll
him
voices
clamoured
No
no
stay
shouted
Vassily
Take
him
home
Take
him
home
Take
him
home
Trankvillitatin
himself
chimed
in
We
will
bring
him
to
We
can
see
better
there
Vassily
went
on
I
have
liked
him
from
that
day
Lads
have
n't
you
a
sack
If
not
we
must
take
him
by
his
head
and
his
feet
Stay
Here
's
a
sack
Lay
him
on
it
Catch
hold
Start
That
's
fine
As
though
he
were
driving
in
a
chaise
A
few
minutes
later
David
borne
in
triumph
on
the
sack
crossed
the
threshold
of
our
house
again
He
was
undressed
and
put
to
bed
He
began
to
give
signs
of
life
while
in
the
street
moaned
moved
his
hands
Indoors
he
came
to
himself
completely
But
as
soon
as
all
anxiety
for
his
life
was
over
and
there
was
no
reason
to
worry
about
him
indignation
got
the
upper
hand
again
everyone
shunned
him
as
though
he
were
a
leper
May
God
chastise
him
May
God
chastise
him
my
aunt
shrieked
to
be
heard
all
over
the
house
Get
rid
of
him
somehow
Porfiry
Petrovitch
or
he
will
do
some
mischief
beyond
all
bearing
Upon
my
word
he
is
a
viper
he
is
possessed
with
a
devil
Trankvillitatin
chimed
in
The
wickedness
the
wickedness
cackled
my
aunt
going
close
to
the
door
of
our
room
so
that
David
might
be
sure
to
hear
her
First
of
all
he
stole
the
watch
and
then
flung
it
into
the
water
as
though
to
say
no
one
should
get
it
Everyone
everyone
was
indignant
David
I
asked
him
as
soon
as
we
were
left
alone
what
did
you
do
it
for
So
you
are
after
that
too
he
answered
in
a
voice
that
was
still
weak
his
lips
were
blue
and
he
looked
as
though
he
were
swollen
all
over
What
did
I
do
But
what
did
you
jump
into
the
water
for
Jump
I
lost
my
balance
on
the
parapet
that
was
all
If
I
had
known
how
to
swim
I
