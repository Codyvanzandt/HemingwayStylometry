Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
not
depressed
by
that
being
a
bachelor
and
generally
unexact
ing
he
cared
little
about
the
conveniences
of
life
and
was
satisfied
with
the
fact
that
he
had
a
little
place
in
which
he
could
at
need
find
shelter
from
cold
and
bad
weather
His
house
was
managed
by
the
housekeeper
Makedonia
a
middle-aged
woman
very
zealous
and
even
honest
but
with
an
unlucky
hand
nothing
she
did
succeeded
the
crockery
was
broken
the
linen
was
torn
the
food
was
uncooked
or
burnt
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
used
to
call
her
Caligula
Having
a
natural
bent
for
hospitality
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
liked
to
have
visitors
in
his
house
and
to
regale
them
in
spite
of
the
narrowness
of
his
means
He
was
particularly
active
in
his
efforts
when
Boris
Andreyitch
visited
him
but
thanks
to
Makedonia
who
almost
flew
off
her
legs
at
each
step
in
her
eagerness
to
please
poor
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
festive
fare
was
al
ways
a
failure
and
for
the
most
part
did
not
get
further
than
a
piece
of
stale
dried
sturgeon
and
a
glass
of
vodka
which
he
himself
de
scribed
very
justly
when
he
said
that
it
was
capital
against
the
stomach
After
their
walk
the
two
friends
would
return
to
Boris
Andrey
itch
's
house
and
dine
in
leisurely
fashion
After
eating
as
though
he
had
had
no
lunch
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
retire
to
some
secluded
nook
and
sleep
for
two
or
three
hours
while
Boris
Andreyitch
would
read
foreign
magazines
In
II
the
evening
the
friends
met
again
so
great
was
their
friendship
Sometimes
they
sat
down
to
play
preference
sometimes
they
simply
talked
as
in
the
morning
Occasionally
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
would
take
a
guitar
from
the
wall
and
sing
in
a
rather
agreeable
tenor
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
was
very
fond
of
music
far
more
so
than
Boris
Andreyitch
though
the
latter
could
not
utter
the
name
of
Beethoven
without
a
dis
play
of
enthusiasm
and
was
always
intending
to
order
a
piano
from
Moscow
In
moments
of
melancholy
or
depression
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
had
the
habit
of
singing
a
song
connected
with
the
period
of
his
service
in
the
regiment
With
peculiar
feeling
and
a
little
through
his
nose
he
would
deliver
the
following
verse
No
Frenchman
ever
cooks
for
us
A
soldier
gets
our
meals
for
us
No
glorious
Rodez
playo
for
us
No
Catalini
sings
for
us
A
bugler
greets
the
dawn
for
us
A
sergeant
brings
reports
to
us
Boris
Andreyitch
would
sometimes
second
him
but
his
voice
was
disagreeable
and
not
always
in
tune
At
ten
o'clock
and
sometimes
earlier
the
friends
parted
And
the
same
thing
began
again
next
day
Sitting
one
day
as
usual
a
little
on
one
side
facing
Boris
Andreyitch
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
looked
at
him
rather
intently
and
brought
out
in
a
dreamy
voice
There
's
one
thing
I
wonder
at
Boris
An
dreyitch
What
's
that
inquired
the
latter
Why
this
You
're
young
intelligent
well
educated
What
induces
you
to
live
in
the
country
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
at
his
neighbour
in
surprise
Why
you
know
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
he
said
at
last
that
if
it
were
not
for
my
circum
stances
circumstances
compel
me
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitcli
Circumstances
Your
circumstances
are
nothing
to
matter
so
far
With
your
estate
you
can
get
along
all
right
You
should
go
into
the
service
And
after
a
brief
pause
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
added
If
I
were
you
I
should
go
into
the
Uhlans
The
Uhlans
Why
into
the
Uhlans
3
Oh
I
fancy
it
would
be
more
suitable
for
you
to
be
in
the
Uhlans
But
excuse
me
you
were
in
the
Hussars
were
n't
you
I
Of
course'I
was
in
the
Hussars
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
said
eagerly
And
in
what
a
regi
ment
You
would
n't
find
another
regiment
like
it
in
the
whole
world
It
was
a
golden
regiment
My
superior
officers
my
comrades
what
fellows
they
were
But
you
I
don't
know
You
ought
to
be
in
Hie
Uhlans
to
my
thinking
You
're
fair
you
've
a
slim
fig
ure
it
's
all
in
keeping
But
excuse
me
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
You
forget
that
by
the
Army
regulations
I
should
have
to
begin
as
an
Ensign
At
my
age
that
would
be
rather
difficult
I
think
it
's
forbidden
in
fact
That
's
true
observed
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
and
he
became
downcast
Well
in
that
case
you
should
get
married
he
pronounced
sud
denly
raising
his
head
What
queer
ideas
you
've
got
to-day
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
exclaimed
Boris
Andreyitch
WTiy
queer
What
's
the
use
of
living
like
this
really
What
are
you
waiting
for
You're
only
losing
lime
I
want
to
know
what
ad
vantage
it
will
be
to
you
not
to
get
married
But
it
's
not
a
question
of
advantage
Boris
Andreyitch
was
beginning
No
excuse
me
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
inter
rupted
him
suddenly
growing
excited
I
can't
understand
why
it
is
young
men
are
so
afraid
to
be
married
nowadays
I
simply
ca
n't
under
stand
it
Never
mind
my
not
being
married
Boris
Andreyitch
I
wanted
to
be
perhaps
and
made
an
offer
but
they
showed
me
out
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
pointed
upwards
and
out
wards
with
the
finger
of
his
right
hand
towards
Boris
Andreyitch
But
with
your
property
how
is
it
you
're
not
married
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
intently
at
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Is
it
amusing
to
live
as
a
bachelor
Pyoti
Vassilyitch
went
on
It
's
nothing
to
boast
of
It
's
a
poor
sort
of
fun
Really
the
young
men
of
to-day
are
a
wonder
to
me
And
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
knocked
his
pipe
against
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
an
air
of
vexation
and
blew
violently
into
the
mouthpiece
But
who
has
told
you
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
that
I
do
n't
intend
to
get
married
Boris
Andreyitch
brought
out
slowly
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
remained
motionless
as
he
was
with
his
fingers
in
his
spangled
maroon
velvet
tobacco
pouch
Boris
Andreyitch
's
v
ords
astonished
him
Yes
Boris
Andreyitch
went
on
I
'm
ready
to
be
married
Find
me
a
bride
and
I
'll
marry
Really
Really
No
I
say
upon
your
word
What
a
fellow
you
are
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Upon
my
word
I
'm
not
joking
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
filled
his
pipe
Well
you
shall
see
then
Boris
Andreyitch
We
'll
find
you
a
bride
Very
good
replied
Boris
Andreyitch
but
tell
me
really
what
do
you
want
to
marry
me
for
Why
because
as
I
told
you
you
're
not
fitted
for
doing
nothing
hke
this
Boris
Andreyitch
smiled
i6
It
has
always
seemed
to
me
on
the
contrary
that
I
was
a
master
at
it
You
misunderstand
me
said
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
and
he
changed
the
conversation
Two
days
later
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
arrived
at
his
neighbour
's
not
in
his
usual
sack
overcoat
but
in
a
frock-coat
the
colour
of
a
raven's
wing
with
a
high
waist
minute
buttons
and
long
sleeves
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
moustaches
looked
almost
black
from
wax
and
his
hair
curled
tightly
in
front
in
the
form
of
two
long
sausages
glistened
with
pomatum
A
big
velvet
cravat
with
a
satin
ribbon
tightly
compressed
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
neck
and
gave
a
solemn
im
mobility
and
festive
dignity
to
the
whole
of
the
upper
part
of
his
person
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
get-up
en
quired
Boris
Andreyitch
The
meaning
of
this
get-up
replied
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
sinking
into
an
armchair
but
not
with
his
usual
carelessness
is
that
you
must
order
the
carriage
we
are
going
out
Whereto
To
see
the
bride
What
bride
Why
have
you
forgotten
already
what
we
were
talking
about
three
days
ago
Boris
Andreyitch
laughed
though
he
was
in
wardly
disturbed
Upon
my
word
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
why
that
was
only
a
joke
A
joke
How
was
it
then
that
you
swore
at
the
time
that
you
were
not
joking
No
ex
cuse
me
Boris
Andreyitch
you
must
keep
your
word
I
've
taken
steps
already
Boris
Andreyitch
was
still
more
disturbed
'/What
steps
do
you
mean
he
asked
Oh
do
n't
worry
yourself
What
do
you
imagine
I
have
only
warned
a
neighbour
of
ours
a
very
charming
lady
that
we
intend
to
call
on
her
to-day
Who
is
this
neighbour
Wait
a
bit
and
you
will
know
Come
you
must
first
dress
and
order
the
horses
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
round
him
irreso
lutely
Really
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
what
possessed
you
Look
at
the
weather
The
weather
does
n't
matter
it
's
always
like
that
i8
And
is
it
far
to
drive
About
ten
miles
Boris
Andreyitch
was
silent
But
let
us
at
least
have
lunch
first
Lunch
certainly
if
you
like
Do
you
know
what
you
run
and
dress
now
I
'll
arrange
it
all
while
you
are
gone
a
drop
of
vodka
a
morsel
of
caviare
and
we
shall
be
fed
at
the
little
widow
's
You
need
n't
be
anxious
about
that
You
do
n't
say
she
's
a
widow
Boris
An
dreyitch
asked
turning
round
on
his
way
to
the
door
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
shook
his
head
There
you
will
see
you
will
see
Boris
Andreyitch
went
out
and
shut
the
door
after
him
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
left
alone
ordered
the
lunch
and
the
carriage
Boris
Andreyitch
spent
a
considerable
time
over
his
toilet
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
with
a
slight
frown
and
a
melancholy
air
was
already
drink
ing
his
second
glass
of
vodka
when
Boris
Andreyitch
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
study
He
had
taken
trouble
over
dressing
He
had
put
on
a
full
fashionably
cut
black
frock-coat
the
dark
mass
of
which
contrasted
agreeably
with
the
faint
brilliance
of
the
light-grey
trou
sers
a
low
black
cravat
and
a
handsome
dark
blue
waistcoat
a
gold
chain
hooked
into
the
lowest
buttonhole
modestly
vanished
into
the
side
pocket
the
thin
high
boots
creaked
in
a
gentlemanly
way
and
at
Boris
Andreyitch's
entrance
the
air
was
filled
with
a
scent
of
Ess
bouquet
combined
with
the
smell
of
fresh
linen
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
could
only
articulate
Ah
and
pick
up
his
cap
Boris
And
rey
itch
drew
a
grey
kid
glove
on
to
his
left
hand
after
first
blowing
into
it
then
with
the
same
hand
he
nervously
poured
himself
out
a
quarter
of
a
glass
of
vodka
and
drank
it
off
than
he
took
his
hat
and
went
with
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
out
into
the
entry
I
'm
doing
this
entirely
on
your
account
said
Boris
Andreyitch
as
he
got
into
the
car
riage
Supposing
it
is
on
my
account
said
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
who
was
evidently
impressed
by
Boris
Andreyitch
's
elegant
appearance
you
will
perhaps
thank
me
for
it
yourself
And
he
told
the
coachman
where
to
drive
and
how
to
get
there
The
carriage
drove
off
We
are
going
to
see
Sofya
Kirillovna
Zad
nyeprovskoy
observed
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
after
a
rather
prolonged
interval
in
the
course
of
which
the
two
friends
had
sat
motionless
as
though
turned
to
stone
Have
you
heard
of
her
I
believe
I
have
answered
Boris
Andrey
itch
Why
have
you
chosen
her
for
a
bride
for
me
And
why
not
She
is
a
woman
of
excel
lent
understanding
with
property
with
the
manners
one
may
say
of
Petersburg
But
you
can
have
a
look
at
her
That
does
n't
bind
you
to
anything
you
know
I
should
hope
not
retorted
Boris
Andrey
itch
and
how
old
is
she
Twenty-five
or
seven
not
more
in
her
very
prime
as
they
say
It
was
not
ten
miles
to
Madame
Zadnyeprov
skoy
's
but
a
good
sixteen
and
a
half
so
that
Boris
Andreyitch
was
fairly
frozen
by
the
end
of
the
drive
and
kept
hiding
his
reddening
nose
in
the
beaver
collar
of
his
greatcoat
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
not
afraid
of
cold
as
a
rule
and
especially
not
so
when
he
was
dressed
in
his
holiday
dress
then
he
was
more
liable
to
get
into
a
perspiration
Madame
Zad
nyeprovskoy
's
homestead
consisted
of
a
little
new
white
house
with
a
green
roof
of
suburban
style
that
looked
like
a
summer
villa
and
a
little
garden
and
courtyard
Such
villas
may
frequently
be
met
with
near
Moscow
in
the
provinces
they
are
not
so
common
It
was
evi
dent
that
the
lady
had
settled
here
only
re
cently
The
friends
got
out
of
the
carriage
They
were
met
on
the
steps
by
a
footman
in
pea-green
trousers
and
a
grey
swallowtail
coat
with
rounded
edges
and
buttons
with
a
crest
on
them
in
the
entry
which
was
fairly
neat
though
it
had
a
box
seat
in
it
they
were
met
by
another
similar
footman
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
bade
him
take
his
name
and
Boris
Andreyitch's
to
his
mistress
The
footman
did
not
go
to
his
mistress
but
answered
that
he
had
orders
to
show
them
in
They
went
in
and
through
a
dining-room
in
which
a
canary
was
singing
in
a
deafening
way
walked
into
a
drawing-room
full
of
fashionable
Russian
shop-made
furniture
very
ingeniously
constructed
and
with
chairs
bent
in
all
direc
tions
to
provide
comfort
for
the
sitter
and
really
very
uncomfortable
Two
minutes
had
not
elapsed
when
the
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
was
heard
in
the
next
room
the
curtain
over
the
door
was
raised
and
the
lady
of
the
house
walked
with
rapid
steps
into
the
drawing-room
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
made
a
bow
and
a
scrape
and
introduced
Boris
Andreyitch
I
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
have
long
wished
to
the
lady
responded
in
a
free-and-easy
tone
scanning
him
with
a
rapid
glance
I
am
very
grateful
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
for
bringing
me
such
an
agreeable
acquaintance
please
sit
down
And
with
a
rustle
of
her
skirts
the
lady
sat
down
on
a
little
low
sofa
leaned
back
in
it
stretched
out
her
feet
in
charming
little
boots
and
folded
her
arms
Her
dress
was
of
green
glace
silk
with
whitish
lights
on
it
made
with
several
rows
of
flounces
Boris
Andreyitch
sat
down
on
the
low
chair
facing
her
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
a
little
further
away
Conversation
followed
Boris
Andrey
itch
scrutinised
Sofya
Kirillovna
attentively
She
was
a
tall
well
made
woman
with
a
sUm
waist
dark
and
rather
handsome
The
ex
pression
of
her
face
and
particularly
of
her
big
and
shining
eyes
turned
up
at
the
corners
like
a
Chinaman
's
betrayed
a
strange
mixture
of
boldness
and
timidity
and
could
not
have
been
called
natural
She
would
screw
up
her
eyes
and
then
suddenly
open
them
wide
a
smile
which
tried
to
seem
careless
was
continually
playing
on
her
lips
All
Sofya
Kirillovna's
movements
were
very
free
almost
abrupt
Her
appearance
attracted
Boris
Andreyitch
how
ever
except
that
he
was
disagreeably
impressed
by
the
way
her
hair
was
parted
on
one
side
which
gave
a
saucy
and
boyish
air
to
her
face
moreover
to
his
thinking
she
spoke
Russian
with
excessive
purity
and
correctness
Boris
Andreyitch
shared
Pushkin
's
opinion
that
one
can
no
more
love
the
Russian
language
without
a
grammatical
mistake
than
rosy
lips
without
a
smile
In
short
Sofya
Kirillovna
belonged
to
that
class
of
women
who
are
spoken
of
by
polite
men
as
ladies
who
can
hold
their
own
by
husbands
as
formidable
women
and
by
old
bachelors
as
festive
old
girls
At
first
the
conversation
touched
upon
the
extreme
dullness
of
country
life
There
's
simply
not
a
living
soul
here
sim
ply
no
one
to
say
a
word
to
said
Sofya
Kiril
lovna
pronouncing
the
letter
s
with
peculiar
distinctness
I
ca
n't
make
out
the
people
liv
ing
here
and
those
she
added
with
a
grimace
'with
whom
it
would
be
pleasant
to
be
ac
quainted
they
do
n't
call
they
leave
us
poor
things
to
our
cheerless
solitude
Boris
Andreyitch
made
a
slight
bow
and
mut
tered
some
awkward
apology
while
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
merely
glanced
at
him
as
though
to
say
Well
what
did
I
tell
you
She
's
not
at
a
Toss
for
a
word
you
see
Do
you
smoke
asked
Sofya
Kirillovna
Yes
But
Please
do
I
smoke
myself
And
as
she
said
these
words
the
widow
took
a
rather
large
silver
cigar
case
from
the
little
table
took
a
cigarette
from
it
and
offered
it
to
her
guests
Each
took
a
cigarette
Sofya
Kirillovna
rang
the
bell
and
told
a
boy
with
a
broad
expanse
of
red
waistcoat
to
bring
a
light
The
boy
brought
a
wax
candle
on
a
crystal
tray
The
cigarettes
were
lighted
Now
for
instance
you
would
n't
believe
the
widow
went
on
lightly
turning
her
head
and
puffing
a
thin
coil
of
smoke
upwards
there
are
people
here
who
think
ladies
ought
n't
to
smoke
and
as
for
riding
on
horseback
God
forbid
They
would
simply
stone
one
Yes
she
added
after
a
brief
pause
anything
that
departs
from
the
common
level
everything
that
breaks
the
rules
of
an
artificial
decorum
is
sub
jected
to
the
severest
censure
here
The
young
ladies
in
particular
are
angry
about
that
observed
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Yes
replied
the
widow
They
are
the
chief
sufferers
I
do
n't
know
them
at
all
though
scandal
wo
n't
allow
them
to
visit
my
solitary
retreat
And
are
n't
you
dull
asked
Boris
Andrey
itch
Dull
No
I
read
And
when
I'm
tired
of
books
I
dream
I
tell
my
future
and
put
questions
to
my
fate
You
tell
your
fortune
on
cards
asked
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
The
widow
gave
a
condescending
smile
Why
should
n't
I
tell
my
fortune
I
'm
old
enough
for
that
Oh
what
next
retorted
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Sofya
Kirillovna
screwed
up
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
Let
us
drop
that
subject
though
she
said
and
turned
with
alacrity
to
Boris
Andreyitch
Listen
Monsieur
Vyazovnin
I
am
con
vinced
that
you
are
interested
in
Russian
litera
ture
Yes
Of
course
Vyazovnin
was
fond
of
reading
but
he
had
read
little
in
Russian
and
without
interest
The
more
modern
literature
especially
was
unknown
to
him
he
had
stopped
at
Pushkiti
Tell
me
please
why
has
Marlinsky
fallen
into
such
disfavour
of
late
To
my
thinking
it
's
extremely
unjust
what
is
your
view
of
him
Marlinsky
is
a
writer
of
merit
of
course
Boris
Andreyitch
replied
He
is
a
poet
he
carries
the
imagination
away
into
a
world
of
enchantment
and
marvels
but
of
late
they
've
taken
to
describing
every
day
life
and
upon
my
word
what
good
is
tViere
in
this
everyday
life
here
on
earth
And
Sofya
Kirillovna
waved
her
hand
round
her
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
significantly
at
Sofya
Kirillovna
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
I
think
there
's
a
great
deal
that
's
good
just
here
he
said
with
peculiar
emphasis
on
the
last
word
Sofya
Kirillovna
suddenly
broke
into
an
ab
rupt
laugh
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
as
suddenly
raised
his
head
thought
a
moment
and
fell
to
smoking
again
The
conversation
went
on
in
the
same
style
till
dinner
time
continually
changing
from
one
subject
to
another
which
does
not
happen
when
a
conversation
becomes
really
interesting
Amongst
other
things
they
touched
upon
mar
riage
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
the
position
of
women
in
general
Sofya
Kiril
lovna
vigorously
attacked
marriage
became
ex
cited
at
last
and
beginning
to
feel
hot
ex
pressed
herself
very
eloquently
though
her
listeners
scarcely
contradicted
her
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
she
loved
IMarlinsky
She
could
too
resort
on
occasion
to
the
fine
flowers
of
the
most
up-to-date
style
The
words
artistic
aestheticism
conditioned
by
were
continuously
dropping
from
her
lips
What
can
be
of
more
value
to
a
woman
than
freedom
freedom
of
thought
of
feeling
of
action
she
exclaimed
at
last
But
excuse
me
said
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
whose
face
was
beginning
to
assume
a
disatis
fied
expression
what
does
woman
want
free
dom
for
what
will
she
do
with
it
How
can
you
ask
'what
Why
a
man
wants
it
to
your
thinking
does
n't
he
To
be
sure
you
gentlemen
But
a
man
does
n't
want
it
either
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
interrupted
her
again
How
do
you
mean
does
n't
want
it
Wh
just
what
I
say
that
he
does
n't
What
use
to
a
man
is
the
freedom
you
praise
so
A
man
who
is
free
it
's
a
thing
we
all
know
is
either
bored
or
plays
the
fool
Then
observed
Sofya
Kirillovna
with
an
ironical
smile
you
are
bored
because
know
ing
you
to
be
a
sensible
man
I
ca
n't
suppose
that
you
play
the
fool
as
you
say
Both
happen
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
answered
calmly
Well
that
's
charming
However
I
ought
to
be
grateful
to
your
boredom
for
giving
me
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
here
to-day
And
satisfied
with
the
tactful
turn
of
her
phrase
the
lady
sank
back
a
little
and
pro
nounced
in
an
undertone
Your
friend
I
see
is
fond
of
paradoxes
Monsieur
Vyazovnin
I
have
n't
noticed
it
replied
Boris
Andrey
itch
What
am
I
fond
of
asked
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
Paradoxes
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
looked
into
Sofya
Kiril
lovna
's
eyes
and
m.ade
her
no
reply
but
thought
to
himself
I
know
what
you
're
fond
of
The
boy
with
the
red
waistcoat
came
in
and
announced
that
dinner
was
ready
Will
you
come
then
said
the
lady
get
ting
up
from
the
sofa
and
they
all
went
into
the
dining-room
The
two
friends
did
not
like
the
dinner
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
hungry
when
he
rose
from
the
table
though
there
were
many
dishes
while
Boris
Andreyitch
who
was
fond
of
good
fare
was
dissatisfied
though
the
food
was
served
under
dish
covers
and
the
plates
had
been
heated
The
wines
too
were
poor
in
spite
of
the
magnificent
labels
adorned
with
gold
and
silver
on
the
bottles
Sofya
Kiril
lovna
talked
without
ceasing
though
from
time
to
time
she
cast
expressive
glances
at
the
serv
ants
who
were
handing
the
dishes
and
she
drank
a
fair
amount
of
wine
remarking
that
in
England
all
the
ladies
drank
wine
while
here
even
that
was
considered
improper
After
din
ner
the
lady
invited
them
back
into
the
drawing
room
and
asked
them
which
they
preferred
tea
or
coffee
Boris
Andreyitch
preferred
tea
and
after
emptying
his
cup
inwardly
regretted
that
he
had
not
asked
for
coffee
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
chose
coffee
and
after
emptying
it
asked
for
tea
tasted
it
and
put
the
cup
back
on
the
tray
The
lady
settled
herself
in
her
seat
lighted
a
cigarette
and
was
evidently
not
disinclined
to
enter
on
the
liveliest
conversation
her
eyes
glowed
and
her
dark
cheeks
w^ere
flushed
but
her
guests
responded
listlessly
to
her
sallies
were
more
absorbed
by
their
smoking
and
judg
ing
from
the
looks
they
bent
on
the
corners
of
the
room
were
thinking
of
taking
leave
Boris
Andreyitch
however
would
probably
have
consented
to
stay
till
evening
he
had
just
entered
upon
a
skirmish
with
Sofya
Kiril
lovna
on
her
asking
coquettishly
whether
he
was
not
surprised
at
her
living
alone
without
a
companion
but
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
unmis
takably
in
a
hurry
to
go
home
He
got
up
went
out
into
the
entry
and
ordered
the
horses
When
at
last
the
two
friends
began
saying
good-bye
and
their
hostess
tried
to
keep
them
and
politely
upbraided
them
for
staying
so
short
a
time
Boris
Andreyitch
by
the
irresolute
in
clination
of
his
person
and
the
simpering
ex
pression
of
his
face
did
at
least
show
that
her
reproaches
had
some
effect
on
him
but
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
kept
muttering
quite
impossible
time
to
be
going
work
to
do
it
's
moonlight
now
and
obstinately
backed
towards
the
door
Sofya
Kirillovna
made
them
promise
however
THE
two
FRIENDS
that
they
would
come
again
in
a
few
days
and
held
out
her
hand
to
them
for
an
English
shake
hands
Boris
Andreyitch
alone
availed
himself
of
the
offer
and
pressed
her
fingers
rather
warmly
She
screwed
up
her
eyes
and
smiled
At
that
instant
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
already
putting
on
his
greatcoat
in
the
entry
Before
the
carriage
had
driven
out
of
the
village
he
first
broke
the
silence
by
exclaiming
That
's
not
the
thing
not
the
thing
no
it
wo
n't
do
What
do
you
mean
Boris
Andreyitch
asked
him
It
's
not
the
thing
not
the
thing
repeated
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
looking
away
and
turning
a
little
aside
If
you
are
saying
that
about
Sofya
Kiril
lovna
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
she
's
a
very
charming
lady
conceited
but
charming
I
should
think
so
Of
course
if
your
only
object
were
but
you
know
my
motive
in
wanting
to
make
you
acquainted
with
her
Boris
Andreyitch
did
not
answer
Well
I
tell
you
she
's
not
right
I
see
that
myself
I
like
that
saying
about
herself
'I'm
an
epicure
Why
I
've
two
teeth
out
on
the
right
side
here
but
do
you
suppose
I
talk
about
it
And
anyone
can
see
that
without
my
saying
so
And
besides
she
's
a
nice
housekeeper
isn't
she
Why
she
has
almost
starved
me
to
death
No
What
I
think
is
be
free
and
easy
be
learned
if
you
have
a
turn
that
way
have
bon
ton
if
you
like
but
be
a
good
housekeeper
before
everything
No
she
wo
n't
do
she
won't
do
that
's
not
what
you
want
There
's
no
daz
zling
you
with
those
red
waistcoats
and
night
caps
over
the
dishes
But
do
you
want
me
to
be
dazzled
asked
Boris
Andrcyitch
Oh
I
know
what
you
want
I
know
I
assure
you
I
'm
grateful
to
you
for
intro
ducing
me
to
Sofya
Kirillovna
So
much
the
better
but
I
say
again
she
wo
n't
do
The
friends
arrived
home
late
As
he
was
leaving
Boris
Andreyitch
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
I
'm
not
going
to
let
you
off
though
I
'm
not
going
to
give
you
back
your
promise
Very
well
I
'm
at
your
service
replied
Boris
Andreyitch
That
's
all
right
then
And
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
went
off
A
whole
week
passed
again
in
the
usuaJ
routine
with
the
only
difference
however
that
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
absent
for
a
whole
day
At
last
one
morning
he
appeared
again
dressed
in
his
holiday
best
and
again
proposed
to
Boris
Andreyitch
to
take
him
with
him
for
a
visit
Boris
Andreyitch
who
had
evidently
been
ex
pecting
this
invitation
with
some
impatience
obeyed
without
protest
Where
are
you
taking
me
now
he
asked
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
as
he
sat
beside
him
in
the
sledge
Winter
had
set
in
since
their
expedition
to
Sofya
Kirillovna
's
I
'm
taking
you
now
answered
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
impressively
to
a
very
respectable
family
to
the
Tihoduevs
It
's
a
most
respect
able
family
The
old
man
is
a
colonel
and
an
excellent
fellow
His
wife
is
an
excellent
lady
they
have
two
daughters
extremely
amiable
persons
very
well
educated
and
there
is
prop
erty
I
do
n't
know
which
you
will
like
best
One
well
is
rather
livelier
the
other
is
quieter
the
other
I
confess
is
too
shy
but
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
both
of
them
Well
you
will
see
Very
well
I
will
see
replied
Boris
Andrey
itch
and
thought
to
himself
Like
the
Larin
family
in
Onyegin
And
either
thanks
to
this
reminiscence
or
for
some
other
reason
his
features
assumed
an
ex
pression
of
disillusionment
and
boredom
What
's
the
father
's
name
he
asked
cas
ually
Kalimon
Ivanitch
answered
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
Kalimon
What
a
name
And
the
mother
The
mother
's
name
is
Pelageya
Ivanovna
And
the
daughters
names
One
is
Pelageya
too
and
the
other
is
Emerentsiya
I'.merentsiya
I
have
never
heard
such
a
name
in
my
life
And
Kalimon
too
Yes
the
name
certainly
is
rather
odd
Bui
what
a
girl
she
is
Simply
one
might
say
made
of
a
sort
of
virtuous
fire
Upon
my
soul
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
how
poet
ically
you
express
yourself
But
which
of
them
is
Emerentsiya
the
one
that
's
rather
quiet
No
the
other
But
there
you
'll
see
for
yourself
Emerentsiya
Kalimonovna
1
Vyazovnin
ex
claimed
once
more
Her
mother
calls
her
Emerance
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
observed
in
an
undertone
And
does
she
call
her
husband
Calimon
That
I
have
n't
heard
but
there
wait
a
bit
Oh
ril
wait
To
the
Tihoduevs
it
was
a
drive
of
nearly
twenty
miles
as
it
had
been
to
Sofya
Kiril
lovna
's
but
their
old-fashioned
house
was
not
in
the
least
like
the
jaunty
little
villa
of
the
free-and-easy
widow
It
was
a
clumsy
building
roomy
and
ram
bling
a
mass
of
dark
beams
with
dark
panes
in
the
windows
Tall
birch-trees
stood
in
two
rows
on
each
side
the
dark-brown
tops
of
huge
lime-trees
could
be
seen
behind
the
roof
the
whole
house
seemed
overgrown
in
sum
mer
all
this
vegetation
probably
brightened
up
the
place
in
winter
it
gave
it
a
still
more
dis
Z7
consolate
aspect
The
impression
made
by
the
inside
of
the
house
could
not
be
called
cheering
either
everything
in
it
looked
gloomy
and
dingy
everything
looked
older
than
it
really
was
The
friends
sent
in
their
names
and
were
ushered
into
the
drawing-room
The
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
got
up
to
greet
them
but
for
a
long
time
could
only
welcome
them
by
signs
and
bodily
movements
to
which
the
guests
on
their
side
replied
only
by
signs
and
bows
such
a
deafening
barking
was
set
up
by
four
white
sheepdogs
who
on
the
appearance
of
strangers
bounded
up
from
the
embroidered
cushions
on
which
they
had
been
lying
In
one
way
and
another
by
flap
ping
pocket-handkerchiefs
and
other
means
they
pacified
the
infuriated
curs
but
a
maid
servant
was
obliged
to
drag
one
of
them
the
oldest
and
most
spiteful
from
under
a
seat
and
to
take
it
away
into
a
bedroom
getting
bitten
on
her
right
hand
in
the
process
When
silence
was
restored
