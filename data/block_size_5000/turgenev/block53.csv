here
and
there
a
big
drop
would
suddenly
glow
crimson
Everything
was
breathing
with
freshness
with
life
and
that
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
innocent
solemnity
of
the
first
moments
of
morning
when
everything
is
already
so
bright
and
yet
still
so
silent
There
was
no
sound
but
the
trilling
notes
of
larks
over
the
distant
fields
and
in
the
copse
itself
two
or
three
birds
were
without
haste
trying
their
brief
bars
and
as
it
were
listening
to
the
effect
From
the
wet
earth
rose
a
strong
fresh
fragrance
the
pure
light
air
was
stirred
by
cool
breezes
There
was
a
feeling
of
morning
of
a
glorious
sum
mer
morning
about
everything
everything
had
the
look
and
smile
of
morning
like
the
rosy
freshly
washed
little
face
of
a
child
just
awake
Not
far
from
the
ravine
in
the
middle
of
a
glade
Veretyev
was
sitting
on
a
cloak
spread
on
the
ground
Marya
Pavlovna
was
standing
by
him
leaning
against
a
birch-tree
with
her
hands
behind
her
They
were
both
silent
Iarya
Pavlovna
was
looking
fixedly
into
the
distance
her
white
scarf
had
slipped
off
her
head
on
to
her
shoulders
the
breeze
stirred
and
lifted
the
ends
of
her
hastily
coiled
hair
Veret
yev
sat
bending
down
striking
the
ground
with
a
twig
The
two
friends
and
other
stories
Well
he
began
at
last
are
you
angry
with
me
Marya
Pavlovna
did
not
answer
Veretyev
glanced
at
her
Masha
are
you
angry
he
repeated
Marya
Pavlovna
took
a
rapid
glance
at
him
turned
slightly
away
and
said
Yes
What
for
asked
Veretyev
and
he
threw
away
the
twig
Again
Marya
Pavlovna
did
not
answer
You
have
a
right
to
be
angry
with
me
though
Veretyev
went
on
after
a
brief
silence
You
must
look
upon
me
not
merely
as
frivo
lous
but
even
You
do
n't
understand
me
Marya
Pavlovna
interrupted
I
am
not
angry
with
you
on
my
own
account
at
all
On
whose
then
On
your
own
Veretyev
raised
his
head
and
gave
a
short
laugh
Ah
I
understand
he
began
Again
you
are
beginning
to
be
worried
again
at
the
thought
of
my
not
doing
anything
with
myself
You
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
know
Masha
you
are
a
wonderful
creature
you
really
are
You
think
so
much
about
other
people
and
so
little
about
yourself
You
have
no
egoism
at
all
really
there
is
not
another
girl
like
you
in
the
world
But
the
trouble
is
that
I
do
n't
deserve
your
affection
I
tell
you
that
in
earnest
So
much
the
worse
for
you
You
feel
and
you
do
nothing
Veretyev
gave
a
short
laugh
again
Masha
pull
your
hand
from
behind
your
back
and
give
it
to
me
he
said
with
an
in
sinuating
caress
in
his
voice
Marya
Pavlovna
merely
shrugged
her
shoul
der
Give
me
your
beautiful
honest
hand
I
want
to
implant
a
tender
and
respectful
kiss
upon
it
as
the
frivolous
pupil
kisses
the
hand
of
his
indulgent
preceptor
And
Veretyev
stretched
forward
towards
Marya
Pavlovna
Oh
do
n't
she
said
you
are
always
laugh
ing
and
joking
and
will
joke
away
all
your
life
H
'm
Joke
away
my
life
A
new
expres
sion
I
suppose
Marya
Pavlovna
you
used
the
verb
'joke
away
in
a
transitive
sense
Marya
Pavlovna
frowned
Do
n't
Veretyev
she
repeated
Joke
away
my
life
repeated
Veretyev
and
he
got
up
but
you
will
make
a
worse
busi
ness
of
it
than
I
shall
you
will
waste
your
life
in
taking
things
seriously
Do
you
know
Masha
you
remind
me
of
a
scene
in
Pushkin's
'Don
Juan
You
have
not
read
Pushkin
's
'Don
Juan
No
Oh
no
I
forgot
you
do
n't
read
poetry
A
lady
called
Laura
has
visitors
come
to
see
her
she
drives
them
all
away
and
is
left
alone
with
a
man
called
Carlos
They
go
out
to
gether
on
the
balcony
it
is
a
glorious
night
Laura
admires
it
and
Carlos
suddenly
begins
to
point
out
to
her
that
she
will
grow
old
some
day
'What
of
it
Laura
answers
at
this
moment
perhaps
it
is
cold
and
raining
in
Paris
but
here
'the
night
is
fragrant
of
lemons
and
laurels
What
's
the
use
of
looking
into
the
future
Look
about
you
Masha
is
it
not
lovely
here
Look
how
everything
is
rejoicing
in
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
life
how
youthful
it
all
is
And
are
n't
we
young
ourselves
Veretyev
went
closer
to
Marya
Pavlovna
she
did
not
draw
back
but
she
did
not
turn
her
head
towards
him
Smile
Masha
he
went
on
only
your
kind
good
smile
and
not
your
usual
mocking
one
I
love
your
good
kind
smile
raise
your
proud
stern
eyes
Well
You
turn
away
Hold
out
your
hand
to
me
anyway
Ah
Veretyev
Masha
began
you
know
I
ca
n't
talk
You
tell
me
about
that
Laura
But
she
was
a
woman
It
's
pardonable
for
a
woman
not
to
think
of
the
future
When
you
speak
Masha
replied
Veretyev
you
continually
blush
from
pride
and
shyness
the
blood
comes
rushing
to
your
cheeks
in
a
flood
of
colour
I
like
that
awfully
in
you
Marya
Pavlovna
looked
straight
into
Veret
yev
's
eyes
Good-bye
she
said
and
she
pulled
her
scarf
on
to
her
head
Veretyev
held
her
back
There
there
he
cried
wait
a
little
What
is
it
you
want
Give
me
my
orders
Would
you
like
me
to
go
into
the
service
to
become
a
farmer
Would
you
like
me
to
publish
songs
with
accompaniments
on
the
guitar
to
publish
a
collection
of
poems
of
drawings
to
take
up
painting
sculpture
rope-dancing
I
'll
do
any
thing
anything
you
tell
me
if
only
you
will
be
pleased
with
me
I
will
really
Masha
be
lieve
me
Marya
Pavlovna
glanced
at
him
again
All
that
is
only
words
not
deeds
You
assure
me
you
obey
me
Of
course
I
do
obey
You
obey
me
but
how
many
times
have
I
asked
you
What
Marya
Pavlovna
hesitated
Not
to
drink
she
said
at
last
Ech
Masha
Masha
So
you
are
at
that
too
My
sister
distresses
herself
about
that
But
in
the
first
place
I
am
not
a
drunkard
and
in
the
second
do
you
know
why
I
drink
Look
at
that
swallow
there
See
how
boldly
it
disposes
of
its
little
body
it
flings
it
wherever
it
likes
See
it
has
darted
upwards
and
now
it
has
dropped
down
it
actually
squealed
with
joy
do
you
hear
So
that
's
why
I
drink
Q
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Masha
to
experience
the
same
sensations
as
that
swallow
to
fling
oneself
where
one
will
to
fly
where
the
fancy
takes
one
But
what
is
it
all
for
Masha
interrupted
How
can
you
ask
that
What
else
is
there
to
live
for
And
ca
n't
it
be
done
without
drinking
No
it
ca
n't
we
are
all
blighted
and
de
generate
Passion
now
that
produces
the
same
effect
That
is
why
I
love
you
As
you
do
wine
much
obliged
No
Masha
I
love
you
not
as
I
do
wine
Wait
a
little
I
will
prove
it
to
you
some
day
when
we
are
married
and
go
abroad
Do
you
know
I
am
dreaming
already
how
I
shall
lead
you
before
the
Venus
of
Milo
It
will
be
just
the
moment
to
repeat
If
with
grave
eyes
she
stood
before
The
Queen
of
Love
from
Melos
famed
Of
the
two
goddesses
I
trow
The
marble
beauty
would
be
shamed
Why
is
it
I
keep
talking
in
verse
to-day
It
must
be
the
influence
of
the
morning
What
air
It
's
like
wine
Wine
again
observed
Marya
Pavlovna
What
of
it
Such
a
morning
and
you
with
me
what
could
be
more
intoxicating
'With
her
grave
eyes
Yes
Veretyev
went
on
look
ing
intently
at
Marya
Pavlovna
that
is
so
But
yet
I
remember
that
I
have
seen
not
often
it
is
true
but
I
have
seen
those
splendid
dark
eyes
look
tender
And
how
lovely
they
are
then
Come
do
n't
turn
away
Masha
laugh
anyway
Show
me
your
eyes
merry
at
least
if
they
wo
n't
grant
me
a
tender
look
Leave
ofif
Veretyev
said
Marya
Pavlovna
let
me
go
it
is
time
I
was
at
home
I
'll
make
you
laugh
though
Veretyev
in
terposed
upon
my
word
I
will
Oh
look
there
runs
a
hare
Where
asked
Marya
Pavlovna
Over
there
beyond
the
ravine
through
the
field
of
oats
someone
must
have
frightened
it
they
do
n't
run
in
the
morning
Would
you
like
me
to
stop
it
And
Veretyev
gave
a
loud
whistle
The
hare
at
once
squatted
moved
its
ears
tucked
in
its
forepaws
drew
itself
up
munched
snififed
and
munched
again
Veretyev
nimbly
squatted
on
his
heels
like
the
hare
and
began
moving
his
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
nose
sniffing
and
munching
like
the
hare
The
hare
passed
its
paws
once
or
twice
over
its
face
shook
itself
its
paws
must
have
been
wet
with
the
dew
pricked
up
its
ears
and
bounded
off
Veretyev
rubbed
his
cheeks
with
his
hands
and
shook
himself
too
Mary
Pavlovna
could
not
refrain
from
laughing
Bravo
cried
Veretyev
and
he
jumped
up
bravo
You
certainly
are
not
a
coquette
Do
you
know
that
if
any
society
lady
had
teeth
like
yours
she
would
be
forever
laughing
But
that
is
what
I
love
you
for
Masha
that
you
are
not
a
society
lady
you
do
n't
laugh
without
occasion
you
do
n't
wear
gloves
and
it
is
so
nice
to
kiss
your
hands
because
they
are
sun
burnt
and
one
feels
how
strong
they
are
I
love
you
because
you
do
n't
go
in
for
being
clever
because
you
are
proud
and
silent
don't
read
books
do
n't
like
poetry
Would
you
like
me
to
repeat
some
poetry
to
you
Marya
Pavlovna
interrupted
him
with
a
peculiar
expression
in
her
face
Poetry
said
Veretyev
in
surprise
Yes
some
poetry
which
that
Petersburg
gentleman
recited
to
us
last
night
The
'Upas
Tree
again
So
you
really
were
repeating
it
at
night
in
the
garden
The
poem
suits
you
But
do
you
really
like
it
so
much
Yes
I
like
it
Repeat
it
Marya
Pavlovna
was
a
little
abashed
Repeat
it
repeat
it
Veretyev
insisted
Marya
Pavlovna
began
repeating
it
Veret
yev
stood
facing
her
folded
his
arms
and
lis
tened
At
the
first
line
Marya
Pavlovna
lifted
her
eyes
towards
the
sky
she
did
not
want
to
meet
Veretyev
's
eyes
She
repeated
the
verses
in
her
mellow
even
voice
which
recalled
the
notes
of
a
violoncello
but
when
she
reached
the
lines
And
at
his
mighty
sovereign
's
feet
Fell
the
poor
slave
and
died
her
voice
quivered
her
haughty
immobile
eye
brows
were
raised
naively
like
a
child
's
and
her
eyes
rested
on
Veretyev
with
involuntary
devotion
He
suddenly
flung
himself
at
her
feet
and
embraced
her
knees
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
I
am
your
slave
he
cried
I
am
at
your
feet
you
are
my
sovereign
my
goddess
my
ox-eyed
Hera
my
Medea
Marya
Pavlovna
vi^as
going
to
push
him
away
but
her
hands
lay
motionless
on
his
curly
hair
and
with
a
smile
of
confusion
she
bowed
her
head
CHAPTER
V
Gavril
Stepanitch
Akilin
who
was
giving
the
ball
belonged
to
that
class
of
country
gentle
men
who
arouse
the
wonder
of
their
neighbours
by
their
faculty
of
living
well
and
keeping
open
house
on
insufficient
means
Though
he
had
no
more
than
four
hundred
serfs
he
entertained
the
whole
province
in
a
huge
stone
mansion
erected
by
himself
with
columns
with
a
tower
and
a
flagstaff
upon
it
His
estate
had
come
to
him
from
his
father
and
had
never
been
noted
for
its
good
condition
Gavril
Stepan
itch
was
for
many
years
absent
from
it
serv
ing
in
Petersburg
at
last
fifteen
years
pre
viously
he
had
returned
to
his
native
place
with
the
grade
of
collegiate
assessor
with
a
wife
and
three
daughters
He
began
simul
taneously
building
and
introducing
improve
ments
immediately
set
up
an
orchestra
and
gave
dinner
parties
At
first
everyone
prophesied
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
that
he
would
inevitably
be
ruined
before
long
more
than
once
there
were
rumours
that
Gavril
Stepanitch
's
estate
was
to
be
sold
by
auction
but
the
years
passed
dinner
parties
balls
fetes
concerts
followed
one
another
as
before
new
buildings
rose
like
mushrooms
from
the
ground
and
Gavril
Stepanitch
's
estate
was
still
not
put
up
to
auction
and
he
went
on
living
as
before
and
had
even
grown
stout
of
late
Then
the
neighbours
gossip
took
another
turn
they
be
gan
hinting
at
some
considerable
sums
which
had
they
said
been
kept
secret
there
was
talk
of
buried
treasure
If
he
had
been
a
good
manager
the
gentlemen
of
the
neighbourhood
argued
one
could
understand
it
but
he
is
not
not
at
all
That
's
what
is
so
surprising
and
unaccountable
However
that
might
be
every
one
was
very
ready
to
visit
Gavril
Stepanitch
he
was
hospitable
and
would
play
cards
for
any
stake
He
was
a
little
man
with
grey
hair
and
a
conical-shaped
head
a
yellow
face
and
yellow
eyes
always
carefully
shaved
and
scented
with
eau-de-cologne
He
wore
on
ordi
nary
days
as
well
as
on
holidays
a
loose
blue
swallowtail
buttoned
up
to
the
neck
a
big
cravat
into
which
he
had
the
habit
of
sticking
his
chin
and
he
prided
himself
on
his
linen
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
thrust
out
his
lips
when
he
took
snuff
and
spoke
very
softly
and
affably
Gavril
Stepanitch
was
not
distinguished
by
his
liveliness
and
in
fact
was
not
prepossessing
in
appearance
and
did
not
look
particularly
intel
ligent
though
there
was
sometimes
a
gleam
of
cunning
in
his
eye
He
had
made
good
matches
for
his
two
elder
daughters
the
youngest
was
still
at
home
unmarried
Gavril
Stepanitch
had
also
a
wife
an
insignificant
creature
who
had
not
a
word
to
say
for
herself
At
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
Vladimir
Sergeitch
arrived
at
Ipatov
's
wearing
a
dress
coat
and
white
gloves
He
found
them
all
dressed
ready
to
set
off
the
little
girls
were
sit
ting
stiffly
afraid
of
crumpling
their
starched
white
frocks
Old
Ipatov
genially
reproached
Vladimir
Sergeitch
when
he
saw
that
the
young
man
was
wearing
a
dress-coat
and
pointed
to
his
own
frock-coat
Marya
Pavlovna
wore
a
deep
pink
muslin
dress
which
suited
her
ad
mirably
Vladimir
Sergeitch
paid
her
a
few
compliments
Marya
Pavlovna
's
beauty
at
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
tracted
him
though
she
was
evidently
shy
of
him
he
liked
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
too
but
the
freedom
of
her
manners
rather
embarrassed
him
Moreover
in
her
words
in
her
looks
and
smiles
there
was
often
a
shade
of
mockery
and
that
troubled
his
well-bred
Petersburg
soul
He
would
have
had
no
objection
to
joining
her
in
mocking
other
people
but
it
was
disagreeable
that
she
might
perhaps
be
capable
of
laughing
at
him
The
ball
had
already
begun
a
good
many
guests
had
assembled
and
the
home-trained
orchestra
was
blaring
droning
and
squeaking
in
the
gallery
when
the
Ipatov
family
with
Vladimir
Sergeitch
entered
the
ballroom
Their
host
met
them
at
the
door
thanked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
for
the
feeling
way
in
which
he
had
so
agreeably
surprised
them
as
he
expressed
himself
and
taking
Ipatov
by
the
arm
he
led
him
off
to
the
drawing-room
to
the
card-tables
Gavril
Stepanitch
had
had
an
inferior
educa
tion
and
everything
in
his
house
the
music
the
furniture
the
food
the
wines
could
not
even
be
called
second
rate
On
the
other
hand
there
was
plenty
of
everything
and
he
was
not
stuck
up
and
did
not
give
himself
airs
The
gentlemen
of
the
neighbourhood
asked
nothing
more
of
him
and
were
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
entertainment
he
gave
them
At
supper
for
instance
they
handed
caviare
cut
into
hard
blocks
and
over-salted
but
no
one
prevented
one
from
taking
it
with
one
's
fingers
and
there
was
plenty
to
wash
it
down
with
cheap
wine
it
is
true
but
real
wine
made
from
grapes
not
any
other
beverage
The
springs
in
the
furni
ture
were
so
stiff
and
unyielding
as
to
be
rather
uncomfortable
but
to
say
nothing
of
there
being
many
armchairs
and
sofas
that
had
no
springs
at
all
anyone
could
get
hold
of
a
wool
embroidered
cushion
to
put
on
his
seat
for
such
cushions
embroidered
by
Madame
Akilin's
own
hands
lay
about
in
great
profusion
every
where
and
then
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
desired
In
short
Gavril
Stepanitch
's
house
was
per
fectly
in
keeping
with
the
social
and
uncere
monious
manners
of
the
X
district
and
it
was
simply
due
to
Gavril
Stepanitch
's
own
modesty
that
the
marshal
of
the
nobility
elected
was
not
he
but
a
retired
major
called
Podpekin
a
very
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
respectable
and
worthy
man
though
he
combed
his
hair
from
his
left
ear
over
his
right
temple
dyed
his
moustache
a
purplish
tint
and
suffer
ing
from
asthma
sank
into
depression
after
dinner
And
so
the
ball
had
already
begun
A
quad
rille
of
ten
couples
was
being
danced
The
gentlemen
were
officers
of
a
regiment
stationed
in
the
neighbourhood
young
or
youngish
land
owners
and
two
or
three
officials
from
the
town
Everything
was
as
it
should
be
everything
was
going
well
The
marshal
of
the
nobility
was
playing
cards
with
a
retired
actual
civil
councillor
and
a
rich
gentleman
the
owner
of
three
thousand
serfs
The
actual
civil
council
lor
wore
on
his
first
finger
a
diamond
ring
spoke
very
slowly
and
always
kept
his
heels
together
and
his
feet
turned
out
in
the
position
affected
by
old-fashioned
dancers
he
never
turned
his
head
which
was
half
concealed
by
a
magnificent
velvet
collar
The
wealthy
gentle
man
on
the
other
hand
was
continually
laugh
ing
raising
his
eyebrows
and
flashing
the
whites
of
his
eyes
The
poet
Bodryakov
a
man
of
clumsy
and
wild
appearance
was
talking
in
a
comer
with
the
learned
historian
Yevsyukov
they
were
holding
each
other
by
their
buttons
Near
them
one
gentleman
with
an
extraordinarily
long
waist
was
expounding
some
bold
opinions
to
another
gentleman
who
gazed
timidly
at
the
top
of
his
head
Mammas
in
various
coloured
caps
were
sitting
in
a
row
along
the
walls
at
the
doors
there
were
groups
of
gentlemen
of
a
humbler
sort
young
men
looking
embarrassed
older
men
looking
unassuming
but
there
is
no
describing
it
all
All
was
as
it
should
be
I
repeat
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
had
arrived
before
the
Ipatovs
Vladimir
Sergeitch
saw
her
dancing
with
a
handsome
young
man
with
expressive
eyes
with
a
thin
black
moustache
and
shining
teeth
wearing
a
smart
dress-coat
and
a
gold
chain
hanging
in
a
semi-circle
on
his
waistcoat
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
was
dressed
in
blue
with
white
flowers
a
small
wreath
of
the
same
flowers
was
twisted
round
her
curly
hair
She
smiled
flirted
her
fan
and
looked
gaily
about
her
she
felt
herself
the
queen
of
the
ball
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
up
to
her
bowed
and
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
looking
at
her
affably
asked
her
whether
she
remembered
her
promise
of
yesterday
What
promise
You
are
dancing
the
mazurka
with
me
are
n't
you
Yes
of
course
The
young
man
who
was
standing
near
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
suddenly
turned
crimson
I
think
you
have
forgotten
Mademoiselle
he
began
that
you
had
promised
the
mazurka
to
me
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
was
confused
Oh
dear
what
am
I
to
do
she
said
'please
forgive
me
Monsieur
Steltchinsky
I
am
so
careless
I
am
really
so
ashamed
Monsieur
Steltchinsky
said
nothing
and
dropped
his
eyes
Vladimir
Sergeitch
drew
him
self
up
slightly
Be
so
kind
Monsieur
Steltchinsky
Nad
yezhda
Alexyevna
went
on
we
are
old
friends
while
Monsieur
Astahov
is
a
stranger
do
not
put
me
in
a
difficult
position
allow
me
to
dance
with
him
As
you
please
said
the
young
man
It's
for
you
to
begin
though
Thank
you
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
pro
nounced
and
fluttered
off
to
meet
her
vis-a-vis
Steltchinsky
glanced
after
her
then
looked
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Vladimir
Sergeitch
in
his
turn
looked
at
him
and
walked
away
The
quadrille
was
soon
over
Vladimir
Sergeitch
walked
up
and
down
the
ballroom
a
little
then
went
into
the
drawing-room
and
stopped
beside
one
of
the
card-tables
All
at
once
he
felt
someone
behind
him
touch
his
arm
he
turned
round
Steltchinsky
stood
before
him
I
want
a
couple
of
words
with
you
in
the
next
room
with
your
kind
permission
he
pro
nounced
in
French
with
great
politeness
and
not
with
a
Russian
accent
Vladimir
Sergeitch
followed
him
Steltchinsky
stopped
at
the
window
In
the
presence
of
a
lady
he
said
in
the
same
language
I
could
not
say
anything
but
what
I
did
but
you
do
not
I
hope
imagine
that
I
really
intend
to
surrender
to
you
my
right
to
dance
the
mazurka
with
Mile
Veretieff
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
surprised
How
do
you
mean
he
asked
A
OUIET
BACKWATER
What
I
mean
Steltchinsky
answered
calmly
his
nostrils
dilating
as
he
thrust
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat
is
that
I
do
n't
intend
to
that
's
all
Vladimir
Sergeitch
thrust
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat
too
but
his
nostrils
did
not
dilate
Allow
me
to
observe
my
dear
sir
he
began
you
may
put
Mile
Verctieff
in
an
unpleasant
position
by
your
action
and
I
imagine
That
would
be
most
painful
to
me
but
no
one
hinders
you
from
withdrawing
declaring
yourself
unwell
or
going
away
I
am
not
going
to
do
that
What
do
you
take
me
for
In
that
case
I
shall
be
forced
to
ask
you
to
give
me
satisfaction
Satisfaction
in
what
sense
In
the
obvious
sense
You
are
challenging
me
to
a
duel
Certainly
if
you
do
not
give
up
the
ma
zurka
Steltchinsky
tried
to
utter
these
words
in
the
most
unconcerned
manner
possible
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
heart
gave
a
jump
He
looked
into
the
face
of
his
unexpected
assailant
Good
Lord
he
thought
what
idiocy
THE
two
FRIENDS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
You
are
not
joking
he
said
aloud
It
is
not
my
habit
to
joke
Steltchinsky
replied
with
dignity
and
especially
with
per
sons
with
whom
I
am
not
acquainted
You
will
not
give
up
the
mazurka
he
added
after
a
brief
pause
I
will
not
give
it
up
answered
Vladimir
Sergeitch
as
though
reflecting
Very
good
We
will
fight
to-morrow
To-morrow
morning
my
second
will
call
on
you
And
with
a
polite
bow
Steltchinsky
re
tired
evidently
very
well
pleased
with
himself
Vladimir
Sergeitch
remained
a
few
moments
longer
at
the
window
Here
's
a
nice
business
he
thought
That's
what
comes
of
making
new
acquaintances
I
was
an
ass
to
come
Very
nice
Charming
He
pulled
himself
together
at
last
however
and
went
into
the
ballroom
There
they
were
already
dancing
the
polka
Marya
Pavlovna
flitted
by
him
dancing
with
Pyotr
Alexeitch
whom
he
had
not
noticed
till
then
she
looked
pale
and
even
melancholy
then
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
whirled
by
him
all
brightness
and
delight
with
a
little
bandy-legged
A
OUIEt
BACKWATER
but
ardent
artillery
officer
at
the
next
round
she
was
dancing
with
Steltchinsky
who
as
he
danced
kept
tossing
his
hair
back
Why
my
good
sir
Vladimir
Sergeitch
heard
the
voice
of
Ipatov
behind
him
why
are
you
looking
on
and
not
dancing
Confess
now
though
we
do
live
so
to
say
in
a
quiet
back
water
it
is
not
bad
here
is
it
Nice
sort
of
backwater
damn
it
thought
Valdimir
Sergeitch
and
muttering
some
sort
of
answer
to
Ipatov
he
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
ballroom
I
shall
have
to
find
a
second
he
thought
continuing
his
reflections
and
where
the
devil
am
I
to
find
him
Veretyev
is
out
of
the
question
I
do
n't
know
any
of
the
others
who
the
devil
would
have
thought
of
such
an
absurd
business
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
fond
of
mentioning
the
devil
when
he
was
vexed
At
that
moment
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
eyes
fell
on
the
Adjustable
Soul
Ivan
Ilyitch
who
was
standing
doing
nothing
by
the
window
Would
n't
he
do
he
thought
and
shrug
ging
his
shoulders
he
added
almost
aloud
I
shall
have
to
ask
him
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
up
to
him
I
have
just
had
a
very
queer
adventure
our
hero
began
with
a
forced
smile
only
imagine
a
young
man
a
complete
stranger
has
just
challenged
me
to
a
duel
it
is
utterly
im
possible
to
refuse
it
I
must
have
a
second
may
I
ask
you
Although
Ivan
Ilyitch
was
distinguished
as
the
reader
is
aware
by
imperturbable
indif
ference
even
he
was
struck
by
so
unusual
a
suggestion
He
stared
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
in
perplexity
Yes
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
I
should
be
very
much
indebted
to
you
I
know
no
one
here
You
are
the
only
one
who
I
can
not
Ivan
Ilyitch
brought
out
as
though
waking
up
from
sleep
it
is
utterly
impos
sible
Why
You
are
afraid
of
unpleasantness
but
I
hope
it
will
all
be
kept
secret
As
he
said
this
Vladimir
Sergeitch
felt
that
he
flushed
and
was
confused
A
QUIET
BACKWATEIl
How
stupid
How
awfully
stupid
it
all
is
he
was
saying
inwardly
Excuse
me
I
ca
n't
possibly
repeated
Ivan
Ilyitch
shaking
his
head
and
drawing
back
up
setting
a
chair
again
as
he
did
so
It
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
to
refuse
a
request
but
it
was
such
a
request
Anyway
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
in
an
agitated
voice
catching
hold
of
his
arm
you
will
do
me
the
favour
not
to
speak
to
anyone
of
what
I
have
told
you
I
beg
you
most
earnestly
That
I
can
do
that
I
can
do
Ivan
Ilyitch
replied
hurriedly
but
the
other
thing
I
ca
n't
say
what
you
like
I
am
not
equal
to
it
Very
well
very
well
said
Valdimir
Serge
itch
but
do
n't
forget
that
I
count
upon
your
discretion
I
shall
inform
that
gentleman
to-morrow
he
muttered
to
himself
with
vexa
tion
that
I
could
not
find
a
second
he
can
arrange
himself
as
he
likes
best
I
am
a
stranger
here
What
the
devil
possessed
me
to
apply
to
this
fellow
But
what
could
I
do
Vladimir
Sergeitch
felt
very
very
much
put
out
Meanwhile
the
ball
went
on
He
felt
very
much
inclined
to
go
away
at
once
but
till
the
mazurka
was
over
going
away
was
not
to
be
thought
of
How
could
he
let
his
opponent
triumph
Unluckily
for
Vladimir
Sergeitch
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
was
a
free-and
easy
young
man
with
long
hair
and
a
hollow
chest
over
which
a
black
satin
cravat
with
a
huge
gold
pin
in
it
flowed
like
a
small
water
fall
This
young
man
had
the
reputation
all
over
the
province
of
being
completely
versed
in
all
the
customs
and
traditions
of
the
highest
society
though
he
had
only
spent
six
months
in
Petersburg
and
had
not
succeeded
in
pene
trating
into
anything
higher
than
the
houses
of
the
collegiate
councillor
Sandaraki
and
his
son-in-law
the
civil
councillor
Kostandaraki
he
led
the
dances
at
every
ball
signalled
to
the
musicians
by
clapping
his
hands
in
the
midst
of
the
blare
of
the
trumpets
and
the
scraping
of
the
fiddles
shouted
En
avant
deux
or
Grande
chainc
or
A
vous
mademoiselle
and
pale
and
perspiring
kept
flying
about
glid
ing
and
scraping
on
the
floor
He
never
be
gan
the
mazurka
before
midnight
And
that's
A
QUlEt
BACKWATER
something
to
be
thankful
for
he
would
say
in
Petersburg
I
should
have
kept
you
waiting
for
it
till
two
o'clock
The
ball
seemed
long
tq
Vladimir
Sergeitch
He
wandered
like
a
shadow
from
the
ballroom
to
the
drawing-room
from
time
to
time
ex
changing
frigid
glances
with
his
rival
who
did
not
miss
a
single
dance
asked
Marya
Pavlovna
for
a
quadrille
but
she
was
engaged
and
once
or
twice
said
a
few
words
to
his
solicitous
host
who
seemed
troubled
by
the
look
of
boredom
on
the
face
of
his
new
acquaintance
At
last
the
strains
of
the
longed-for
mazurka
were
heard
Vladimir
Sergeitch
sought
out
his
partner
brought
two
chairs
and
sat
with
her
among
the
last
couples
almost
facing
Steltchinsky
As
was
to
be
expected
the
young
leader
of
the
dances
was
the
first
to
begin
His
counte
nance
as
he
began
the
mazurka
the
way
he
drew
his
partner
after
him
while
he
struck
the
floor
with
his
foot
and
tossed
his
head
to
de
scribe
all
this
is
almost
beyond
the
pen
of
man
I
think
you
are
bored
Monsieur
Astahov
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
began
addressing
Vladi
mir
Sergeitch
I
Not
in
the
least
What
makes
you
think
so
Why
from
your
expression
You
have
not
smiled
once
since
you
came
in
I
did
not
expect
that
of
you
It
does
n't
suit
you
prac
tical
gentlemen
to
scowl
and
be
unsociable
d
la
Byron
leave
that
to
the
poets
I
notice
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
that
you
frequently
call
me
a
practical
person
by
way
of
mocking
at
me
I
suppose
you
look
upon
me
as
a
cold
and
very
sensible
being
not
capa
ble
of
anything
But
do
you
know
what
I
can
tell
you
a
practical
person
may
often
feel
any
thing
but
light-hearted
though
he
does
not
think
it
necessary
to
display
to
others
what
is
passing
within
him
he
prefers
to
be
silent
What
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
Nad
yezhda
Alexyevna
with
a
glance
at
him
Nothing
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
with
af
fected
indifference
and
he
assumed
a
mysteri
ous
air
But
still
Nothing
really
One
day
you
will
know
later
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
would
have
pursued
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
her
questions
but
at
that
instant
a
young
lady
the
daughter
of
the
host
led
up
