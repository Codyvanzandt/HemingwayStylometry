learning
you
're
an
extraordinary
creature
Her
very
name
has
a
sweet
familiar
ring
one
is
glad
to
utter
it
it
calls
up
a
kindly
smile
at
once
How
often
for
instance
have
I
chanced
to
ask
a
peasant
'Tell
me
my
friend
how
am
I
to
get
to
Gratchevka
let
us
say
'Well
sir
you
go
on
first
to
Vyazovoe
and
from
there
to
Tatyana
Borissovna
's
and
from
Tatyana
Borissovna
's
any
one
will
show
you
the
way
And
at
the
name
of
Tatyana
Borissovna
the
peasant
wags
his
head
in
quite
a
special
way
Her
household
is
small
in
accordance
with
her
means
The
house
the
laundry
the
stores
and
the
kitchen
are
in
the
charge
of
the
housekeeper
Agafya
once
her
nurse
a
good-natured
tearful
toothless
creature
she
has
under
her
two
stalwart
girls
with
stout
crimson
cheeks
like
Antonovsky
apples
The
duties
of
valet
steward
and
waiter
are
filled
by
Policarp
an
extraordinary
old
man
of
seventy
a
queer
fellow
full
of
erudition
once
a
violinist
and
worshipper
of
Viotti
with
a
personal
hostility
to
Napoleon
or
as
he
calls
him
Bonaparty
and
a
passion
for
nightingales
He
always
keeps
five
or
six
of
the
latter
in
his
room
in
early
spring
he
will
sit
for
whole
days
together
by
the
cage
waiting
for
the
first
trill
and
when
he
hears
it
he
covers
his
face
with
his
hands
and
moans
'Oh
piteous
piteous
and
sheds
tears
in
floods
Policarp
has
to
help
him
his
grandson
Vasya
a
curly-headed
sharp-eyed
boy
of
twelve
Policarp
adores
him
and
grumbles
at
him
from
morning
till
night
He
undertakes
his
education
too
'Vasya
he
says
'say
Bonaparty
was
a
scoundrel
'And
what
'll
you
give
me
granddad
'What
'll
I
give
you
I
'll
give
you
nothing
Why
what
are
you
Are
n't
you
a
Russian
'I
'm
a
Mtchanin
granddad
I
was
born
in
Mtchensk
'Oh
silly
dunce
but
where
is
Mtchensk
'How
can
I
tell
'Mtchensk
's
in
Russia
silly
'Well
what
then
if
it
is
in
Russia
'What
then
Why
his
Highness
the
late
Prince
Mihalo
Ilarionovitch
Golenishtchev-Kutuzov-Smolensky
with
God
's
aid
graciously
drove
Bonaparty
out
of
the
Russian
territories
It
's
on
that
event
the
song
was
composed
Bonaparty
's
in
no
mood
to
dance
He
's
lost
the
garters
he
brought
from
France
Do
you
understand
he
liberated
your
fatherland
'And
what
's
that
to
do
with
me
'Ah
you
silly
boy
Why
if
his
Highness
Prince
Mihalo
Ilarionovitch
had
n't
driven
out
Bonaparty
some
mounseer
would
have
been
beating
you
about
the
head
with
a
stick
this
minute
He
'd
come
up
to
you

and
say
Koman

then
a
box
on
the

'But

'You

Well

'But

'Not

how

is
'Well

'We

Of
the
neighbouring
ladies
Tatyana
Borissovna
sees
very
little
they
do
not
care
about
going
to
see
her
and
she
does
not
know
how
to
amuse
them
the
sound
of
their
chatter
sends
her
to
sleep
she
starts
tries
to
keep
her
eyes
open
and
drops
off
again
Tatyana
Borissovna
is
not
fond
of
women
as
a
rule
One
of
her
friends
a
good
harmless
young
man
had
a
sister
an
old
maid
of
thirty-eight
and
a
half
a
good-natured
creature
but
exaggerated
affected
and
enthusiastic
Her
brother
had
often
talked
to
her
of
their
neighbour
One
fine
morning
our
old
maid
has
her
horse
saddled
and
without
a
word
to
any
one
sallies
off
to
Tatyana
Borissovna
's
In
her
long
habit
a
hat
on
her
head
a
green
veil
and
floating
curls
she
went
into
the
hall
and
passing
by
the
panic-stricken
Vasya
who
took
her
for
a
wood-witch
ran
into
the
drawing-room
Tatyana
Borissovna
scared
tried
to
rise
but
her
legs
sank
under
her
'Tatyana
Borissovna
began
the
visitor
in
a
supplicating
voice
'forgive
my
temerity
I
am
the
sister
of
your
friend
Alexy
Nikolaevitch
K
and
I
have
heard
so
much
about
you
from
him
that
I
resolved
to
make
your
acquaintance
'Greatly
honoured
muttered
the
bewildered
lady
The
sister
flung
off
her
hat
shook
her
curls
seated
herself
near
Tatyana
Borissovna
took
her
by
the
hand
'So
this
is
she
she
began
in
a
pensive
voice
fraught
with
feeling
'this
is
that
sweet
clear
noble
holy
being
This
is
she
that
woman
at
once
so
simple
and
so
deep
How
glad
I
am
how
glad
I
am
How
we
shall
love
each
other
I
can
breathe
easily
at
last
I
always
fancied
her
just
so
she
added
in
a
whisper
her
eyes
riveted
on
the
eyes
of
Tatyana
Borissovna
'You
wo
n't
be
angry
with
me
will
you
my
dear
kind
friend
'Really
I
'm
delighted
Wo
n't
you
have
some
tea
The
lady
smiled
patronisingly
Wie
wahr
wie
unreflectiert
she
murmured
as
it
were
to
herself
'Let
me
embrace
you
my
dear
one
The
old
maid
stayed
three
hours
at
Tatyana
Borissovna
's
never
ceasing
talking
an
instant
She
tried
to
explain
to
her
new
acquaintance
all
her
own
significance
Directly
after
the
unexpected
visitor
had
departed
the
poor
lady
took
a
bath
drank
some
lime-flower
water
and
took
to
her
bed
But
the
next
day
the
old
maid
came
back
stayed
four
hours
and
left
promising
to
come
to
see
Tatyana
Borissovna
every
day
Her
idea
please
to
observe
was
to
develop
to
complete
the
education
of
so
rich
a
nature
to
use
her
own
expression
and
she
would
probably
have
really
been
the
death
of
her
if
she
had
not
in
the
first
place
been
utterly
disillusioned
as
regards
her
brother
's
friend
within
a
fortnight
and
secondly
fallen
in
love
with
a
young
student
on
a
visit
in
the
neighbourhood
with
whom
she
at
once
rushed
into
a
fervid
and
active
correspondence
in
her
missives
she
consecrated
him
as
the
manner
of
such
is
to
a
noble
holy
life
offered
herself
wholly
a
sacrifice
asked
only
for
the
name
of
sister
launched
into
endless
descriptions
of
nature
made
allusions
to
Goethe
Schiller
Bettina
and
German
philosophy
and
drove
the
luckless
young
man
at
last
to
the
blackest
desperation
But
youth
asserted
itself
one
fine
morning
he
woke
up
with
such
a
furious
hatred
for
'his
sister
and
best
of
friends
that
he
almost
killed
his
valet
in
his
passion
and
was
snappish
for
a
long
while
after
at
the
slightest
allusion
to
elevated
and
disinterested
passion
But
from
that
time
forth
Tatyana
Borissovna
began
to
avoid
all
intimacy
with
ladies
of
the
neighbourhood
more
than
ever
Alas
nothing
is
lasting
on
this
earth
All
I
have
related
as
to
the
way
of
life
of
my
kind-hearted
neighbour
is
a
thing
of
the
past
the
peace
that
used
to
reign
in
her
house
has
been
destroyed
for
ever
For
more
than
a
year
now
there
has
been
living
with
her
a
nephew
an
artist
from
Petersburg
This
is
how
it
came
about
Eight
years
ago
there
was
living
with
Tatyana
Borissovna
a
boy
of
twelve
an
orphan
the
son
of
her
brother
Andryusha
Andryusha
had
large
clear
humid
eyes
a
tiny
little
mouth
a
regular
nose
and
a
fine
lofty
brow
He
spoke
in
a
low
sweet
voice
was
attentive
and
coaxing
with
visitors
kissed
his
auntie
's
hand
with
an
orphan's
sensibility
and
one
hardly
had
time
to
show
oneself
before
he
had
put
a
chair
for
one
He
had
no
mischievous
tricks
he
was
never
noisy
he
would
sit
by
himself
in
a
corner
with
a
book
and
with
such
sedateness
and
propriety
never
even
leaning
back
in
his
chair
When
a
visitor
came
in
Andryusha
would
get
up
with
a
decorous
smile
and
a
flush
when
the
visitor
went
away
he
would
sit
down
again
pull
out
of
his
pocket
a
brush
and
a
looking-glass
and
brush
his
hair
From
his
earliest
years
he
had
shown
a
taste
for
drawing
Whenever
he
got
hold
of
a
piece
of
paper
he
would
ask
Agafya
the
housekeeper
for
a
pair
of
scissors
at
once
carefully
cut
a
square
piece
out
of
the
paper
trace
a
border
round
it
and
set
to
work
he
would
draw
an
eye
with
an
immense
pupil
or
a
Grecian
nose
or
a
house
with
a
chimney
and
smoke
coming
out
of
it
in
the
shape
of
a
corkscrew
a
dog
en
face
looking
rather
like
a
bench
or
a
tree
with
two
pigeons
on
it
and
would
sign
it
'Drawn
by
Andrei
Byelovzorov
such
a
day
in
such
a
year
in
the
village
of
Maliya-Briki
He
used
to
toil
with
special
industry
for
a
fortnight
before
Tatyana
Borissovna
's
birthday
he
was
the
first
to
present
his
congratulations
and
offer
her
a
roll
of
paper
tied
up
with
a
pink
ribbon
Tatyana
Borissovna
would
kiss
her
nephew
and
undo
the
knot
the
roll
was
unfolded
and
presented
to
the
inquisitive
gaze
of
the
spectator
a
round
boldly
sketched
temple
in
sepia
with
columns
and
an
altar
in
the
centre
on
the
altar
lay
a
burning
heart
and
a
wreath
while
above
on
a
curling
scroll
was
inscribed
in
legible
characters
'To
my
aunt
and
benefactress
Tatyana
Borissovna
Bogdanov
from
her
dutiful
and
loving
nephew
as
a
token
of
his
deepest
affection
Tatyana
Borissovna
would
kiss
him
again
and
give
him
a
silver
rouble
She
did
not
though
feel
any
very
warm
affection
for
him
Andryusha
's
fawning
ways
were
not
quite
to
her
taste
Meanwhile
Andryusha
was
growing
up
Tatyana
Borissovna
began
to
be
anxious
about
his
future
An
unexpected
incident
solved
the
difficulty
to
her
One
day
eight
years
ago
she
received
a
visit
from
a
certain
Mr
Benevolensky
Piotr
Mihalitch
a
college
councillor
with
a
decoration
Mr
Benevolensky
had
at
one
time
held
an
official
post
in
the
nearest
district
town
and
had
been
assiduous
in
his
visits
to
Tatyana
Borissovna
then
he
had
moved
to
Petersburg
got
into
the
ministry
and
attained
a
rather
important
position
and
on
one
of
the
numerous
journeys
he
took
in
the
discharge
of
his
official
duties
he
remembered
his
old
friend
and
came
back
to
see
her
with
the
intention
of
taking
a
rest
for
two
days
from
his
official
labours
'in
the
bosom
of
the
peace
of
nature
Tatyana
Borissovna
greeted
him
with
her
usual
cordiality
and
Mr
Benevolensky
But
before
we
proceed
with
the
rest
of
the
story
gentle
reader
let
us
introduce
you
to
this
new
personage
Mr
Benevolensky
was
a
stoutish
man
of
middle
height
and
mild
appearance
with
little
short
legs
and
little
fat
hands
he
wore
a
roomy
and
excessively
spruce
frock-coat
a
high
broad
cravat
snow-white
linen
a
gold
chain
on
his
silk
waistcoat
a
gem-ring
on
his
forefinger
and
a
white
wig
on
his
head
he
spoke
softly
and
persuasively
trod
noiselessly
and
had
an
amiable
smile
an
amiable
look
in
his
eyes
and
an
amiable
way
of
settling
his
chin
in
his
cravat
he
was
in
fact
an
amiable
person
altogether
God
had
given
him
a
heart
too
of
the
softest
he
was
easily
moved
to
tears
and
to
transports
moreover
he
was
all
aglow
with
disinterested
passion
for
art
disinterested
it
certainly
was
for
Mr
Benevolensky
if
the
truth
must
be
told
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
art
One
is
set
wondering
indeed
whence
by
virtue
of
what
mysterious
uncomprehended
forces
this
passion
had
come
upon
him
He
was
to
all
appearance
a
practical
even
prosaic
person
however
we
have
a
good
many
people
of
the
same
sort
among
us
in
Russia
Their
devotion
to
art
and
artists
produces
in
these
people
an
inexpressible
mawkishness
it
is
distressing
to
have
to
do
with
them
and
to
talk
to
them
they
are
perfect
logs
smeared
with
honey
They
never
for
instance
call
Raphael
Raphael
or
Correggio
Correggio
'the
divine
Sanzio
the
incomparable
di
Allegri
they
murmur
and
always
with
the
broadest
vowels
Every
pretentious
conceited
home-bred
mediocrity
they
hail
as
a
genius
'the
blue
sky
of
Italy
'the
lemons
of
the
South
'the
balmy
breezes
of
the
banks
of
the
Brenta
are
for
ever
on
their
lips
'Ah
Vasya
Vasya
or
'Oh
Sasha
Sasha
they
say
to
one
another
with
deep
feeling
'we
must
away
to
the
South
we
are
Greeks
in
soul
ancient
Greeks
One
may
observe
them
at
exhibitions
before
the
works
of
some
Russian
painters
these
gentlemen
it
should
be
noted
are
for
the
most
part
passionate
patriots
First
they
step
back
a
couple
of
paces
and
throw
back
their
heads
then
they
go
up
to
the
picture
again
their
eyes
are
suffused
with
an
oily
moisture
'There
you
have
it
my
God
they
say
at
last
in
voices
broken
with
emotion
'there
's
soul
soul
Ah
what
feeling
what
feeling
Ah
what
soul
he
has
put
into
it
what
a
mass
of
soul
And
how
he
has
thought
it
out
thought
it
out
like
a
master
And
oh
the
pictures
in
their
own
drawing-rooms
Oh
the
artists
that
come
to
them
in
the
evenings
drink
tea
and
listen
to
their
conversation
And
the
views
in
perspective
they
make
them
of
their
own
rooms
with
a
broom
in
the
foreground
a
little
heap
of
dust
on
the
polished
floor
a
yellow
samovar
on
a
table
near
the
window
and
the
master
of
the
house
himself
in
skull-cap
and
dressing-gown
with
a
brilliant
streak
of
sunlight
falling
on
his
cheek
Oh
the
long-haired
nurslings
of
the
Muse
wearing
spasmodic
and
contemptuous
smiles
that
cluster
about
them
Oh
the
young
ladies
with
faces
of
greenish
pallor
who
squeal
over
their
pianos
For
that
is
the
established
rule
with
us
in
Russia
a
man
can
not
be
devoted
to
one
art
alone
he
must
have
them
all
And
so
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
these
gentlemen
extend
their
powerful
patronage
to
Russian
literature
also
especially
to
dramatic
literature
The
Jacob
Sannazars
are
written
for
them
the
struggle
of
unappreciated
talent
against
the
whole
world
depicted
a
thousand
times
over
still
moves
them
profoundly
The
day
after
Mr
Benevolensky
's
arrival
Tatyana
Borissovna
told
her
nephew
at
tea-time
to
show
their
guest
his
drawings
'Why
does
he
draw
said
Mr
Benevolensky
with
some
surprise
and
he
turned
with
interest
to
Andryusha
'Yes
he
draws
said
Tatyana
Borissovna
'he's
so
fond
of
it
and
he
does
it
all
alone
without
a
master
'Ah
show
me
show
me
cried
Mr
Benevolensky
Andryusha
blushing
and
smiling
brought
the
visitor
his
sketch-book
Mr
Benevolensky
began
turning
it
over
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
'Good
young
man
he
pronounced
at
last
'good
very
good
And
he
patted
Andryusha
on
the
head
Andryusha
intercepted
his
hand
and
kissed
it
'Fancy
now
a
talent
like
that
I
congratulate
you
Tatyana
Borissovna
'But
what
am
I
to
do
Piotr
Mihalitch
I
ca
n't
get
him
a
teacher
here
To
have
one
from
the
town
is
a
great
expense
our
neighbours
the
Artamonovs
have
a
drawing-master
and
they
say
an
excellent
one
but
his
mistress
forbids
his
giving
lessons
to
outsiders
'Hm
pronounced
Mr
Benevolensky
he
pondered
and
looked
askance
at
Andryusha
'Well
we
will
talk
it
over
he
added
suddenly
rubbing
his
hands
The
same
day
he
begged
Tatyana
Borissovna's
permission
for
an
interview
with
her
alone
They
shut
themselves
up
together
In
half-an-hour
they
called
Andryusha
Andryusha
went
in
Mr
Benevolensky
was
standing
at
the
window
with
a
slight
flush
on
his
face
and
a
beaming
expression
Tatyana
Borissovna
was
sitting
in
a
corner
wiping
her
eyes
'Come
Andryusha
she
said
at
last
'you
must
thank
Piotr
Mihalitch
he
will
take
you
under
his
protection
he
will
take
you
to
Petersburg
Andryusha
almost
fainted
on
the
spot
'Tell
me
candidly
began
Mr
Benevolensky
in
a
voice
filled
with
dignity
and
patronising
indulgence
'do
you
want
to
be
an
artist
young
man
Do
you
feel
yourself
consecrated
to
the
holy
service
of
Art
'I
want
to
be
an
artist
Piotr
Mihalitch
Andryusha
declared
in
a
trembling
voice
'I
am
delighted
if
so
it
be
It
will
of
course
continued
Mr
Benevolensky
'be
hard
for
you
to
part
from
your
revered
aunt
you
must
feel
the
liveliest
gratitude
to
her
'I
adore
my
auntie
Andryusha
interrupted
blinking
'Of
course
of
course
that
's
readily
understood
and
does
you
great
credit
but
on
the
other
hand
consider
the
pleasure
that
in
the
future
your
success
'Kiss
me
Andryusha
muttered
the
kind-hearted
lady
Andryusha
flung
himself
on
her
neck
'There
now
thank
your
benefactor
Andryusha
embraced
Mr
Benevolensky
's
stomach
and
stretching
on
tiptoe
reached
his
hand
and
imprinted
a
kiss
which
his
benefactor
though
with
some
show
of
reluctance
accepted
He
had
to
be
sure
to
pacify
the
child
and
after
all
might
reflect
that
he
deserved
it
Two
days
later
Mr
Benevolensky
departed
taking
with
him
his
new
prot
g
During
the
first
three
years
of
Andryusha
's
absence
he
wrote
pretty
often
sometimes
enclosing
drawings
in
his
letters
From
time
to
time
Mr
Benevolensky
added
a
few
words
for
the
most
part
of
approbation
then
the
letters
began
to
be
less
and
less
frequent
and
at
last
ceased
altogether
A
whole
year
passed
without
a
word
from
her
nephew
and
Tatyana
Borissovna
was
beginning
to
be
uneasy
when
suddenly
she
got
the
following
note
'DEAREST
AUNTIE
Piotr
Mihalitch
my
patron
died
three
days
ago
A
severe
paralytic
stroke
has
deprived
me
of
my
sole
support
To
be
sure
I
am
now
twenty
I
have
made
considerable
progress
during
the
last
seven
years
I
have
the
greatest
confidence
in
my
talent
and
can
make
my
living
by
means
of
it
I
do
not
despair
but
all
the
same
send
me
if
you
can
as
soon
as
convenient
250
roubles
I
kiss
your
hand
and
remain
etc
Tatyana
Borissovna
sent
her
nephew
250
roubles
Two
months
later
he
asked
for
more
she
got
together
every
penny
she
had
and
sent
it
him
Not
six
weeks
after
the
second
donation
he
was
asking
a
third
time
for
help
ostensibly
to
buy
colours
for
a
portrait
bespoken
by
Princess
Tertereshenev
Tatyana
Borissovna
refused
'Under
these
circumstances
he
wrote
to
her
'I
propose
coming
to
you
to
regain
my
health
in
the
country
And
in
the
May
of
the
same
year
Andryusha
did
in
fact
return
to
Maliya-Briki
Tatyana
Borissovna
did
not
recognise
him
for
the
first
minute
From
his
letter
she
had
expected
to
see
a
wasted
invalid
and
she
beheld
a
stout
broad-shouldered
fellow
with
a
big
red
face
and
greasy
curly
hair
The
pale
slender
little
Andryusha
had
turned
into
the
stalwart
Andrei
Ivanovitch
Byelovzorov
And
it
was
not
only
his
exterior
that
was
transformed
The
modest
spruceness
the
sedateness
and
tidiness
of
his
earlier
years
was
replaced
by
a
careless
swagger
and
slovenliness
quite
insufferable
he
rolled
from
side
to
side
as
he
walked
lolled
in
easy-chairs
put
his
elbows
on
the
table
stretched
and
yawned
and
behaved
rudely
to
his
aunt
and
the
servants
'I
'm
an
artist
he
would
say
'a
free
Cossack
That
's
our
sort
Sometimes
he
did
not
touch
a
brush
for
whole
days
together
then
the
inspiration
as
he
called
it
would
come
upon
him
then
he
would
swagger
about
as
if
he
were
drunk
clumsy
awkward
and
noisy
his
cheeks
were
flushed
with
a
coarse
colour
his
eyes
dull
he
would
launch
into
discourses
upon
his
talent
his
success
his
development
the
advance
he
was
making
It
turned
out
in
actual
fact
that
he
had
barely
talent
enough
to
produce
passable
portraits
He
was
a
perfect
ignoramus
had
read
nothing
why
should
an
artist
read
indeed
Nature
freedom
poetry
were
his
fitting
elements
he
need
do
nothing
but
shake
his
curls
talk
and
suck
away
at
his
eternal
cigarette
Russian
audacity
is
a
fine
thing
but
it
does
n't
suit
every
one
and
Polezhaevs
at
second-hand
without
the
genius
are
insufferable
beings
Andrei
Ivanovitch
went
on
living
at
his
aunt
's
he
did
not
seem
to
find
the
bread
of
charity
bitter
notwithstanding
the
proverb
Visitors
to
the
house
found
him
a
mortal
nuisance
He
would
sit
at
the
piano
a
piano
too
had
been
installed
at
Tatyana
Borissovna
's
and
begin
strumming
'The
Swift
Sledge
with
one
finger
he
would
strike
some
chords
tap
on
the
keys
and
for
hours
together
he
would
howl
Varlamov
's
songs
'The
Solitary
Pine
or
'No
doctor
no
do
n't
come
to
me
in
the
most
distressing
manner
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
disappear
altogether
his
cheeks
were
so
puffed
out
and
tense
as
drums
Then
he
would
suddenly
strike
up
'Be
still
distracting
passion
's
tempest
Tatyana
Borissovna
positively
shuddered
'It
's
a
strange
thing
she
observed
to
me
one
day
'the
songs
they
compose
nowadays
there
's
something
desperate
about
them
in
my
day
they
were
very
different
We
had
mournful
songs
too
but
it
was
always
a
pleasure
to
hear
them
For
instance
'Come
come
to
me
in
the
meadow
Where
I
am
awaiting
thee
Come
come
to
me
in
the
meadow
Where
I
'm
shedding
tears
for
thee
Alas
thou'rt
coming
to
the
meadow
But
too
late
dear
love
for
me
Tatyana
Borissovna
smiled
slyly
'I
agon-ise
I
agon-ise
yelled
her
nephew
in
the
next
room
'Be
quiet
Andryusha
'My
soul
's
consumed
apart
from
thee
the
indefatigable
singer
continued
Tatyana
Borissovna
shook
her
head
'Ah
these
artists
these
artists
A
year
has
gone
by
since
then
Byelovzorov
is
still
living
at
his
aunt
's
and
still
talking
of
going
back
to
Petersburg
He
has
grown
as
broad
as
he
is
long
in
the
country
His
aunt
who
could
have
imagined
such
a
thing
idolises
him
and
the
young
girls
of
the
neighbourhood
are
falling
in
love
with
him
Many
of
her
old
friends
have
given
up
going
to
Tatyana
Borissovna
's
I
have
a
neighbour
a
young
landowner
and
a
young
sportsman
One
fine
July
morning
I
rode
over
to
him
with
a
proposition
that
we
should
go
out
grouse-shooting
together
He
agreed
'Only
let
's
go
he
said
'to
my
underwoods
at
Zusha
I
can
seize
the
opportunity
to
have
a
look
at
Tchapligino
you
know
my
oakwood
they
're
felling
timber
there
'By
all
means
He
ordered
his
horse
to
be
saddled
put
on
a
green
coat
with
bronze
buttons
stamped
with
a
boar
's
head
a
game-bag
embroidered
in
crewels
and
a
silver
flask
slung
a
new-fangled
French
gun
over
his
shoulder
turned
himself
about
with
some
satisfaction
before
the
looking-glass
and
called
his
dog
Hope
a
gift
from
his
cousin
an
old
maid
with
an
excellent
heart
but
no
hair
on
her
head
We
started
My
neighbour
took
with
him
the
village
constable
Arhip
a
stout
squat
peasant
with
a
square
face
and
jaws
of
antediluvian
proportions
and
an
overseer
he
had
recently
hired
from
the
Baltic
provinces
a
youth
of
nineteen
thin
flaxen-haired
and
short-sighted
with
sloping
shoulders
and
a
long
neck
Herr
Gottlieb
von
der
Kock
My
neighbour
had
himself
only
recently
come
into
the
property
It
had
come
to
him
by
inheritance
from
an
aunt
the
widow
of
a
councillor
of
state
Madame
Kardon-Kataev
an
excessively
stout
woman
who
did
nothing
but
lie
in
her
bed
sighing
and
groaning
We
reached
the
underwoods
'You
wait
for
me
here
at
the
clearing
said
Ardalion
Mihalitch
my
neighbour
addressing
his
companions
The
German
bowed
got
off
his
horse
pulled
a
book
out
of
his
pocket
a
novel
of
Johanna
Schopenhauer
's
I
fancy
and
sat
down
under
a
bush
Arhip
remained
in
the
sun
without
stirring
a
muscle
for
an
hour
We
beat
about
among
the
bushes
but
did
not
come
on
a
single
covey
Ardalion
Mihalitch
announced
his
intention
of
going
on
to
the
wood
I
myself
had
no
faith
somehow
in
our
luck
that
day
I
too
sauntered
after
him
We
got
back
to
the
clearing
The
German
noted
the
page
got
up
put
the
book
in
his
pocket
and
with
some
difficulty
mounted
his
bob-tailed
broken-winded
mare
who
neighed
and
kicked
at
the
slightest
touch
Arhip
shook
himself
gave
a
tug
at
both
reins
at
once
swung
his
legs
and
at
last
succeeded
in
starting
his
torpid
and
dejected
nag
We
set
off
I
had
been
familiar
with
Ardalion
Mihalitch
's
wood
from
my
childhood
I
had
often
strolled
in
Tchapligino
with
my
French
tutor
Monsieur
D
sir
Fleury
the
kindest
of
men
who
had
however
almost
ruined
my
constitution
for
life
by
dosing
me
with
Leroux
's
mixture
every
evening
The
whole
wood
consisted
of
some
two
or
three
hundred
immense
oaks
and
ash-trees
Their
stately
powerful
trunks
were
magnificently
black
against
the
transparent
golden
green
of
the
nut
bushes
and
mountain-ashes
higher
up
their
wide
knotted
branches
stood
out
in
graceful
lines
against
the
clear
blue
sky
unfolding
into
a
tent
overhead
hawks
honey-buzzards
and
kestrels
flew
whizzing
under
the
motionless
tree-tops
variegated
wood-peckers
tapped
loudly
on
the
stout
bark
the
blackbird
's
bell-like
trill
was
heard
suddenly
in
the
thick
foliage
following
on
the
ever-changing
note
of
the
gold-hammer
in
the
bushes
below
was
the
chirp
and
twitter
of
hedge-warblers
siskins
and
peewits
finches
ran
swiftly
along
the
paths
a
hare
would
steal
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
halting
cautiously
as
he
ran
a
squirrel
would
hop
sporting
from
tree
to
tree
then
suddenly
sit
still
with
its
tail
over
its
head
In
the
grass
among
the
high
ant-hills
under
the
delicate
shade
of
the
lovely
feathery
deep-indented
bracken
were
violets
and
lilies
of
the
valley
and
funguses
russet
yellow
brown
red
and
crimson
in
the
patches
of
grass
among
the
spreading
bushes
red
strawberries
were
to
be
found
And
oh
the
shade
in
the
wood
In
the
most
stifling
heat
at
mid-day
it
was
like
night
in
the
wood
such
peace
such
fragrance
such
freshness
I
had
spent
happy
times
in
Tchapligino
and
so
I
must
own
it
was
with
melancholy
feelings
I
entered
the
wood
I
knew
so
well
The
ruinous
snowless
winter
of
1840
had
not
spared
my
old
friends
the
oaks
and
the
ashes
withered
naked
covered
here
and
there
with
sickly
foliage
they
struggled
mournfully
up
above
the
young
growth
which
'took
their
place
but
could
never
replace
them
Footnote
In
1840
there
were
severe
frosts
and
no
snow
fell
up
to
the
very
end
of
December
all
the
wintercorn
was
frozen
and
many
splendid
oak-forests
were
destroyed
by
that
merciless
winter
It
will
be
hard
to
replace
them
the
productive
force
of
the
land
is
apparently
diminishing
in
the
'interdicted
wastelands
visited
by
processions
with
holy
images
and
so
not
to
be
touched
instead
of
the
noble
trees
of
former
days
birches
and
aspens
grow
of
themselves
and
indeed
they
have
no
idea
among
us
of
planting
woods
at
all
Author
's
Note
Some
trees
still
covered
with
leaves
below
fling
their
lifeless
ruined
branches
upwards
as
it
were
in
reproach
and
despair
in
others
stout
dead
dry
branches
are
thrust
out
of
the
midst
of
foliage
still
thick
though
with
none
of
the
luxuriant
abundance
of
old
others
have
fallen
altogether
and
lie
rotting
like
corpses
on
the
ground
And
who
could
have
dreamed
of
this
in
former
days
there
was
no
shade
no
shade
to
be
found
anywhere
in
Tchapligino
'Ah
I
thought
looking
at
the
dying
trees
'is
n't
it
shameful
and
bitter
for
you
Koltsov
's
lines
recurred
to
me
'What
has
become
Of
the
mighty
voices
The
haughty
strength
The
royal
pomp
Where
now
is
the
Wealth
of
green
'How
is
it
Ardalion
Mihalitch
I
began
'that
they
did
n't
fell
these
trees
the
very
next
year
You
see
they
wo
n't
give
for
them
now
a
tenth
of
what
they
would
have
done
before
He
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
'You
should
have
asked
my
aunt
that
the
timber
merchants
came
offered
money
down
pressed
the
matter
in
fact
'_Mein
Gott
mein
Gott
Von
der
Kock
cried
at
every
step
'Vat
a
bity
vat
a
bity
'What
's
a
bity
observed
my
neighbour
with
a
smile
'That
is
how
bitiful
I
meant
to
say
What
particularly
aroused
his
regrets
were
the
oaks
lying
on
the
ground
and
indeed
many
a
miller
would
have
given
a
good
sum
for
them
But
the
constable
Arhip
preserved
an
unruffled
composure
and
did
not
indulge
in
any
lamentations
on
the
contrary
he
seemed
even
to
jump
over
them
and
crack
his
whip
on
them
with
a
certain
satisfaction
We
were
getting
near
the
place
where
they
were
cutting
down
the
trees
when
suddenly
a
shout
and
hurried
talk
was
heard
following
on
the
crash
of
a
falling
tree
and
a
few
instants
after
a
young
peasant
pale
and
dishevelled
dashed
out
of
the
thicket
towards
us
'What
is
it
where
are
you
running
Ardalion
Mihalitch
asked
him
He
stopped
at
once
'Ah
Ardalion
Mihalitch
sir
an
accident
'What
is
it
'Maksim
sir
crushed
by
a
tree
'How
did
it
happen
Maksim
the
foreman
'The
foreman
sir
We
'd
started
cutting
an
ash-tree
and
he
was
standing
looking
on
He
stood
there
a
bit
and
then
off
he
went
to
the
well
for
some
water
wanted
a
drink
seemingly
when
suddenly
the
ash-tree
began
creaking
