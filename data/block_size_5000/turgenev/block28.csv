more
while
over
the
son
's
face
and
closed
eyes
there
passed
a
curious
expression
A
pause
followed
Then
Bazarov
said
To
comfort
you
I
will
not
altogether
refuse
your
request
but
since
you
yourself
have
said
that
I
am
better
surely
there
can
be
no
need
for
hurry
Yes
you
are
better
Evgenii
you
are
better
but
who
can
say
what
may
lie
in
the
dispensation
of
God
Whereas
once
this
duty
shall
have
been
fulfilled
Yet
I
will
wait
a
little
interrupted
Bazarov
This
much
however
I
will
concede
that
should
you
prove
to
be
wrong
in
your
surmise
as
to
my
recovery
I
will
allow
the
Last
Sacrament
to
be
administered
And
Evgenii
I
beg
of
you
to
I
will
wait
a
little
I
repeat
And
now
let
me
go
to
sleep
Do
not
disturb
me
And
he
replaced
his
head
in
its
former
position
while
the
old
man
rose
from
his
knees
reseated
himself
in
the
chair
rested
his
chin
upon
his
hands
and
fell
to
biting
his
fingers
Presently
Vasili
's
ear
caught
the
rumble
of
a
light
carriage
the
sound
which
is
always
so
distinguishable
in
a
quiet
country
spot
Nearer
and
nearer
came
the
sound
of
the
wheels
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
hard
breathing
of
horses
Springing
from
his
chair
he
rushed
to
the
window
Into
the
courtyard
of
the
mansion
there
was
turning
a
two-seated
four-horsed
buggy
Without
stopping
to
think
what
this
could
mean
he
darted
forward
to
the
front
door
where
transported
with
joy
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
a
liveried
footman
open
the
door
of
the
vehicle
and
assist
thence
a
lady
in
a
black
cloak
with
a
veil
of
the
same
hue
I
am
Madame
Odintsov
she
said
Is
Evgenii
Vasilitch
still
alive
I
presume
you
are
his
father
I
have
brought
with
me
a
doctor
Even
as
she
spoke
the
doctor
in
question
a
German-looking
little
individual
in
spectacles
descended
in
a
slow
and
dignified
manner
from
the
buggy
O
angel
of
mercy
cried
Vasili
Ivanitch
as
seizing
her
hand
he
pressed
it
convulsively
to
his
lips
Yes
our
Evgenii
is
still
alive
And
now
he
will
be
saved
Wife
Wife
There
is
an
angel
come
to
us
from
Heaven
What
responded
the
old
woman
with
a
gasp
as
she
came
running
out
of
the
hall
So
lost
in
bewilderment
was
she
that
falling
at
Anna
Sergievna
's
feet
she
actually
began
madly
to
kiss
the
hem
of
the
visitor
's
cloak
Come
come
Madame
exclaimed
What
does
all
this
mean
But
Arina
Vlasievna
was
deaf
to
everything
and
Vasili
Ivanitch
too
could
only
continue
repeating
There
is
an
angel
come
to
us
from
Heaven
There
is
an
angel
come
to
us
from
Heaven
There
is
an
angel
come
to
us
from
Heaven
Wo
ist
der
Kranke
Where
is
the
patient
asked
the
doctor
with
a
touch
of
impatience
This
restored
Vasili
Ivanitch
to
his
senses
Come
this
way
come
this
way
he
said
Yes
pray
follow
me
Werthester
Herr
Kollega
titles
based
upon
the
strength
of
bygone
memories
For
answer
the
German
exclaimed
Eh
and
pulled
a
not
very
gracious
smirk
Vasili
Ivanitch
led
the
way
to
the
study
Here
is
the
doctor
brought
by
Madame
Anna
Sergievna
Odintsov
he
said
as
he
bent
over
his
son
She
herself
too
is
here
Bazarov
opened
his
eyes
with
a
start
What
do
you
say
he
asked
I
say
that
Madame
Anna
Sergievna
Odintsov
is
here
and
that
she
has
brought
with
her
this
good
doctor
Bazarov
peered
around
Where
is
Anna
Sergievna
he
murmured
Do
you
say
that
she
is
here
Then
I
wish
to
see
her
You
shall
see
her
Evgenii
but
first
of
all
I
must
have
a
chat
with
this
gentleman
and
tell
him
the
story
of
your
illness
for
Sidor
Sidorovitch
that
was
the
name
of
the
district
physician
has
gone
home
and
a
short
consultation
must
be
held
Bazarov
eyed
the
German
All
right
he
said
Hold
your
consultation
as
soon
as
you
like
Only
do
not
speak
in
Latin
for
I
know
the
meaning
of
the
words
Jam
moritur
Der
Herr
scheint
des
Deutschen
mächtig
zu
sein
the
newly-arrived
disciple
of
Æsculapius
remarked
to
Vasili
Ivanitch
Ich
habe
the
old
man
began
then
added
But
perhaps
we
had
better
speak
in
Russian
my
dear
sir
And
the
consultation
followed
Half
an
hour
later
Vasili
Ivanitch
conducted
Anna
Sergievna
into
the
study
As
the
doctor
passed
out
he
whispered
to
her
that
recovery
was
hopeless
She
glanced
at
Bazarov
and
halted
as
though
petrified
so
striking
was
the
bloodshot
deathlike
face
with
the
dim
eyes
turned
so
yearningly
in
her
direction
Nevertheless
her
feeling
was
one
merely
of
chill
oppressive
terror
while
at
the
same
moment
there
flashed
through
her
brain
the
thought
that
if
she
had
loved
him
no
such
feeling
could
now
have
been
present
I
thank
you
he
said
with
an
effort
I
had
not
expected
this
and
you
have
done
a
kind
act
in
coming
So
we
meet
once
more
even
as
you
foretold
Has
not
Madame
Anna
Sergievna
indeed
been
kind
put
in
Vasili
Ivanitch
Father
pray
leave
us
said
Bazarov
I
know
Anna
Sergievna
that
you
will
excuse
him
For
at
such
a
time
as
this
And
he
nodded
towards
his
weak
prostrate
form
Vasili
Ivanitch
left
the
room
A
second
time
I
thank
you
continued
Bazarov
To
have
acted
so
is
worthy
of
the
Tsars
For
they
say
that
even
the
Sovereign
visits
a
deathbed
when
requested
Evgenii
Vasilitch
I
hope
that
Let
us
speak
plainly
My
course
is
run
I
am
under
the
wheel
and
we
need
not
think
of
the
future
Yet
how
curious
it
is
that
to
each
individual
human
being
death
old
though
it
is
as
an
institution
comes
as
a
novelty
Nevertheless
it
shall
not
make
me
quail
and
then
there
will
fall
the
curtain
and
then
well
then
they
will
write
Fuit
There
followed
a
feeble
gesture
But
what
did
I
want
to
say
to
you
That
I
have
loved
you
There
was
a
time
when
the
phrase
'I
love
had
for
me
no
meaning
and
now
it
will
have
less
than
ever
seeing
that
love
is
a
form
and
that
my
particular
embodiment
of
it
is
fast
lapsing
towards
dissolution
It
Ah
how
perfect
you
are
You
stand
there
as
beautiful
as
There
passed
over
Anna
Sergievna
an
involuntary
shudder
Nay
he
said
You
need
not
be
afraid
But
will
you
not
sit
down
Seat
yourself
near
me
but
not
too
near
for
my
malady
is
infectious
She
crossed
the
room
with
a
rapid
step
and
seated
herself
beside
the
sofa
on
which
he
was
lying
O
woman
of
kind
heart
he
whispered
And
to
think
that
you
are
beside
me
once
more
To
think
that
you
so
pure
and
fresh
and
young
are
in
this
sorry
room
Well
good-bye
and
may
you
live
long
and
enjoy
your
time
while
you
may
Of
all
things
in
this
world
long
life
is
the
most
desirable
yet
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
an
ugly
spectacle
I
a
half-crushed
but
still
wriggling
worm
am
now
become
There
was
a
time
when
I
used
to
say
'I
will
do
many
things
in
life
and
refuse
to
die
before
I
have
completed
those
tasks
for
I
am
a
giant
but
now
I
have
indeed
a
giant
's
task
in
hand
the
task
of
dying
as
though
death
were
nothing
to
me
No
matter
I
am
not
going
to
put
my
tail
between
my
legs
He
broke
off
and
groped
for
his
tumbler
She
handed
it
him
without
drawing
off
her
glove
Her
breath
was
coming
in
jerks
It
will
not
be
long
before
you
will
have
forgotten
me
he
went
on
For
a
dead
mortal
is
no
companion
for
a
living
one
I
daresay
that
my
father
will
tell
you
what
a
man
is
being
lost
to
Russia
but
that
is
all
rubbish
Nevertheless
do
not
undeceive
him
for
he
is
old
old
Rather
comfort
him
as
you
would
comfort
a
child
and
also
be
kind
to
my
mother
Two
such
mortals
as
them
you
will
not
find
in
all
your
great
world
no
not
though
you
search
for
them
with
a
candle
by
daylight
Russia
needs
me
indeed
Evidently
she
does
not
need
me
Whom
then
does
she
need
She
needs
shoemakers
tailors
butchers
What
does
a
butcher
sell
He
sells
meat
does
he
not
I
think
that
I
am
wandering
I
seem
to
see
before
me
a
forest
He
pressed
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
Anna
Sergievna
bent
over
him
Evgenii
Vasilitch
she
said
I
am
here
With
a
combined
movement
he
took
her
hand
and
raised
himself
a
little
Good-bye
he
said
with
a
sudden
spasm
of
energy
and
a
last
flash
of
his
eyes
Good-bye
I
kissed
you
that
time
did
I
not
when
when
Ah
breathe
now
upon
the
expiring
lamp
that
it
may
go
out
in
peace
She
pressed
her
lips
gently
to
his
forehead
Enough
he
murmured
as
he
sank
back
upon
the
pillow
Now
let
there
come
darkness
She
left
the
room
quietly
Well
whispered
Vasili
Ivanitch
He
has
gone
to
sleep
she
replied
in
a
voice
that
was
scarcely
audible
But
Bazarov
was
not
fated
to
go
to
sleep
Rather
as
night
approached
he
sank
into
a
state
of
coma
and
on
the
following
day
expired
Father
Alexis
performed
over
him
the
last
rites
of
religion
and
at
the
moment
when
Extreme
Unction
was
being
administered
and
the
holy
oil
touched
his
breast
one
of
the
dying
man
's
eyelids
raised
itself
and
over
the
face
there
seemed
to
flit
something
like
an
expression
of
distaste
at
the
sight
of
the
priest
in
his
vestments
the
smoking
censer
and
the
candles
before
the
ikon
Finally
when
Bazarov
's
last
breath
had
been
drawn
and
there
had
arisen
in
the
house
the
sound
of
the
general
lamentation
something
akin
to
frenzy
came
upon
Vasili
Ivanitch
I
declare
that
I
protest
he
cried
with
his
face
blazing
and
quivering
with
fury
and
his
fist
beating
the
air
as
in
menace
of
some
one
I
declare
that
I
protest
that
I
protest
that
I
protest
Upon
that
old
Arina
Vlasievna
suffused
in
tears
laid
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
the
two
sank
forward
upon
the
floor
Said
Anfisushka
later
when
relating
the
story
in
the
servants
quarters
There
they
knelt
together
side
by
side
their
heads
drooping
like
those
of
two
sheep
at
midday
Ah
but
in
time
the
heat
of
noontide
passes
and
to
it
there
succeed
nightfall
and
dusk
with
a
return
to
the
quiet
fold
where
for
the
weary
and
the
heavy-laden
there
waits
sleep
sweet
sleep
1
Roast
beef
with
horse-radish
Since
that
time
six
months
have
passed
and
there
has
fallen
upon
the
country
a
white
winter
a
winter
of
clear
keen
motionless
frosts
of
deep
crackling
snow
of
pink-rimed
trees
of
pale-emerald
heavens
of
smoke-capped
chimneys
of
puffs
of
vapour
from
momentarily
opened
doors
of
faces
fresh
and
hard-bitten
of
horses
galloping
headlong
to
thaw
their
frozen
limbs
It
is
now
the
close
of
a
January
day
and
the
increasing
chill
of
evening
is
nipping
the
still
air
in
an
ever-tightening
vice
as
the
sun
sinks
downward
into
a
sea
of
red
But
in
the
windows
of
Marino
there
are
lights
burning
and
Prokofitch
vested
in
a
black
tail-coat
a
pair
of
white
gloves
and
a
peculiar
atmosphere
of
solemnity
is
laying
the
table
with
seven
covers
This
is
because
a
week
ago
there
were
solemnised
in
the
tiny
church
of
the
parish
solemnised
quietly
almost
without
a
witness
two
sets
of
nuptials
the
nuptials
of
Arkady
and
Katia
and
those
of
Nikolai
Petrovitch
and
Thenichka
And
to-day
Nikolai
Petrovitch
is
offering
his
brother
a
farewell
dinner
for
the
reason
that
Paul
is
on
the
point
of
departing
for
Moscow
whither
Anna
Sergievna
has
already
removed
after
bestowing
upon
the
younger
of
the
two
couples
a
handsome
dowry
At
three
o'clock
precisely
the
company
gathers
around
the
board
Mitia
too
is
present
with
his
niania
in
nurse
's
cap
while
Paul
Petrovitch
is
seated
between
Katia
and
Thenichka
and
the
bridegrooms
are
ranged
one
on
either
side
of
their
newly-wedded
spouses
A
change
has
taken
place
in
our
old
acquaintances
since
last
we
saw
them
they
have
improved
as
regards
the
younger
ones
both
in
appearance
and
in
sedateness
of
demeanour
Only
Paul
Petrovitch
looks
thinner
though
the
circumstance
imparts
if
anything
an
added
touch
of
refinement
and
grand-seignorishness
to
his
always
expressive
features
Thenichka
in
particular
is
a
different
person
from
what
she
was
Clad
in
a
brand-new
silken
gown
and
wearing
a
broad
velvet
band
over
her
hair
and
a
necklace
around
her
throat
she
holds
herself
with
an
immovable
dignity
yet
also
with
an
immovable
deference
towards
her
surroundings
And
meanwhile
she
smiles
as
much
as
to
say
Pardon
me
but
I
am
not
responsible
for
this
while
the
others
respond
with
similar
smiles
as
though
they
too
would
be
glad
to
excuse
themselves
for
their
share
in
the
proceedings
Yet
the
fact
that
on
every
one
present
sits
a
touch
of
gravity
and
embarrassment
becomes
the
company
no
less
than
do
their
other
characteristics
Everywhere
too
there
is
to
be
seen
such
an
anxious
solicitude
for
mutual
wants
that
the
company
could
seem
unanimously
to
be
playing
some
simple-minded
comedy
and
though
of
the
guests
the
quietest
is
Katia
it
is
plain
from
her
confidence
of
bearing
that
as
a
daughter-in-law
she
has
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
Nikaiai
Petrovitch
At
length
the
meal
comes
to
an
end
and
Nikolai
rising
and
grasping
a
wine-glass
addresses
Paul
Petrovitch
Dearest
brother
you
are
about
to
leave
us
Yes
you
are
about
to
leave
us
But
not
for
long
must
you
be
absent
since
I
for
one
could
never
express
to
you
how
much
I
how
much
I
that
is
to
say
how
much
we
But
to
tell
you
the
truth
I
am
not
good
at
making
a
speech
Arkady
to
you
I
depute
the
task
But
I
am
not
ready
Papa
Neither
am
I
However
Paul
I
embrace
you
and
wish
you
every
joy
and
beg
of
you
to
return
to
us
soon
Whereupon
Paul
Petrovitch
exchanges
greetings
all
round
not
excluding
little
Mitia
and
in
particular
kisses
Thenichka
's
hand
which
she
has
not
learnt
to
offer
in
the
right
way
drinks
a
twice-filled
glass
to
the
company
at
large
and
says
with
a
profound
sigh
May
you
all
be
happy
my
friends
Farewell
1
And
though
the
English
terminal
flourish
passes
unnoticed
every
one
is
touched
with
the
benediction
which
has
preceded
it
Yes
and
I
drink
to
the
memory
of
Bazarov
whispers
Katia
to
her
husband
as
she
clinks
glasses
with
him
but
though
in
response
he
squeezes
her
hand
he
decides
not
to
propose
the
toast
in
public
And
here
apparently
there
ought
to
follow
the
word
Finis
but
since
some
of
my
readers
may
care
to
know
how
each
of
the
characters
in
the
book
is
faring
at
the
present
day
I
will
satisfy
that
curiosity
To
take
Anna
Sergievna
first
she
has
married
not
for
love
nor
yet
out
of
a
sense
of
duty
a
rising
young
statesman
who
is
an
intelligent
legislator
a
severely
practical
thinker
a
man
of
strong
will
and
eloquence
and
a
lover
with
a
temperament
as
cold
as
ice
Nevertheless
the
pair
reside
on
amicable
terms
and
may
in
time
attain
to
happiness
nay
even
to
love
As
for
the
Princess
she
is
dead
and
her
memory
perished
with
her
The

and
the
estate
now
brings
in
a
fair
income
Nikolai
Petrovitch
too
is
constant
in
his
endeavours
to
make
peace
on
the
property
and
riding
systematically
round
it
delivers
long
speeches
in
the
belief
that
only
need
the
peasantry
be
reasoned
with
that
is
to
say
plied
with
the
same
words
over
and
over
again
for
the
muzhik
gradually
to
become
a
tractable
animal
Yet
Nikolai
earns
the
approval
neither
of
the
educated
gentry
who
speak
with
affected
jauntiness
of
the
coming
'mancipation
2
they
invariably
give
the
syllable
an
a
nasal
inflection
nor
of
those
uneducated
landowners
who
roundly
curse
what
they
term
that
'_mun_cipation
In
other
words
for
both
classes
Nikolai
Petrovitch
is
too
mild
Katerina
Sergievna
has
had
a
son
born
to
her
and
named
him
Kolia
Mitia
is
now
a
big
active
volubly
lisping
boy
and
Thenichka
rather
Theodosia
Nikolaievna
adores
her
daughter-in-law
only
less
than
her
husband
and
Mitia
In
fact
that
adoration
reaches
the
point
that
should
Katia
sit
down
to
the
piano
Thenichka
can
not
leave
her
though
the
playing
continue
all
day
Then
a
word
concerning
Peter
the
valet
As
much
a
lump
of
mingled
stupidity
and
conceit
as
ever
he
still
pronounces
his
e
's
as
u
's
but
has
taken
unto
himself
a
wife
and
with
her
a
respectable
dowry
The
daughter
of
a
market
gardener
of
the
neighbouring
town
she
had
already
refused
two
eligible
partis
solely
on
the
ground
that
they
did
not
possess
watches
But
Peter
possesses
not
only
a
watch
but
also
a
pair
of
patent
leather
pumps
Again
any
day
on
the
Brühl
Terrace
in
Dresden
you
may
meet
between
two
and
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
the
fashionable
hour
for
a
promenade
a
man
of
about
fifty
Grey-headed
and
afflicted
with
gout
yet
still
handsome
he
is
elegantly
dressed
and
stamped
with
that
air
of
good
breeding
which
comes
only
of
long
association
with
elevated
strata
of
society
That
man
is
Paul
Petrovitch
Having
left
Moscow
for
foreign
parts
for
his
health
's
sake
he
has
settled
in
Dresden
for
the
reason
that
there
he
possesses
the
largest
number
of
English
and
nomad-Russian
acquaintances
Towards
the
former
he
bears
himself
with
simplicity
and
almost
with
modesty
but
with
a
touch
of
hauteur
and
in
return
the
English
look
upon
him
as
a
trifle
tedious
but
respect
him
on
the
score
of
his
being
quite
a
gentleman
In
the
presence
of
the
Russian
element
however
Paul
Petrovitch
is
more
free
and
easy
he
gives
rein
unstintedly
to
his
sarcasm
and
rallies
both
his
compatriots
and
himself
Yet
from
him
such
things
come
pleasantly
and
with
a
gay
insouciance
and
in
a
becoming
manner
while
in
addition
he
holds
Slavophil
views
views
which
as
we
all
know
invariably
induce
the
great
world
to
rate
their
holder
a
person
très
distingué
True
never
by
any
chance
does
Paul
read
a
Russian
book
yet
by
way
of
compensation
there
stands
on
his
writing-table
a
silver
ash-tray
shaped
like
a
muzhik's
clog
Moreover
from
some
of
our
Russian
tourists
he
receives
considerable
attention
when
they
happen
to
be
passing
through
the
town
and
even
our
old
friend
Matvei
Ilyitch
Koliazin
on
finding
himself
in
temporary
opposition
has
paid
him
a
visit
while
en
route
to
Bohemia
for
a
course
of
the
waters
In
fact
the
only
persons
who
show
Paul
no
deference
at
all
are
the
native
Germans
whose
society
he
does
not
greatly
cultivate
Yet
even
they
agree
that
in
the
matter
of
obtaining
tickets
for
the
Court
Chapel
or
the
theatre
and
so
forth
none
is
so
clever
so
dexterous
as
der
Herr
Baron
von
Kirsanov
In
fact
always
does
he
do
the
right
thing
so
far
as
he
is
able
and
even
yet
he
can
create
some
stir
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
has
once
and
to
good
purpose
been
a
social
lion
Yet
life
presses
upon
him
not
a
little
heavily
more
heavily
than
he
himself
is
aware
Merely
need
one
look
at
him
as
huddled
against
the
aisle
wall
of
the
Russian
church
he
sits
plunged
in
thought
with
his
lips
bitterly
compressed
and
continues
sitting
there
until
remembering
his
surroundings
he
makes
almost
imperceptibly
the
sign
of
the
cross
In
similar
fashion
Madame
Kukshin
has
gone
abroad
in
her
case
to
Heidelberg
where
she
is
engaged
in
studying
not
natural
science
but
architecture
a
branch
wherein
she
has
according
to
herself
discovered
several
new
laws
Also
still
she
is
hail-fellow-well-met
with
students
more
especially
with
some
of
those
Russian
physicists
and
chemists
who
swarm
in
Heidelberg
and
who
though
at
first
flabbergasting
the
simple-minded
German
professors
with
the
moderation
of
their
views
subsequently
proceed
to
flabbergast
those
professors
with
the
wholeheartedness
of
their
sloth
In
fact
it
is
of
two
or
three
of
those
chemistry
students
who
though
unable
to
distinguish
even
oxygen
from
azote
are
yet
charged
to
the
brim
with
conceit
and
the
spirit
of
denial
that
Madame
Kukshin
's
circle
is
chiefly
composed
Similarly
friend
Sitnikov
is
preparing
to
become
a
great
man
For
which
purpose
he
is
flaunting
it
in
St
Petersburg
and
to
quote
his
own
expression
carrying
on
the
work
of
the
late
Bazarov
True
rumour
declares
that
some
one
has
recently
given
him
a
second
thrashing
as
also
that
he
Sitnikov
has
declined
to
face
the
music
rather
that
he
has
preferred
to
hint
in
an
obscure
article
in
an
equally
obscure
newspaper
that
his
assailant
is
the
coward
but
to
this
report
Sitnikov
merely
attaches
the
epithet
ironical
For
the
rest
his
father
continues
to
send
him
remittances
while
his
wife
accounts
him
equally
a
littérateur
and
a
fool
Lastly
in
a
remote
corner
of
Russia
there
lies
a
little
country
cemetery
Like
most
cemeteries
of
the
kind
it
is
depressing
of
aspect
Over
its
fences
dense
masses
of
weed
have
grown
its
drab
wooden
crosses
are
rickety
and
turning
mouldy
under
their
blistered
painted
canopies
its
stone
paths
have
lost
their
alignment
and
look
as
though
some
one
has
displaced
them
from
below
its
two
or
three
ragged
trees
diffuse
only
the
scantiest
of
shade
and
sheep
wander
unhindered
over
its
tombs
But
among
those
tombs
there
lies
a
grave
which
no
man
molests
and
no
animal
tramples
upon
only
the
birds
perch
upon
it
and
sing
as
evening
falls
For
around
that
grave
stands
an
iron
railing
and
at
its
head
and
foot
are
planted
two
young
fir
trees
It
is
the
grave
of
Evgenii
Vasilitch
Bazarov
Occasionally
from
the
neighbouring
manor-house
there
come
two
aged
and
decrepit
folk
a
man
and
his
wife
Supporting
one
another
with
a
step
which
ever
grows
heavier
they
approach
the
railing
sink
upon
their
knees
and
weep
long
bitter
tears
as
they
gaze
at
the
dumb
headstone
where
their
son
lies
sleeping
Then
they
exchange
a
word
or
two
dust
the
stone
with
assiduous
care
lay
upon
it
a
sprig
of
fir
and
offer
a
last
petition
Yet
even
then
they
can
scarce
bear
to
tear
themselves
from
the
spot
where
they
can
draw
nearest
to
their
son
and
to
their
memories
of
him
But
are
those
tears
those
prayers
all
fruitless
Is
that
love
that
hallowed
selfless
love
of
theirs
to
be
wholly
unavailing
No
no
and
a
thousand
times
no
For
though
the
heart
which
lies
within
that
tomb
may
have
been
passionate
and
wild
and
erring
the
flowers
which
bloom
in
that
spot
contemplate
us
with
eyes
of
naught
but
peace
and
innocence
and
speak
to
us
of
naught
but
the
eternal
mighty
calm
of
unheeding
nature
as
an
image
of
the
Eternal
Reconciliation
and
of
the
Life
which
shall
have
no
End

TATYANA
BORISSOVNA
AND
HER
NEPHEW
Give
me
your
hand
gentle
reader
and
come
along
with
me
It
is
glorious
weather
there
is
a
tender
blue
in
the
May
sky
the
smooth
young
leaves
of
the
willows
glisten
as
though
they
had
been
polished
the
wide
even
road
is
all
covered
with
that
delicate
grass
with
the
little
reddish
stalk
that
the
sheep
are
so
fond
of
nibbling
to
right
and
to
left
over
the
long
sloping
hillsides
the
green
rye
is
softly
waving
the
shadows
of
small
clouds
glide
in
thin
long
streaks
over
it
In
the
distance
is
the
dark
mass
of
forests
the
glitter
of
ponds
yellow
patches
of
village
larks
in
hundreds
are
soaring
singing
falling
headlong
with
outstretched
necks
hopping
about
the
clods
the
crows
on
the
highroad
stand
still
look
at
you
peck
at
the
earth
let
you
drive
close
up
and
with
two
hops
lazily
move
aside
On
a
hill
beyond
a
ravine
a
peasant
is
ploughing
a
piebald
colt
with
a
cropped
tail
and
ruffled
mane
is
running
on
unsteady
legs
after
its
mother
its
shrill
whinnying
reaches
us
We
drive
on
into
the
birch
wood
and
drink
in
the
strong
sweet
fresh
fragrance
Here
we
are
at
the
boundaries
The
coachman
gets
down
the
horses
snort
the
trace-horses
look
round
the
centre
horse
in
the
shafts
switches
his
tail
and
turns
his
head
up
towards
the
wooden
yoke
above
it
the
great
gate
opens
creaking
the
coachman
seats
himself
Drive
on
the
village
is
before
us
Passing
five
homesteads
and
turning
off
to
the
right
we
drop
down
into
a
hollow
and
drive
along
a
dyke
the
farther
side
of
a
small
pond
behind
the
round
tops
of
the
lilacs
and
apple-trees
a
wooden
roof
once
red
with
two
chimneys
comes
into
sight
the
coachman
keeps
along
the
hedge
to
the
left
and
to
the
spasmodic
and
drowsy
baying
of
three
pug
dogs
he
drives
through
the
wide
open
gates
whisks
smartly
round
the
broad
courtyard
past
the
stable
and
the
barn
gallantly
salutes
the
old
housekeeper
who
is
stepping
sideways
over
the
high
lintel
in
the
open
doorway
of
the
storehouse
and
pulls
up
at
last
before
the
steps
of
a
dark
house
with
light
windows
We
are
at
Tatyana
Borissovna
's
And
here
she
is
herself
opening
the
window
and
nodding
at
us
'Good
day
ma'am
Tatyana
Borissovna
is
a
woman
of
fifty
with
large
prominent
grey
eyes
a
rather
broad
nose
rosy
cheeks
and
a
double
chin
Her
face
is
brimming
over
with
friendliness
and
kindness
She
was
once
married
but
was
soon
left
a
widow
Tatyana
Borissovna
is
a
very
remarkable
woman
She
lives
on
her
little
property
never
leaving
it
mixes
very
little
with
her
neighbours
sees
and
likes
none
but
young
people
She
was
the
daughter
of
very
poor
landowners
and
received
no
education
in
other
words
she
does
not
know
French
she
has
never
been
in
Moscow
and
in
spite
of
all
these
defects
she
is
so
good
and
simple
in
her
manners
so
broad
in
her
sympathies
and
ideas
so
little
infected
with
the
ordinary
prejudices
of
country
ladies
of
small
means
that
one
positively
can
not
help
marvelling
at
her
Indeed
a
woman
who
lives
all
the
year
round
in
the
country
and
does
not
talk
scandal
nor
whine
nor
curtsey
is
never
flurried
nor
depressed
nor
in
a
flutter
of
curiosity
is
a
real
marvel
She
usually
wears
a
grey
taffetas
gown
and
a
white
cap
with
lilac
streamers
she
is
fond
of
good
cheer
but
not
to
excess
all
the
preserving
pickling
and
salting
she
leaves
to
her
housekeeper
'What
does
she
do
all
day
long
you
will
ask
'Does
she
read
No
she
does
n't
read
and
to
tell
the
truth
books
are
not
written
for
her
If
there
are
no
visitors
with
her
Tatyana
Borissovna
sits
by
herself
at
the
window
knitting
a
stocking
in
winter
in
summer
time
she
is
in
the
garden
planting
and
watering
her
flowers
playing
for
hours
together
with
her
cats
or
feeding
her
doves
She
does
not
take
much
part
in
the
management
of
her
estate
But
if
a
visitor
pays
her
a
call
some
young
neighbour
whom
she
likes
Tatyana
Borissovna
is
all
life
directly
she
makes
him
sit
down
pours
him
out
some
tea
listens
to
his
chat
laughs
sometimes
pats
his
cheek
but
says
little
herself
in
trouble
or
sorrow
she
comforts
and
gives
good
advice
How
many
people
have
confided
their
family
secrets
and
the
griefs
of
their
hearts
to
her
and
have
wept
over
her
hands
At
times
she
sits
opposite
her
visitor
leaning
lightly
on
her
elbow
and
looks
with
such
sympathy
into
his
face
smiles
so
affectionately
that
he
can
not
help
feeling
'What
a
dear
good
woman
you
are
Tatyana
Borissovna
Let
me
tell
you
what
is
in
my
heart
One
feels
happy
and
warm
in
her
small
snug
rooms
in
her
house
it
is
always
so
to
speak
fine
weather
Tatyana
Borissovna
is
a
wonderful
woman
but
no
one
wonders
at
her
her
sound
good
sense
her
breadth
and
firmness
her
warm
sympathy
in
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
others
in
a
word
all
her
qualities
are
so
innate
in
her
they
are
no
trouble
no
effort
to
her
One
can
not
fancy
her
otherwise
and
so
one
feels
no
need
to
thank
her
She
is
particularly
fond
of
watching
the
pranks
and
follies
of
young
people
she
folds
her
hands
over
her
bosom
throws
back
her
head
puckers
up
her
eyes
and
sits
smiling
at
them
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
heaves
a
sigh
and
says
'Ah
my
children
my
children
Sometimes
one
longs
to
go
up
to
her
take
hold
of
her
hands
and
say
'Let
me
tell
you
Tatyana
Borissovna
you
do
n't
know
your
own
value
for
all
your
simplicity
and
lack
of
