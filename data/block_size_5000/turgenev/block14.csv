heart
of
gold
Nevertheless
did
you
notice
his
nervousness
to-night
Arkady
nodded
as
though
to
himself
such
a
weakness
was
a
perfect
stranger
Curious
indeed
commented
Bazarov
Ah
you
elderly
Romanticists
You
over-develop
the
nervous
system
until
the
balance
is
upset
Now
good-night
In
my
room
there
is
an
English
washstand
yet
the
door
will
not
shut
But
such
things
English
washstands
I
mean
need
to
be
encouraged
they
represent
'progress
And
Bazarov
departed
while
Arkady
surrendered
himself
to
a
sensation
of
comfort
How
pleasant
was
it
to
be
sinking
to
sleep
in
one's
comfortable
home
and
in
one
's
own
familiar
bed
and
under
a
well-known
coverlet
worked
by
loving
hands
perhaps
those
of
his
good
kind
tireless
old
nurse
And
at
the
thought
of
Egorovna
he
sighed
and
commended
her
soul
to
the
Heavenly
Powers
But
for
himself
he
did
not
pray
Soon
both
he
and
Bazarov
were
asleep
but
certain
other
members
of
the
household
there
were
who
remained
wakeful
In
particular
had
Nikolai
Petrovitch
been
greatly
excited
by
his
son
's
return
and
though
he
went
to
bed
he
left
the
candle
burning
and
resting
with
his
head
on
his
hands
lay
thinking
deeply
Also
his
brother
sat
up
in
his
study
until
nearly
midnight
Seated
in
an
ample
armchair
before
a
corner
where
a
marble
stove
was
smouldering
he
had
effected
no
alteration
in
his
costume
beyond
having
exchanged
his
patent
leather
boots
for
a
pair
of
heelless
red
felt
slippers
Lastly
he
was
holding
though
not
reading
the
latest
number
of
Galignani
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
stove
where
a
quivering
blue
spurt
of
flame
kept
alternately
disappearing
and
bursting
forth
again
Whither
his
thoughts
were
wandering
God
only
knows
but
that
they
were
not
meandering
through
the
past
alone
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
in
his
expression
there
was
a
concentrated
gloom
which
is
never
in
evidence
when
a
man
's
mind
is
occupied
with
memories
and
no
more
Finally
seated
on
a
chest
in
a
small
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
wearing
a
blue
dressing-jacket
and
thrown
over
her
dark
hair
a
white
scarf
was
the
girl
Thenichka
As
she
sat
there
she
kept
listening
and
starting
and
gazing
towards
an
open
door
which
at
once
afforded
a
glimpse
of
an
infant
's
cot
and
admitted
the
sound
of
a
sleeping
child
's
respiration

I
think
that
our
friend
Arkady
has
acquired
some
polish

Dear
Papa
3
Father
Next
morning
Bazarov
was
the
first
to
awake
and
go
out
of
doors
Ah
thought
he
to
himself
as
he
gazed
about
him
this
is
not
much
of
a
place
to
look
at
When
apportioning
allotments
to
his
peasantry
Nikolai
Petrovitch
had
found
himself
forced
to
exclude
from
the
new
farm
four
desiatins
of
level
naked
land
and
upon
this
space
had
built
himself
a
house
quarters
for
his
servants
and
a
homestead
Also
he
had
laid
out
a
garden
dug
a
pond
and
sunk
two
wells
But
the
young
trees
had
fared
badly
very
little
water
had
risen
in
the
pond
and
the
wells
had
developed
a
brackish
taste
The
only
vegetation
to
attain
robust
growth
was
a
clump
of
lilacs
and
acacias
under
the
shade
of
which
the
household
was
accustomed
to
take
tea
or
to
dine
Within
a
few
minutes
Bazarov
had
traversed
all
the
paths
in
the
garden
visited
the
stables
and
the
cattlesheds
and
made
friends
with
two
young
household
serfs
whom
he
happened
to
encounter
and
with
whom
he
set
forth
to
catch
frogs
in
a
marsh
about
a
verst
from
the
manor
For
what
do
you
want
frogs
barin
asked
one
of
the
lads
To
make
them
useful
replied
Bazarov
who
possessed
a
peculiar
gift
for
winning
the
confidence
of
his
inferiors
even
though
he
never
cozened
them
but
on
the
contrary
always
treated
them
with
asperity
You
see
I
like
to
open
them
and
then
to
observe
what
their
insides
are
doing
You
and
I
are
frogs
too
except
that
we
walk
upon
our
hind
legs
Thus
the
operation
helps
me
to
understand
what
is
taking
place
in
ourselves
And
what
good
will
that
do
you
This
That
if
you
should
fall
sick
and
I
should
have
to
treat
you
I
might
avoid
some
mistakes
Then
you
are
a
doctor
I
am
Listen
to
that
Vasika
The
barin
says
that
you
and
I
too
are
frogs
My
word
I
do
n't
like
frogs
remarked
Vasika
a
barefooted
boy
of
seven
with
a
head
as
white
as
tow
and
a
costume
made
up
of
a
grey
blouse
and
a
stiff
collar
Why
do
n't
you
like
them
asked
Bazarov
Do
you
think
they
will
bite
you
Nay
Into
the
water
my
young
philosophers
Nikolai
Petrovitch
too
had
left
his
bed
and
on
going
to
visit
Arkady
found
him
fully
dressed
wherefore
father
and
son
proceeded
to
repair
to
the
terrace
and
there
seated
themselves
under
the
shade
of
the
awning
Amid
nosegays
of
lilac
a
tea-urn
was
simmering
on
a
table
by
the
balustrade
and
presently
there
appeared
upon
the
scene
also
the
damsel
who
on
the
previous
night
had
met
the
arrivals
on
the
verandah
She
announced
in
shrill
tones
Theodosia
Nikolaevna
is
not
very
well
this
morning
and
can
not
come
to
breakfast
So
she
has
told
me
to
ask
you
whether
you
will
pour
out
tea
for
yourselves
or
whether
she
is
to
send
Duniasha
I
will
pour
it
out
myself
Nikolai
Petrovitch
replied
with
some
haste
Will
you
have
cream
or
lemon
in
your
tea
Arkady
Cream
he
replied
After
a
pause
he
continued
Papasha
Nikolai
Petrovitch
glanced
confusedly
in
his
direction
Yes
said
he
Arkady
lowered
his
eyes
Pardon
me
if
my
question
should
seem
to
you
indiscreet
he
began
but
owing
to
your
frankness
of
last
night
I
am
emboldened
to
return
it
You
will
not
take
offence
will
you
Oh
no
Pray
go
on
Then
I
feel
encouraged
to
ask
you
whether
it
whether
it
is
because
I
am
here
that
she
that
is
to
say
Thenichka
has
not
joined
us
at
breakfast
Nikolai
Petrovitch
slightly
averted
his
face
It
may
be
so
he
said
at
length
At
all
events
I
presume
that
that
she
prefers
she
prefers
in
fact
that
she
is
shy
Arkady
glanced
at
his
father
But
why
should
she
be
shy
he
inquired
In
the
first
place
you
know
my
views
he
uttered
the
words
with
no
little
complacency
and
in
the
second
place
surely
you
can
not
suppose
that
I
would
by
a
hair's
breadth
intrude
upon
your
life
and
your
habits
No
sure
am
I
that
never
could
you
make
a
bad
choice
and
if
you
have
asked
this
girl
to
reside
under
your
roof
that
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
she
has
well
deserved
it
In
any
case
moreover
it
is
not
for
a
son
to
summon
his
father
to
judgment
least
of
all
for
me
who
possess
a
father
like
yourself
a
father
who
has
never
restricted
his
son
's
freedom
of
action
At
first
Arkady
's
voice
had
trembled
a
little
since
not
only
did
he
feel
that
he
was
doing
the
magnanimous
but
also
he
knew
that
he
was
delivering
something
like
a
lecture
to
his
father
but
such
an
effect
does
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
exercise
upon
a
human
being
that
towards
the
end
Arkady
pronounced
his
words
firmly
and
even
with
a
certain
degree
of
empressement
I
thank
you
Arkady
Nikolai
Petrovitch
said
faintly
as
his
fingers
began
their
customary
perambulation
of
his
forehead
Nor
is
your
conjecture
mistaken
for
if
this
girl
had
not
deserved
the
invitation
I
should
not
of
course
have
in
other
words
as
you
imply
this
is
no
frivolous
whim
on
my
part
Nor
need
I
have
spoken
of
the
matter
were
it
not
that
I
desired
you
to
understand
that
she
might
possibly
have
felt
embarrassed
at
meeting
you
on
the
very
day
after
your
arrival
Then
let
me
go
and
meet
her
exclaimed
Arkady
with
another
access
of
magnanimity
as
he
sprang
from
his
chair
Yes
let
me
go
and
explain
to
her
why
she
need
not
shun
me
Nikolai
Petrovitch
also
rose
Arkady
he
began
pray
do
me
a
favour
Hitherto
I
had
not
warned
you
that
But
without
listening
to
him
Arkady
darted
from
the
terrace
For
a
moment
or
two
Nikolai
Petrovitch
gazed
after
him
then
overcome
with
confusion
relapsed
into
a
chair
His
heart
was
beating
rapidly
Whether
or
not
he
was
picturing
to
himself
a
strangeness
of
future
relations
with
his
son
whether
he
was
imagining
that
had
his
son
refrained
from
interfering
the
latter
might
have
paid
him
more
respect
in
future
whether
he
was
reproaching
himself
for
his
own
weakness
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
his
thoughts
were
Probably
in
them
there
was
a
combination
of
the
feelings
just
indicated
if
only
in
the
form
of
apprehensions
Yet
those
apprehensions
can
not
have
been
deeply
rooted
as
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
for
all
the
beating
of
his
heart
the
colour
had
not
left
his
face
Soon
hasty
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
and
Arkady
reappeared
on
the
terrace
I
have
made
her
acquaintance
he
shouted
with
a
kindly
good-humoured
triumphant
expression
That
Theodosia
Nikolaievna
is
not
well
to-day
is
a
fact
but
also
it
is
a
fact
that
she
is
going
to
appear
later
And
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
I
had
a
little
brother
Otherwise
I
should
have
gone
and
kissed
him
last
night
even
as
I
have
done
this
moment
Nikolai
Petrovitch
tried
to
say
something
to
rise
and
to
make
an
explanation
of
some
sort
but
Arkady
cut
him
short
by
falling
upon
his
neck
What
is
this
Again
embracing
said
Paul
Petrovitch
behind
them
As
a
matter
of
fact
neither
father
nor
son
was
ill-pleased
to
see
him
appear
for
however
touching
such
situations
may
be
one
may
be
equally
glad
to
escape
from
them
At
what
are
you
surprised
asked
Nikolai
Petrovitch
gaily
Remember
that
I
have
not
seen
Arkesha
for
several
centuries
at
all
events
not
since
last
night
Oh
I
am
not
surprised
said
Paul
Petrovitch
On
the
contrary
I
should
not
mind
embracing
him
myself
And
Arkady
on
approaching
his
uncle
felt
once
more
upon
his
cheek
the
impression
of
a
perfumed
moustache
Paul
Petrovitch
then
sat
down
to
table
Clad
in
an
elegant
morning
suit
of
English
cut
he
was
flaunting
on
his
head
a
diminutive
fez
which
helped
the
carelessly
folded
tie
to
symbolise
the
freedom
of
a
country
life
At
the
same
time
the
stiff
collar
of
the
shirt
which
was
striped
not
white
as
best
befitted
a
matutinal
toilet
supported
with
its
usual
rigour
an
immaculately
shaven
chin
Well
Arkady
said
he
Where
is
your
new
friend
Out
somewhere
He
seldom
misses
going
for
an
early
morning
walk
But
the
great
thing
is
to
take
no
notice
of
him
for
he
detests
all
ceremony
So
I
have
perceived
And
with
his
usual
deliberateness
Paul
Petrovitch
began
to
butter
a
piece
of
bread
Will
he
be
staying
here
very
long
Well
as
long
as
he
may
care
to
stay
As
a
matter
of
fact
he
is
going
on
to
his
father
's
place
And
where
does
his
father
live
Some
eighty
versts
from
here
in
the
same
province
as
ourselves
I
believe
he
has
a
small
property
and
used
to
be
an
army
doctor
H
'm
Ever
since
last
night
I
have
been
asking
myself
where
I
can
have
heard
the
name
before
Nikolai
do
you
remember
whether
there
was
a
doctor
of
that
name
in
our
father
's
division
Yes
there
used
to
be
Then
that
doctor
will
be
this
fellow
's
father
H
'm
And
Paul
Petrovitch
twitched
his
moustache
What
exactly
is
your
Bazarov
he
enquired
of
Arkady
What
is
he
Arkady
repeated
smiling
Do
you
really
want
me
to
tell
you
what
he
is
Uncle
If
you
please
my
nephew
He
is
a
Nihilist
A
what
exclaimed
Nikolai
Petrovitch
while
even
Paul
Petrovitch
paused
in
the
act
of
raising
a
knife
to
the
edge
of
which
there
was
a
morsel
of
butter
adhering
A
Nihilist
repeated
Arkady
A
Nihilist
queried
Nikolai
Petrovitch
I
imagine
that
that
must
be
a
term
derived
from
the
Latin
nihil
or
'nothing
It
denotes
I
presume
a
man
who
a
man
who
well
a
man
who
declines
to
accept
anything
Or
a
man
who
declines
to
respect
anything
hazarded
Paul
Petrovitch
as
he
re-applied
himself
to
the
butter
No
a
man
who
treats
things
solely
from
the
critical
point
of
view
corrected
Arkady
But
the
two
things
are
one
and
the
same
are
they
not
queried
Paul
Petrovitch
Oh
no
A
Nihilist
is
a
man
who
declines
to
bow
to
authority
or
to
accept
any
principle
on
trust
however
sanctified
it
may
be
And
to
what
can
that
lead
asked
Paul
Petrovitch
It
depends
upon
the
individual
In
one
man
's
case
it
may
lead
to
good
in
that
of
another
to
evil
I
see
But
we
elders
view
things
differently
We
folk
of
the
older
generation
believe
that
without
principles
Paul
Petrovitch
pronounced
the
word
softly
and
with
a
French
accent
whereas
Arkady
had
pronounced
it
with
an
emphasis
on
the
leading
syllable
without
principles
it
is
impossible
to
take
a
single
step
in
life
or
to
draw
a
single
breath
Mais
vous
avez
changé
tout
cela
God
send
you
health
and
a
general
's
rank
Messieurs
Nihil
how
do
you
pronounce
it
Ni-hi-lists
said
Arkady
distinctly
Quite
so
formerly
we
had
Hegelists
and
now
they
have
become
Nihilists
God
send
you
health
and
a
general
's
rank
but
also
let
us
see
how
you
will
contrive
to
exist
in
an
absolute
void
an
airless
vacuum
Pray
ring
the
bell
brother
Nikolai
for
it
is
time
for
me
to
take
my
cocoa
Nikolai
Petrovitch
did
as
requested
and
also
shouted
for
Duniasha
but
instead
of
the
latter
there
issued
on
to
the
terrace
Thenichka
in
person
A
young
woman
of
twenty-three
she
was
pale
and
gentle-looking
with
dark
eyes
and
hair
a
pair
of
childishly
red
pouting
lips
and
delicate
hands
Also
she
was
clad
in
a
clean
cotton
gown
a
new
blue
kerchief
was
thrown
lightly
over
her
rounded
shoulders
and
she
was
carrying
in
front
of
her
a
large
cup
of
cocoa
Shyly
she
placed
the
latter
before
Paul
Petrovitch
while
a
warm
rosy
current
of
blood
suffused
the
exquisite
skin
of
her
comely
face
and
then
she
remained
standing
by
the
table
with
lowered
eyes
and
the
tips
of
her
fingers
touching
its
surface
Yet
though
she
looked
as
though
she
were
regretting
having
come
she
looked
as
though
she
felt
that
she
had
a
right
to
be
there
Paul
Petrovitch
frowned
and
Nikolai
Petrovitch
looked
confused
Good
morning
Thenichka
the
latter
muttered
Good
morning
she
replied
in
a
low
clear
voice
Then
she
glanced
askance
at
Arkady
and
he
smiled
at
her
in
friendly
fashion
Finally
she
departed
with
a
quiet
step
and
slightly
careless
gait
the
latter
a
peculiarity
of
hers
Silence
reigned
on
the
terrace
For
a
while
Paul
Petrovitch
drank
his
cocoa
Then
he
suddenly
raised
his
head
and
muttered
Monsieur
Nihilist
is
about
to
give
us
the
pleasure
of
his
company
True
enough
Bazarov
could
be
seen
stepping
across
the
flowerbeds
On
his
linen
jacket
and
trousers
was
a
thick
coating
of
mud
to
the
crown
of
his
ancient
circular
hat
clung
a
piece
of
sticky
marshweed
and
in
his
hand
he
was
holding
a
small
bag
Also
something
in
the
bag
kept
stirring
as
though
it
were
alive
Approaching
the
terrace
with
rapid
strides
he
nodded
to
the
company
and
said
Good
morning
gentlemen
Pardon
me
for
being
so
late
I
shall
be
back
presently
but
first
my
captures
must
be
stowed
away
What
are
those
captures
Paul
Petrovitch
inquired
Leeches
No
frogs
Do
you
eat
them
Or
do
you
breed
them
I
catch
them
for
purposes
of
experiment
was
Bazarov
's
only
reply
as
carelessly
he
entered
the
house
In
other
words
he
vivisects
them
was
Paul
Petrovitch
's
comment
In
other
words
he
believes
in
frogs
more
than
in
principles
Arkady
threw
his
uncle
a
reproachful
look
and
even
Nikolai
Petrovitch
shrugged
his
shoulders
so
that
Paul
Petrovitch
himself
felt
his
bon
mot
to
have
been
out
of
place
and
hastened
to
divert
the
subject
to
the
estate
and
the
new
steward
Bazarov
returning
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
fell
to
drinking
tea
The
brothers
contemplated
him
in
silence
Arkady
glanced
covertly
from
his
father
to
his
uncle
and
back
again
Have
you
walked
far
this
morning
at
length
Nikolai
Petrovitch
inquired
To
a
marsh
beside
an
aspen
coppice
By
the
way
Arkady
I
flushed
five
head
of
woodcock
Perhaps
you
would
like
to
go
and
shoot
them
Then
you
yourself
are
no
sportsman
No
That
is
to
say
you
prefer
physics
to
anything
else
This
from
Paul
Petrovitch
Yes
I
prefer
physics
in
fact
the
natural
sciences
in
general
to
anything
else
Well
I
am
told
that
the
Germanics
have
made
great
strides
in
that
department
Paul
Petrovitch
used
the
term
Germanics
instead
of
Germans
ironically
but
no
one
noticed
it
True
was
Bazarov
's
careless
reply
In
fact
the
Germans
are
in
the
same
respect
our
masters
You
think
highly
of
the
Germans
Paul
Petrovitch
's
tone
was
now
studiously
polite
for
he
was
beginning
to
feel
irritated
with
the
man
his
aristocratic
nature
could
not
altogether
stomach
Bazarov's
absolute
lack
of
ceremony
the
fact
that
this
doctor
's
son
not
only
knew
no
diffidence
but
actually
returned
snappish
and
reluctant
answers
and
infused
a
brusquerie
akin
to
rudeness
into
his
tone
At
least
the
savants
of
that
part
of
the
world
have
some
energy
in
them
retorted
Bazarov
Quite
so
And
your
opinion
of
our
Russian
savants
is
well
perhaps
less
flattering
It
is
with
your
leave
That
constitutes
a
piece
of
laudable
modesty
on
your
part
Paul
Petrovitch
observed
with
a
slight
hitch
of
his
figure
and
a
toss
of
his
head
But
how
comes
it
about
that
Arkady
has
just
told
us
that
you
recognise
no
authorities
whatsoever
Do
you
not
trust
authorities
Why
should
I
Is
anything
in
the
world
trustworthy
Certainly
should
I
be
told
a
fact
I
agree
with
it
but
that
is
all
Oh
Then
the
Germans
confine
themselves
solely
to
facts
Paul
Petrovitch
's
face
had
now
assumed
an
expression
of
detachment
as
though
he
had
suddenly
become
withdrawn
to
the
ultimate
heights
of
the
empyrean
No
not
all
Germans
replied
Bazarov
with
a
passing
yawn
Clearly
he
had
no
mind
to
continue
the
controversy
Meanwhile
Paul
Petrovitch
glanced
at
Arkady
as
much
as
to
say
Admit
that
your
friend
has
beautiful
manners
For
my
own
part
he
continued
ostentatiously
and
with
an
effort
I
a
fallible
mortal
do
not
favour
the
Germans
Of
course
I
am
not
including
in
that
category
the
Russo_-Germans
who
as
we
know
are
birds
of
passage
Rather
it
is
the
Germans
of
Germany
proper
whom
I
can
not
abide
Once
upon
a
time
they
used
to
produce
men
like
Schiller
and
like
what
's
his
name
Goethe
for
both
of
which
authors
my
brother
has
a
marked
predilection
But
now
the
German
nation
has
become
a
nation
solely
of
chemists
and
materialists
A
good
chemist
is
worth
a
score
of
your
poets
remarked
Bazarov
Quite
so
Paul
Petrovitch
hitched
his
eyebrows
a
little
as
though
he
had
come
near
to
falling
asleep
Er
I
take
it
then
that
you
decline
to
recognise
art
but
believe
only
in
science
I
have
told
you
that
I
believe
in
nothing
at
all
What
after
all
is
science
that
is
to
say
science
in
the
mass
A
science
may
exist
even
as
a
trade
or
a
profession
may
exist
but
with
regard
to
science
in
the
mass
there
is
no
such
thing
Very
good
And
with
regard
to
such
other
postulates
as
usually
are
granted
in
human
affairs
the
attitude
which
you
adopt
is
negative
in
the
same
degree
What
is
this
suddenly
countered
Bazarov
Is
it
an
examination
in
tenets
Paul
Petrovitch
turned
pale
and
Nikolai
Petrovitch
thought
it
time
to
intervene
in
the
dispute
Nay
we
will
debate
the
subject
later
he
said
And
then
while
recognising
your
views
good
Evgenii
Vasilitch
we
will
state
our
own
Individually
speaking
I
am
delighted
that
you
should
be
interested
in
the
natural
sciences
For
instance
I
am
told
that
recently
Liebig
1
has
made
some
surprising
discoveries
in
the
matter
of
the
improvement
of
soils
Consequently
you
might
be
able
to
help
me
in
my
agricultural
labours
and
to
give
me
much
useful
advice
Always
I
shall
be
at
your
service
Nikolai
Petrovitch
replied
Bazarov
But
what
has
Liebig
to
do
with
us
First
the
alphabet
should
be
learnt
before
we
try
to
read
books
We
have
not
even
reached
the
letter
A
You
are
a
Nihilist
that
is
plain
enough
reflected
Nikolai
Petrovitch
while
aloud
he
added
Yet
allow
me
to
seek
your
occasional
assistance
Brother
Paul
I
believe
it
is
time
that
we
interviewed
our
steward
Paul
Petrovitch
rose
from
his
chair
Yes
he
said
without
looking
at
any
one
in
particular
it
is
indeed
a
terrible
thing
to
have
lived
five
years
in
the
country
and
to
have
stood
remote
from
superior
intellects
If
one
is
ab
origine
a
fool
one
becomes
so
more
than
ever
seeing
that
however
much
one
may
try
not
to
forget
what
one
has
learnt
there
will
dawn
upon
one
sooner
or
later
the
revelation
that
one
's
knowledge
is
all
rubbish
that
sensible
men
have
ceased
to
engage
in
such
futilities
and
that
one
has
lagged
far
behind
the
times
But
in
such
a
case
what
is
one
to
do
Evidently
the
younger
generation
know
more
than
we
do
And
slowly
turning
on
his
heel
he
moved
away
as
slowly
with
Nikolai
Petrovitch
following
in
his
wake
Does
Paul
Petrovitch
always
reside
here
asked
Bazarov
when
the
door
had
closed
upon
the
pair
Yes
he
does
But
look
here
Evgenii
You
adopted
too
sharp
a
tone
with
my
uncle
You
have
offended
him
What
Am
I
to
fawn
upon
these
rustic
aristocrats
even
though
their
attitude
is
one
purely
of
conceit
and
subservience
to
custom
If
such
be
Paul
Petrovitch
's
bent
he
had
better
have
continued
his
career
in
St
Petersburg
Never
mind
him
however
Do
you
know
I
have
found
a
splendid
specimen
of
the
water
beetle
dytiscus
marginatus
Are
you
acquainted
with
it
I
will
show
it
you
Did
I
not
promise
to
tell
you
his
history
observed
Arkady
musingly
Whose
history
The
water
beetle
's
No
my
uncle
's
At
least
you
will
see
from
it
that
he
is
not
the
man
you
take
him
for
but
a
man
who
deserves
pity
rather
than
ridicule
I
am
not
prepared
to
dispute
it
But
how
come
you
to
be
so
devoted
to
him
Always
one
ought
to
be
fair
The
connection
I
do
not
see
Then
listen
And
Arkady
related
the
story
to
be
found
in
the
following
chapter
1
Justus
Freiherr
von
Liebig
1803-1873
the
great
German
chemist
in
particular
the
founder
of
agricultural
chemistry
Like
his
brother
Paul
Petrovitch
Kirsanov
received
his
early
education
at
home
and
entered
the
Imperial
Corps
of
Pages
Distinguished
from
boyhood
for
his
good
looks
he
had
in
addition
a
nature
of
the
self-confident
quizzical
amusingly
sarcastic
type
which
never
fails
to
please
As
soon
therefore
as
he
had
received
his
officer
's
commission
he
began
to
go
everywhere
in
society
to
set
the
pace
to
amuse
himself
to
play
the
rake
and
to
squander
his
money
Yet
these
things
somehow
consorted
well
with
his
personality
and
women
went
nearly
mad
over
him
while
men
called
him
'Fate
and
secretly
detested
him
Meanwhile
he
rented
a
flat
with
his
brother
for
whom
in
spite
of
their
dissimilarity
he
had
a
genuine
affection
The
dissimilarity
in
question
lay
among
other
things
in
the
fact
that
while
Nikolai
Petrovitch
halted
had
small
kindly
rather
melancholy
features
and
narrow
black
eyes
and
was
of
a
disposition
prone
to
reading
omnivorously
to
bestirring
himself
but
little
and
to
feeling
nervous
when
attending
social
functions
Paul
Petrovitch
never
spent
a
single
evening
at
home
but
was
renowned
for
his
physical
dexterity
and
daring
he
it
was
who
made
gymnastics
the
rage
among
the
gilded
youth
of
his
day
and
read
at
most
five
or
six
French
novels
Indeed
by
the
time
that
he
reached
his
twenty-eighth
year
Paul
had
risen
to
be
a
captain
and
before
him
there
seemed
to
lie
a
brilliant
career
but
everything
suddenly
underwent
a
change
as
shall
be
related
forthwith
Among
the
society
of
St
Petersburg
of
that
period
there
was
accustomed
to
appear
and
to
disappear
at
irregular
intervals
a
certain
Princess
R
whose
memory
survives
to
this
day
Though
wedded
to
a
highly
placed
and
very
presentable
albeit
slightly
stupid
husband
she
had
no
children
and
spent
her
time
between
making
unexpected
visits
abroad
and
unexpected
returns
to
Russia
In
short
she
led
a
very
curious
life
and
the
world
in
general
accounted
her
a
coquette
in
that
she
devoted
herself
to
every
sort
of
pleasure
and
danced
at
balls
until
she
could
dance
no
more
and
laughed
and
jested
with
young
men
whom
she
received
before
dinner
in
the
half-light
of
a
darkened
drawing-room
Yet
strangely
enough
as
the
night
advanced
she
would
fall
to
weeping
and
praying
and
wringing
her
hands
and
unable
to
rest
would
pace
her
room
until
break
of
day
or
sit
huddled
pale
and
cold
over
the
Psalter
But
no
sooner
would
daylight
have
appeared
than
she
would
once
more
become
a
woman
of
the
world
and
drive
and
laugh
and
chatter
and
fling
herself
upon
anything
which
seemed
to
offer
any
sort
of
distraction
Also
her
power
to
charm
was
extraordinary
for
though
no
one
could
have
called
her
a
beauty
seeing
that
the
one
good
feature
of
her
face
lay
in
her
eyes
and
even
then
it
was
not
the
small
grey
eyes
themselves
which
attracted
but
the
glance
which
they
emitted
she
had
hair
of
the
colour
and
weight
of
gold
which
reached
to
her
knees
That
glance
it
was
a
glance
which
could
be
careless
to
the
point
of
daring
or
meditative
to
the
point
of
melancholy
a
glance
so
enigmatical
that
even
when
her
tongue
was
lisping
fatuous
nonsense
there
gleamed
in
her
aspect
something
intangible
and
out
of
the
common
Finally
she
dressed
with
exquisite
taste
This
woman
Paul
Petrovitch
met
at
a
ball
and
at
it
he
danced
a
mazurka
with
her
Yet
though
during
the
dance
she
uttered
not
a
single
word
of
sense
he
straightway
fell
in
love
with
her
and
being
a
man
accustomed
to
conquests
attained
his
end
in
this
case
also
Yet
strangely
enough
the
facility
of
his
triumph
in
no
way
chilled
him
but
led
him
on
to
become
more
and
more
resolutely
more
and
more
painfully
attached
and
that
though
she
was
a
woman
in
whom
even
after
she
had
made
the
great
surrender
there
still
remained
something
as
immutably
veiled
as
radically
intangible
as
before
something
which
no
one
had
yet
succeeded
in
penetrating
What
was
in
that
soul
God
alone
knows
Almost
would
it
seem
as
though
she
were
subservient
to
a
mysterious
force
of
which
the
existence
was
absolutely
unknown
to
her
but
which
sported
with
her
as
it
willed
and
whose
whims
her
mentality
was
powerless
to
control
At
all
events
her
conduct
constituted
a
series
of
inconsistencies
and
even
the
few
letters
which
she
wrote
to
Paul
Petrovitch
missives
which
would
undoubtedly
have
aroused
her
husband
's
suspicions
had
he
seen
them
were
written
to
a
man
who
was
practically
a
stranger
to
her
And
in
time
her
love
began
to
be
succeeded
by
fits
of
despondency
she
ceased
to
smile
and
jest
with
the
lover
whom
she
had
selected
and
looked
at
him
and
listened
to
his
voice
with
reluctance
In
fact
there
were
moments
for
the
most
part
unexpected
moments
when
this
reluctance
bordered
upon
chill
horror
and
her
face
assumed
a
wild
corpse-like
expression
and
she
would
shut
herself
up
in
her
bedroom
whence
her
maid
with
ear
glued
to
the
keyhole
would
hear
issue
sounds
as
of
dull
hopeless
sobbing
Paul
Petrovitch
himself
frequently
found
that
when
returning
home
after
one
of
these
tender
interviews
there
was
naught
within
his
breast
save
the
bitter
galling
sensation
which
comes
of
final
and
irrevocable
failure
'What
more
could
I
want
he
would
say
to
himself
in
his
bewilderment
yet
always
he
spoke
with
an
aching
heart
It
happened
that
on
one
occasion
he
gave
her
a
ring
having
a
stone
carved
in
the
figure
of
the
Sphinx
'What
she
exclaimed
'Do
you
offer
me
the
Sphinx
'I
do
he
replied
'The
Sphinx
is
yourself
'I
she
queried
with
a
slow
lift
of
her
enigmatical
eyes
'You
are
indeed
flattering
With
the
words
went
the
ghost
of
a
smile
while
her
eyes
looked
stranger
than
ever
Even
during
the
time
that
the
Princess
loved
him
things
were
difficult
for
Paul
Petrovitch
but
when
she
cooled
in
her
affection
for
him
as
soon
happened
he
came
near
to
going
out
of
his
mind
Distracted
with
jealousy
he
allowed
her
no
rest
but
followed
her
to
such
an
extent
that
at
length
worn
out
with
his
persistent
overtures
she
betook
herself
on
a
tour
abroad
Yet
even
then
Paul
Petrovitch
listened
to
neither
the
prayers
of
his
friends
nor
the
advice
of
his
superior
officers
but
resigning
his
commission
set
out
on
the
Princess's
track
Thus
four
years
were
spent
in
hunting
her
down
and
losing
sight
of
her
again
and
though
throughout
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
conduct
and
