a
chap
for
a
joke
Now
now
get
on
in
God's
name
I
did
not
speak
but
I
felt
happy
too
'We
are
safe
I
repeated
to
myself
and
lay
down
on
the
hay
'We
've
got
off
cheap
I
even
felt
rather
ashamed
that
I
had
remembered
that
line
of
Zhukovsky
's
Suddenly
an
idea
occurred
to
me
'Filofey
'What
is
it
'Are
you
married
'Yes
'And
have
you
children
'Yes
'How
was
it
you
did
n't
think
of
them
You
were
sorry
for
your
horses
were
n't
you
sorry
for
your
wife
and
children
'Why
be
sorry
for
them
They
were
n't
going
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
thieves
you
know
But
I
kept
them
in
my
mind
all
the
while
and
I
do
now
surely
Filofey
paused
'May
be
it
was
for
their
sake
Almighty
God
had
mercy
on
us
'But
if
they
were
n't
highwaymen
'How
can
we
tell
Can
one
creep
into
the
soul
of
another
Another's
soul
we
know
is
a
dark
place
But
with
the
thought
of
God
in
the
heart
things
are
always
better
No
no
I
'd
my
family
all
the
time
Gee
gee-up
little
ones
in
God
's
name
It
was
already
almost
daylight
we
began
to
drive
into
Tula
I
was
lying
dreamy
and
half-asleep
'Master
Filofey
said
to
me
suddenly
'look
there
they
're
stopping
at
the
tavern
their
cart
I
raised
my
head
there
they
were
and
their
cart
and
horses
In
the
doorway
of
the
drinking-house
there
suddenly
appeared
our
friend
the
giant
in
the
cape
'Sir
he
shouted
waving
his
cap
'we
're
drinking
your
health
Hey
coachman
he
added
wagging
his
head
at
Filofey
'you
were
a
bit
scared
I
should
n't
wonder
hey
'A
merry
fellow
observed
Filofey
when
we
had
driven
nearly
fifty
yards
from
the
tavern
We
got
into
Tula
at
last
I
bought
shot
and
while
I
was
about
it
tea
and
spirits
and
even
got
a
horse
from
the
horse-dealer
At
mid-day
we
set
off
home
again
As
we
drove
by
the
place
where
we
first
heard
the
rattle
of
the
cart
behind
us
Filofey
who
having
had
something
to
drink
at
Tula
turned
out
to
be
very
talkative
he
even
began
telling
me
fairy-tales
as
he
passed
the
place
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
'Do
you
remember
master
how
I
kept
saying
to
you
A
rattle
a
rattle
of
wheels
I
said
He
waved
his
hand
several
times
This
expression
struck
him
as
most
amusing
The
same
evening
we
got
back
to
his
village
I
related
the
adventure
that
had
befallen
us
to
Yermola
Being
sober
he
expressed
no
sympathy
he
only
gave
a
grunt
whether
of
approval
or
reproach
I
imagine
he
did
not
know
himself
But
two
days
later
he
informed
me
with
great
satisfaction
that
the
very
night
Filofey
and
I
had
been
driving
to
Tula
and
on
the
very
road
a
merchant
had
been
robbed
and
murdered
I
did
not
at
first
put
much
faith
in
this
but
later
on
I
was
obliged
to
believe
it
it
was
confirmed
by
the
police
captain
who
came
galloping
over
in
consequence
Was
not
that
perhaps
the
'wedding
our
brave
spirits
were
returning
from
was
n't
that
the
'fine
fellow
they
had
'put
to
bed
in
the
words
of
the
jocose
giant
I
stayed
five
days
longer
in
Filofey
's
village
Whenever
I
meet
him
I
always
say
to
him
'A
rattle
of
wheels
Eh
'A
merry
fellow
he
always
answers
and
bursts
out
laughing
EPILOGUE
THE
FOREST
AND
THE
STEPPE
'And
slowly
something
began
to
draw
him
Back
to
the
country
to
the
garden
dark
Where
lime-trees
are
so
huge
so
full
of
shade
And
lilies
of
the
valley
sweet
as
maids
Where
rounded
willows
o'er
the
water
's
edge
Lean
from
the
dyke
in
rows
and
where
the
oak
Sturdily
grows
above
the
sturdy
field
Amid
the
smell
of
hemp
and
nettles
rank
There
there
in
meadows
stretching
wide
Where
rich
and
black
as
velvet
is
the
earth
Where
the
sweet
rye
far
as
the
eye
can
see
Moves
noiselessly
in
tender
billowing
waves
And
where
the
heavy
golden
light
is
shed
From
out
of
rounded
white
transparent
clouds
There
it
is
good
From
a
poem
devoted
to
the
flames
The
reader
is
very
likely
already
weary
of
my
sketches
I
hasten
to
reassure
him
by
promising
to
confine
myself
to
the
fragments
already
printed
but
I
can
not
refrain
from
saying
a
few
words
at
parting
about
a
sportman
's
life
Hunting
with
a
dog
and
a
gun
is
delightful
in
itself
f
r
sich
as
they
used
to
say
in
old
days
but
let
us
suppose
you
were
not
born
a
sportsman
but
are
fond
of
nature
all
the
same
you
can
not
then
help
envying
us
sportsmen
Listen
Do
you
know
for
instance
the
delight
of
setting
off
before
daybreak
in
spring
You
come
out
on
to
the
steps
In
the
dark
grey
sky
stars
are
twinkling
here
and
there
a
damp
breeze
in
faint
gusts
flies
to
meet
you
now
and
then
there
is
heard
the
secret
vague
whispering
of
the
night
the
trees
faintly
rustle
wrapt
in
darkness
And
now
they
pull
the
hood
over
the
cart
and
lay
a
box
with
the
samovar
at
your
feet
The
trace-horses
move
restlessly
snort
and
daintily
paw
the
ground
a
couple
of
white
geese
only
just
awake
waddle
slowly
and
silently
across
the
road
On
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
in
the
garden
the
watchman
is
snoring
peacefully
every
sound
seems
to
stand
still
in
the
frozen
air
suspended
not
moving
You
take
your
seat
the
horses
start
at
once
the
cart
rolls
off
with
a
loud
rumble
You
drive
drive
past
the
church
downhill
to
the
right
across
the
dyke
The
pond
is
just
beginning
to
be
covered
with
mist
You
are
rather
chilly
you
cover
your
face
with
the
collar
of
your
fur
cloak
you
doze
The
horse
's
hoofs
splash
sonorously
through
the
puddles
the
coachman
begins
to
whistle
But
by
now
you
have
driven
over
three
miles
the
rim
of
the
sky
flushes
crimson
the
jackdaws
are
heard
fluttering
clumsily
in
the
birch-trees
sparrows
are
twittering
about
the
dark
hayricks
The
air
is
clearer
the
road
more
distinct
the
sky
brightens
the
clouds
look
whiter
and
the
fields
look
greener
In
the
huts
there
is
the
red
light
of
flaming
chips
from
behind
gates
comes
the
sound
of
sleepy
voices
And
meanwhile
the
glow
of
dawn
is
beginning
already
streaks
of
gold
are
stretching
across
the
sky
mists
are
gathering
in
clouds
over
the
ravines
the
larks
are
singing
musically
the
breeze
that
ushers
in
the
dawn
is
blowing
and
slowly
the
purple
sun
floats
upward
There
is
a
perfect
flood
of
light
your
heart
is
fluttering
like
a
bird
Everything
is
fresh
gay
delightful
One
can
see
a
long
way
all
round
That
way
beyond
the
copse
a
village
there
further
another
with
a
white
church
and
there
a
birch-wood
on
the
hill
behind
it
the
marsh
for
which
you
are
bound
Quicker
horses
quicker
Forward
at
a
good
trot
There
are
three
miles
to
go
not
more
The
sun
mounts
swiftly
higher
the
sky
is
clear
It
will
be
a
glorious
day
A
herd
of
cattle
comes
straggling
from
the
village
to
meet
us
You
go
up
the
hill
What
a
view
The
river
winds
for
ten
miles
dimly
blue
through
the
mist
beyond
it
meadows
of
watery
green
beyond
the
meadows
sloping
hills
in
the
distance
the
plovers
are
wheeling
with
loud
cries
above
the
marsh
through
the
moist
brilliance
suffused
in
the
air
the
distance
stands
out
clearly
not
as
in
the
summer
How
freely
one
drinks
in
the
air
how
quickly
the
limbs
move
how
strong
is
the
whole
man
clasped
in
the
fresh
breath
of
spring
And
a
summer
morning
a
morning
in
July
Who
but
the
sportsman
knows
how
soothing
it
is
to
wander
at
daybreak
among
the
underwoods
The
print
of
your
feet
lies
in
a
green
line
on
the
grass
white
with
dew
You
part
the
drenched
bushes
you
are
met
by
a
rush
of
the
warm
fragrance
stored
up
in
the
night
the
air
is
saturated
with
the
fresh
bitterness
of
wormwood
the
honey
sweetness
of
buckwheat
and
clover
in
the
distance
an
oak
wood
stands
like
a
wall
and
glows
and
glistens
in
the
sun
it
is
still
fresh
but
already
the
approach
of
heat
is
felt
The
head
is
faint
and
dizzy
from
the
excess
of
sweet
scents
The
copse
stretches
on
endlessly
Only
in
places
there
are
yellow
glimpses
in
the
distance
of
ripening
rye
and
narrow
streaks
of
red
buckwheat
Then
there
is
the
creak
of
cart-wheels
a
peasant
makes
his
way
among
the
bushes
at
a
walking-pace
and
sets
his
horse
in
the
shade
before
the
heat
of
the
day
You
greet
him
and
turn
away
the
musical
swish
of
the
scythe
is
heard
behind
you
The
sun
rises
higher
and
higher
The
grass
is
speedily
dry
And
now
it
is
quite
sultry
One
hour
passes
another
The
sky
grows
dark
over
the
horizon
the
still
air
is
baked
with
piercing
heat
'Where
can
one
get
a
drink
here
brother
you
inquire
of
the
mower
'Yonder
in
the
ravine
's
a
well
Through
the
thick
hazel-bushes
tangled
by
the
clinging
grass
you
drop
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
Right
under
the
cliff
a
little
spring
is
hidden
an
oak
bush
greedily
spreads
out
its
twigs
like
great
fingers
over
the
water
great
silvery
bubbles
rise
trembling
from
the
bottom
covered
with
fine
velvety
moss
You
fling
yourself
on
the
ground
you
drink
but
you
are
too
lazy
to
stir
You
are
in
the
shade
you
drink
in
the
damp
fragrance
you
take
your
ease
while
the
bushes
face
you
glowing
and
as
it
were
turning
yellow
in
the
sun
But
what
is
that
There
is
a
sudden
flying
gust
of
wind
the
air
is
astir
all
about
you
was
not
that
thunder
Is
it
the
heat
thickening
Is
a
storm
coming
on
And
now
there
is
a
faint
flash
of
lightning
Ah
this
is
a
storm
The
sun
is
still
blazing
you
can
still
go
on
hunting
But
the
storm-cloud
grows
its
front
edge
drawn
out
like
a
long
sleeve
bends
over
into
an
arch
The
grass
the
bushes
everything
around
grows
dark
Make
haste
over
there
you
think
you
catch
sight
of
a
hay
barn
make
haste
You
run
there
go
in
What
rain
What
flashes
of
lightning
The
water
drips
in
through
some
hole
in
the
thatch-roof
on
to
the
sweet-smelling
hay
But
now
the
sun
is
shining
bright
again
The
storm
is
over
you
come
out
My
God
the
joyous
sparkle
of
everything
the
fresh
limpid
air
the
scent
of
raspberries
and
mushrooms
And
then
the
evening
comes
on
There
is
the
blaze
of
fire
glowing
and
covering
half
the
sky
The
sun
sets
the
air
near
has
a
peculiar
transparency
as
of
crystal
over
the
distance
lies
a
soft
warm-looking
haze
with
the
dew
a
crimson
light
is
shed
on
the
fields
lately
plunged
in
floods
of
limpid
gold
from
trees
and
bushes
and
high
stacks
of
hay
run
long
shadows
The
sun
has
set
a
star
gleams
and
quivers
in
the
fiery
sea
of
the
sunset
and
now
it
pales
the
sky
grows
blue
the
separate
shadows
vanish
the
air
is
plunged
in
darkness
It
is
time
to
turn
homewards
to
the
village
to
the
hut
where
you
will
stay
the
night
Shouldering
your
gun
you
move
briskly
in
spite
of
fatigue
Meanwhile
the
night
comes
on
now
you
can
not
see
twenty
paces
from
you
the
dogs
show
faintly
white
in
the
dark
Over
there
above
the
black
bushes
there
is
a
vague
brightness
on
the
horizon
What
is
it
a
fire
No
it
is
the
moon
rising
And
away
below
to
the
right
the
village
lights
are
twinkling
already
And
here
at
last
is
your
hut
Through
the
tiny
window
you
see
a
table
with
a
white
cloth
a
candle
burning
supper
Another
time
you
order
the
racing
droshky
to
be
got
out
and
set
off
to
the
forest
to
shoot
woodcock
It
is
pleasant
making
your
way
along
the
narrow
path
between
two
high
walls
of
rye
The
ears
softly
strike
you
in
the
face
the
cornflowers
cling
round
your
legs
the
quails
call
around
the
horse
moves
along
at
a
lazy
trot
And
here
is
the
forest
all
shade
and
silence
Graceful
aspens
rustle
high
above
you
the
long-hanging
branches
of
the
birches
scarcely
stir
a
mighty
oak
stands
like
a
champion
beside
a
lovely
lime-tree
You
go
along
the
green
path
streaked
with
shade
great
yellow
flies
stay
suspended
motionless
in
the
sunny
air
and
suddenly
dart
away
midges
hover
in
a
cloud
bright
in
the
shade
dark
in
the
sun
the
birds
are
singing
peacefully
the
golden
little
voice
of
the
warbler
sings
of
innocent
babbling
joyousness
in
sweet
accord
with
the
scent
of
the
lilies
of
the
valley
Further
further
deeper
into
the
forest
the
forest
grows
more
dense
An
unutterable
stillness
falls
upon
the
soul
within
without
too
all
is
still
and
dreamy
But
now
a
wind
has
sprung
up
and
the
tree-tops
are
booming
like
falling
waves
Here
and
there
through
last
year
's
brown
leaves
grow
tall
grasses
funguses
stand
apart
under
their
wide-brimmed
hats
All
at
once
a
hare
skips
out
the
dog
scurries
after
it
with
a
resounding
bark
And
how
fair
is
this
same
forest
in
late
autumn
when
the
snipe
are
on
the
wing
They
do
not
keep
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
one
must
look
for
them
along
the
outskirts
There
is
no
wind
and
no
sun
no
light
no
shade
no
movement
no
sound
the
autumn
perfume
like
the
perfume
of
wine
is
diffused
in
the
soft
air
a
delicate
haze
hangs
over
the
yellow
fields
in
the
distance
The
still
sky
is
a
peacefully
untroubled
white
through
the
bare
brown
branches
in
parts
on
the
limes
hang
the
last
golden
leaves
The
damp
earth
is
elastic
under
your
feet
the
high
dry
blades
of
grass
do
not
stir
long
threads
lie
shining
on
the
blanched
turf
white
with
dew
You
breathe
tranquilly
but
there
is
a
strange
tremor
in
the
soul
You
walk
along
the
forest
's
edge
look
after
your
dog
and
meanwhile
loved
forms
loved
faces
dead
and
living
come
to
your
mind
long
long
slumbering
impressions
unexpectedly
awaken
the
fancy
darts
off
and
soars
like
a
bird
and
all
moves
so
clearly
and
stands
out
before
your
eyes
The
heart
at
one
time
throbs
and
beats
plunging
passionately
forward
at
another
it
is
drowned
beyond
recall
in
memories
Your
whole
life
as
it
were
unrolls
lightly
and
rapidly
before
you
a
man
at
such
times
possesses
all
his
past
all
his
feelings
and
his
powers
all
his
soul
and
there
is
nothing
around
to
hinder
him
no
sun
no
wind
no
sound
And
a
clear
rather
cold
autumn
day
with
a
frost
in
the
morning
when
the
birch
all
golden
like
some
tree
in
a
fairy
tale
stands
out
picturesquely
against
the
pale
blue
sky
when
the
sun
standing
low
in
the
sky
does
not
warm
but
shines
more
brightly
than
in
summer
the
small
aspen
copse
is
all
a-sparkle
through
and
through
as
though
it
were
glad
and
at
ease
in
its
nakedness
the
hoar-frost
is
still
white
at
the
bottom
of
the
hollows
while
a
fresh
wind
softly
stirs
up
and
drives
before
it
the
falling
crumpled
leaves
when
blue
ripples
whisk
gladly
along
the
river
lifting
rhythmically
the
heedless
geese
and
ducks
in
the
distance
the
mill
creaks
half-hidden
by
the
willows
and
with
changing
colours
in
the
clear
air
the
pigeons
wheel
in
swift
circles
above
it
Sweet
too
are
dull
days
in
summer
though
the
sportsmen
do
not
like
them
On
such
days
one
ca
n't
shoot
the
bird
that
flutters
up
from
under
your
very
feet
and
vanishes
at
once
in
the
whitish
dark
of
the
hanging
fog
But
how
peaceful
how
unutterably
peaceful
it
is
everywhere
Everything
is
awake
and
everything
is
hushed
You
pass
by
a
tree
it
does
not
stir
a
leaf
it
is
musing
in
repose
Through
the
thin
steamy
mist
evenly
diffused
in
the
air
there
is
a
long
streak
of
black
before
you
You
take
it
for
a
neighbouring
copse
close
at
hand
you
go
up
the
copse
is
transformed
into
a
high
row
of
wormwood
in
the
boundary-ditch
Above
you
around
you
on
all
sides
mist
But
now
a
breeze
is
faintly
astir
a
patch
of
pale-blue
sky
peeps
dimly
out
through
the
thinning
as
it
were
smoky
mist
a
ray
of
golden
yellow
sunshine
breaks
out
suddenly
flows
in
a
long
stream
strikes
on
the
fields
and
in
the
copse
and
now
everything
is
overcast
again
For
long
this
struggle
is
drawn
out
but
how
unutterably
brilliant
and
magnificent
the
day
becomes
when
at
last
light
triumphs
and
the
last
waves
of
the
warmed
mist
here
unroll
and
are
drawn
out
over
the
plains
there
wind
away
and
vanish
into
the
deep
tenderly
shining
heights
Again
you
set
off
into
outlying
country
to
the
steppe
For
some
ten
miles
you
make
your
way
over
cross-roads
and
here
at
last
is
the
high-road
Past
endless
trains
of
waggons
past
wayside
taverns
with
the
hissing
samovar
under
a
shed
wide-open
gates
and
a
well
from
one
hamlet
to
another
across
endless
fields
alongside
green
hempfields
a
long
long
time
you
drive
The
magpies
flutter
from
willow
to
willow
peasant
women
with
long
rakes
in
their
hands
wander
in
the
fields
a
man
in
a
threadbare
nankin
overcoat
with
a
wicker
pannier
over
his
shoulder
trudges
along
with
weary
step
a
heavy
country
coach
harnessed
with
six
tall
broken-winded
horses
rolls
to
meet
you
The
corner
of
a
cushion
is
sticking
out
of
a
window
and
on
a
sack
up
behind
hanging
on
to
a
string
perches
a
groom
in
a
fur-cloak
splashed
with
mud
to
his
very
eyebrows
And
here
is
the
little
district
town
with
its
crooked
little
wooden
houses
its
endless
fences
its
empty
stone
shops
its
old-fashioned
bridge
over
a
deep
ravine
On
on
The
steppe
country
is
reached
at
last
You
look
from
a
hill-top
what
a
view
Round
low
hills
tilled
and
sown
to
their
very
tops
are
seen
in
broad
undulations
ravines
overgrown
with
bushes
wind
coiling
among
them
small
copses
are
scattered
like
oblong
islands
from
village
to
village
run
narrow
paths
churches
stand
out
white
between
willow-bushes
glimmers
a
little
river
in
four
places
dammed
up
by
dykes
far
off
in
a
field
in
a
line
an
old
manor-house
with
its
outhouses
fruit-garden
and
threshing-floor
huddles
close
up
to
a
small
lake
But
on
on
you
go
The
hills
are
smaller
and
ever
smaller
there
is
scarcely
a
tree
to
be
seen
Here
it
is
at
last
the
boundless
untrodden
steppe
And
on
a
winter
day
to
walk
over
the
high
snowdrifts
after
hares
to
breathe
the
keen
frosty
air
while
half-closing
the
eyes
involuntarily
at
the
fine
blinding
sparkle
of
the
soft
snow
to
admire
the
emerald
sky
above
the
reddish
forest
And
the
first
spring
day
when
everything
is
shining
and
breaking
up
when
across
the
heavy
streams
from
the
melting
snow
there
is
already
the
scent
of
the
thawing
earth
when
on
the
bare
thawed
places
under
the
slanting
sunshine
the
larks
are
singing
confidingly
and
with
glad
splash
and
roar
the
torrents
roll
from
ravine
to
ravine
But
it
is
time
to
end
By
the
way
I
have
spoken
of
spring
in
spring
it
is
easy
to
part
in
spring
even
the
happy
are
drawn
away
to
the
distance
Farewell
reader
I
wish
you
unbroken
prosperity
and
much
against
the
grain
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
devote
a
few
years
to
setting
straight
those
domestic
circumstances
thanks
to
which
he
found
himself
in
the
wilds
of
the
country
Vyazovnin
found
his
estate
in
disorder
his
fields
and
gardens
run
to
waste
his
house
al
most
in
ruins
He
appointed
a
new
village
elder
and
diminished
the
allowances
of
the
house
serfs
He
had
two
or
three
rooms
cleared
for
his
own
use
and
ordered
new
shingles
to
be
put
on
where
the
roof
leaked
He
did
not
how
ever
take
any
violent
measures
and
did
not
de
I'ise
any
improvements
in
consequence
appar
ently
of
the
simple
reflection
that
one
must
at
any
rate
just
find
out
what
one
wants
to
im
prove
So
he
set
to
work
to
understand
the
farming
of
the
land
began
as
they
say
to
go
into
things
It
must
be
admitted
that
he
went
into
things
without
any
special
zeal
and
without
haste
Being
unaccustomed
to
country
life
he
found
it
very
dreary
and
often
could
not
think
where
and
how
to
spend
the
livelong
day
He
had
a
good
number
of
neighbours
but
he
was
not
acquainted
with
them
not
be
cause
he
avoided
them
but
because
he
had
not
happened
to
come
into
contact
with
them
But
at
last
in
the
autumn
he
did
make
the
acquaint
ance
of
one
of
his
nearest
neighbours
whose
name
was
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Krupitsyn
He
had
once
served
in
the
cavalry
and
had
left
the
army
a
Lieutenant
His
peasants
and
Vyazov
nin
's
had
had
a
dispute
from
time
immemorial
concerning
seven
acres
of
mowing
land
The
quarrel
from
time
to
time
reached
the
point
pf
fighting
cocks
of
hay
were
mysteriously
transferred
from
place
to
place
all
sorts
of
unpleasant
incidents
occurred
and
most
likely
the
quarrel
would
have
gone
on
for
many
years
longer
if
Krupitsyn
hearing
by
chance
of
Boris
Andreyitch
's
peaceable
disposition
had
not
gone
to
him
to
discuss
the
matter
in
person
The
interview
had
very
agreeable
results
in
the
first
place
the
trouble
was
settled
at
once
and
for
ever
to
the
mutual
satisfaction
of
the
land
owners
and
in
the
second
place
they
were
at
tracted
by
each
other
took
to
meeting
fre
quently
and
by
the
winter
had
become
such
friends
that
they
were
almost
inseparable
And
yet
they
had
little
in
common
Vyazov
nin
who
had
come
of
wealthy
parents
though
he
was
not
himself
wealthy
had
received
a
good
education
studied
at
the
University
knew
several
languages
was
fond
of
reading
and
al
together
might
be
regarded
as
a
man
of
culture
Krupitsyn
on
the
contrary
spoke
French
bad
ly
never
took
up
a
book
unless
he
was
obliged
and
belonged
rather
to
the
class
of
the
uncul
tivated
The
friends
had
little
resemblance
in
appearance
either
Vyazovnin
was
rather
tall
thin
fair
and
like
an
Englishman
he
kept
his
person
especially
his
hands
faultlessly
clean
was
elegant
in
his
dress
and
foppish
over
his
cravats
all
habits
formed
in
the
capital
Krupitsyn
on
the
other
hand
was
black-haired
and
dark-skinned
short
and
stooping
and
he
went
about
summer
and
winter
alike
in
a
sort
of
sack
overcoat
of
bronze-coloured
cloth
with
gaping
bulging
pockets
I
like
the
colour
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
used
to
say
because
it
does
n't
show
the
dirt
The
colour
of
the
cloth
certainly
did
not
show
the
dirt
but
the
cloth
itself
was
pretty
grimy
Vyazovnin
liked
dainty
fare
and
talked
with
zest
of
the
charms
of
good
dinners
and
the
importance
of
taste
Krupitsyn
ate
anything
that
was
given
him
so
long
as
it
was
something
he
could
work
upon
If
he
came
across
cab
bage
soup
with
boiled
grain
he
swallowed
the
soup
with
pleasure
and
ate
up
the
grain
that
went
with
it
if
he
were
offered
German
clear
soup
he
would
fall
upon
it
with
the
same
readi
ness
and
if
any
boiled
grain
were
at
hand
he
would
toss
it
into
the
same
plate
and
think
it
was
all
right
He
loved
kvass
to
use
his
own
expression
like
his
own
father
while
French
wines
especially
the
red
ones
he
could
not
endure
calling
them
vinegar
Altogether
Krupitsyn
was
very
far
from
being
fastidious
while
Vyazovnin
took
a
clean
handkerchief
twice
a
day
In
short
the
friends
as
we
have
said
already
were
not
alike
One
thing
they
had
in
common
they
were
both
what
is
called
good
fellows
straightforward
good-natured
young
men
Krupitsyn
had
been
born
one
while
Vyazovnin
had
become
one
Moreover
they
were
both
further
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
they
were
not
fond
of
anything
in
par
ticular
that
is
that
they
had
no
special
passion
or
predilection
for
anything
Krupitsyn
was
six
or
eight
years
older
than
Vyazovnin
Their
days
were
spent
rather
monotonously
As
a
rule
in
the
morning
not
very
early
how
ever
only
about
ten
o'clock
Boris
Andreyitch
would
be
sitting
with
a
book
and
a
cup
of
tea
by
the
window
combed
and
washed
in
a
hand
some
dressing-gown
hanging
open
unbuttoned
and
a
snow-white
shirt
the
door
would
open
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
in
his
usual
careless
at
tire
would
come
in
His
little
estate
was
less
than
half
a
mile
from
Vyazovno
as
Boris
Andreyitch
's
estate
was
called
though
indeed
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
very
often
stay
the
night
at
Boris
Andreyitch
's
Ah
good-morning
they
would
both
say
simultaneously
how
did
you
sleep
And
at
that
point
Fedyushka
a
boy
of
fif
teen
dressed
like
a
Cossack
whose
very
hair
bristling
like
the
feathers
of
a
ruff
in
the
mat
ing
season
looked
drowsy
would
bring
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
his
dressing-gown
of
Bokhara
stuff
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
after
clearing
his
throat
as
a
preliminary
would
swathe
himself
in
it
and
set
to
his
tea
and
his
pipe
Then
talk
would
begin
talk
without
haste
with
intervals
and
pauses
they
talked
of
the
weather
of
yesterday
of
the
work
of
the
fields
and
the
price
of
com
they
talked
too
of
the
neighbouring
landowners
and
their
ladies
In
the
early
days
of
his
acquaintance
with
Boris
Andreyitch
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
had
thought
it
his
duty
and
had
indeed
been
glad
of
the
op
portunity
to
question
his
neighbour
concerning
life
in
the
capital
and
learning
and
culture
generally
in
fact
concerning
lofty
subjects
Boris
Andreyitch
's
replies
had
interested
him
often
surprised
him
and
held
his
attention
but
at
the
same
time
they
had
brought
on
a
cer
tain
fatigue
so
that
all
such
conversations
were
quickly
dropped
and
indeed
Boris
Andreyitch
himself
displayed
no
excessive
desire
to
renew
them
It
happened
later
on
though
not
often
that
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
suddenly
ask
Boris
Andreyitch
for
example
what
sort
of
thing
the
electric
telegraph
was
and
after
listening
to
Boris
Andreyitch
's
not
perfectly
clear
ex
planation
would
sit
silent
for
a
little
and
then
say
Yes
that
's
wonderful
and
wou
d
make
no
enquiry
concerning
a
scientific
subject
for
a
long
time
afterwards
For
the
most
part
conversations
between
them
were
after
the
following
style
Pyotr
A'assilyitch
would
inhale
the
smoke
from
his
pipe
and
puffing
it
out
through
his
nostrils
would
ask
What
's
that
new
girl
you
've
got
I
saw
her
on
the
back
stairs
Boris
Andreyitch
Boris
Andreyitch
in
his
turn
would
put
his
cigar
to
his
lips
take
two
puffs
at
it
and
after
a
sip
of
cold
tea
with
cream
would
bring
out
What
new
girl
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
bend
down
a
little
to
one
side
and
looking
out
of
the
window
into
the
yard
where
the
dog
had
just
bitten
a
bare
foot
boy
in
the
calf
of
the
leg
would
reply
Fair-haired
not
bad
looking
Ah
Boris
Andreyitch
would
exclaim
after
a
pause
that
's
my
new
laundry
girl
Where
does
she
come
from
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
would
ask
as
though
surprised
From
Moscow
She
's
been
training
there
And
both
would
sit
silent
for
a
while
How
many
laundry
girls
have
you
got
al
together
Boris
Andreyitch
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
asks
again
looking
attentively
at
the
tobacco
burning
with
a
dry
splutter
under
the
charred
ash
in
his
pipe
Three
answers
Boris
Andreyitch
Three
I
've
only
one
and
there
's
scarcely
anything
for
the
one
to
do
of
course
as
you
know
we
do
n't
have
a
great
deal
of
washing
H
'm
answers
Boris
Andrtyitch
and
the
conversation
drops
for
a
time
The
morning
would
pass
in
such
occupations
and
lunch
time
would
arrive
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
particularly
fond
of
lunch
and
declared
that
twelve
o'clock
was
precisely
the
time
when
a
man
was
hungry
and
indeed
he
ate
at
that
hour
so
cheerfully
with
such
a
pleasant
and
hearty
appetite
that
even
a
German
would
have
been
delighted
looking
at
him
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
lunched
so
gloriously
Boris
Andrey
itch
ate
far
less
he
was
satisfied
with
a
cro
quette
of
chicken
or
a
couple
of
scrambled
eggs
with
butter
and
some
English
sauce
in
an
ingeniously
made
patent
jar
for
which
he
had
paid
a
great
deal
of
money
and
which
he
secretly
thought
disgusting
though
he
declared
that
he
could
not
touch
anything
without
it
If
the
weather
were
fine
the
two
friends
would
spend
the
time
between
lunch
and
dinner
look
ing
after
farming
operations
or
would
simply
go
for
a
walk
or
look
at
young
horses
being
broken
in
etc
Sometimes
they
made
their
way
as
far
as
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
estate
and
occa
sionally
went
into
his
little
house
The
house
small
and
very
old
was
more
like
a
plain
house-serf
's
cottage
than
a
land
owner
's
residence
Green
moss
grew
in
the
thatched
roof
which
was
honeycombed
with
the
nests
of
sparrows
and
jackdaws
One
of
the
aspen
log
walls
which
had
originally
been
tightly
fitted
had
dropped
back
while
the
others
had
shifted
to
one
side
and
sunk
into
the
earth
in
short
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
house
was
poor
without
and
poor
within
But
