a
darling
to
her
face
and
that
was
all
Any
kind
of
continuous
care
was
too
exhausting
for
the
indolent
lady
During
her
father
s
lifetime
Lisa
was
in
the
hands
of
a
governess
Mademoiselle
Moreau
from
Paris
after
his
death
she
passed
into
the
charge
of
Marfa
Timofyevna
Marfa
Timofyevna
the
reader
knows
already
Mademoiselle
Moreau
was
a
tiny
wrinkled
creature
with
little
bird-like
ways
and
a
bird
s
intellect
In
her
youth
she
had
led
a
very
dissipated
life
but
in
old
age
she
had
only
two
passions
left
gluttony
and
cards
When
she
had
eaten
her
fill
and
was
neither
playing
cards
nor
chattering
her
face
assumed
an
expression
almost
death-like
She
was
sitting
looking
breathing
yet
it
was
clear
that
there
was
not
an
idea
in
her
head
One
could
not
even
call
her
good-natured
Birds
are
not
good-natured
Either
as
a
result
of
her
frivolous
youth
or
of
the
air
of
Paris
which
she
had
breathed
from
childhood
a
kind
of
cheap
universal
scepticism
had
found
its
way
into
her
usually
expressed
by
the
words
tout
ca
c
est
des
betises
She
spoke
ungrammatically
but
in
a
pure
Parisian
jargon
did
not
talk
scandal
and
had
no
caprices
what
more
can
one
desire
in
a
governess
Over
Lisa
she
had
little
influence
all
the
stronger
was
the
influence
on
her
of
her
nurse
Agafya
Vlasyevna
This
woman
s
story
was
remarkable
She
came
of
a
peasant
family
She
was
married
at
sixteen
to
a
peasant
but
she
was
strikingly
different
from
her
peasant
sisters
Her
father
had
been
twenty
years
starosta
and
had
made
a
good
deal
of
money
and
he
spoiled
her
She
was
exceptionally
beautiful
the
best-dressed
girl
in
the
whole
district
clever
ready
with
her
tongue
and
daring
Her
master
Dmitri
Pestov
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
father
a
man
of
modest
and
gentle
character
saw
her
one
day
at
the
threshing-floor
talked
to
her
and
fell
passionately
in
love
with
her
She
was
soon
left
a
widow
Pestov
though
he
was
a
married
man
took
her
into
his
house
and
dressed
her
like
a
lady
Agafya
at
once
adapted
herself
to
her
new
position
just
as
if
she
had
never
lived
differently
all
her
life
She
grew
fairer
and
plumper
her
arms
grew
as
floury
white
under
her
muslin-sleeves
as
a
merchant
s
lady
s
the
samovar
never
left
her
table
she
would
wear
nothing
except
silk
or
velvet
and
slept
on
well-stuffed
feather-beds
This
blissful
existence
lasted
for
five
years
but
Dmitri
Pestov
died
his
widow
a
kind-hearted
woman
out
of
regard
for
the
memory
of
the
deceased
did
not
wish
to
treat
her
rival
unfairly
all
the
more
because
Agafya
had
never
forgotten
herself
in
her
presence
She
married
her
however
to
a
shepherd
and
sent
her
a
long
way
off
Three
years
passed
It
happened
one
hot
summer
day
that
her
mistress
in
driving
past
stopped
at
the
cattle-yard
Agafya
regaled
her
with
such
delicious
cool
cream
behaved
so
modestly
and
was
so
neat
so
bright
and
so
contented
with
everything
that
her
mistress
signified
her
forgiveness
to
her
and
allowed
her
to
return
to
the
house
Within
six
months
she
had
become
so
much
attached
to
her
that
she
raised
her
to
be
housekeeper
and
intrusted
the
whole
household
management
to
her
Agafya
again
returned
to
power
and
again
grew
plump
and
fair
her
mistress
put
the
most
complete
confidence
in
her
So
passed
five
years
more
Misfortune
again
overtook
Agafya
Her
husband
whom
she
had
promoted
to
be
a
footman
began
to
drink
took
to
vanishing
from
the
house
and
ended
by
stealing
six
of
the
mistress
silver
spoons
and
hiding
them
till
a
favourable
moment
in
his
wife
s
box
It
was
opened
He
was
sent
to
be
a
shepherd
again
and
Agafya
fell
into
disgrace
She
was
not
turned
out
of
the
house
but
was
degraded
from
housekeeper
to
being
a
sewing-woman
and
was
ordered
to
wear
a
kerchief
on
her
head
instead
of
a
cap
To
the
astonishment
of
every
one
Agafya
accepted
with
humble
resignation
the
blow
that
had
fallen
upon
her
She
was
at
that
time
about
thirty
all
her
children
were
dead
and
her
husband
did
not
live
much
longer
The
time
had
come
for
her
to
reflect
And
she
did
reflect
She
became
very
silent
and
devout
never
missed
a
single
matin
s
service
nor
a
single
mass
and
gave
away
all
her
fine
clothes
She
spent
fifteen
years
quietly
peacefully
and
soberly
never
quarrelling
with
any
one
and
giving
way
to
every
one
If
any
one
scolded
her
she
only
bowed
to
them
and
thanked
them
for
the
admonition
Her
mistress
had
long
ago
forgiven
her
raised
her
out
of
disgrace
and
made
her
a
present
of
a
cap
of
her
own
But
she
was
herself
unwilling
to
give
up
the
kerchief
and
always
wore
a
dark
dress
After
her
mistress
death
she
became
still
more
quiet
and
humble
A
Russian
readily
feels
fear
and
affection
but
it
is
hard
to
gain
his
respect
it
is
not
soon
given
nor
to
every
one
For
Agafya
every
one
in
the
home
had
great
respect
no
one
even
remembered
her
previous
sins
as
though
they
had
been
buried
with
the
old
master
When
Kalitin
became
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
husband
he
wanted
to
intrust
the
care
of
the
house
to
Agafya
But
she
refused
on
account
of
temptation
he
scolded
her
but
she
bowed
humbly
and
left
the
room
Kalitin
was
clever
in
understanding
men
he
understood
Agafya
and
did
not
forget
her
When
he
moved
to
the
town
he
gave
her
with
her
consent
the
place
of
nurse
to
Lisa
who
was
only
just
five
years
old
Lisa
was
at
first
frightened
by
the
austere
and
serious
face
of
her
new
nurse
but
she
soon
grew
used
to
her
and
began
to
love
her
She
was
herself
a
serious
child
Her
features
recalled
Kalitin
s
decided
and
regular
profile
only
her
eyes
were
not
her
father
s
they
were
lighted
up
by
a
gentle
attentiveness
and
goodness
rare
in
children
She
did
not
care
to
play
with
dolls
never
laughed
loudly
or
for
long
and
behaved
with
great
decorum
She
was
not
often
thoughtful
but
when
she
was
it
was
almost
always
with
some
reason
After
a
short
silence
she
usually
turned
to
some
grown-up
person
with
a
question
which
showed
that
her
brain
had
been
at
work
upon
some
new
impression
She
very
early
got
over
childish
lispings
and
by
the
time
she
was
four
years
old
spoke
perfectly
plainly
She
was
afraid
of
her
father
her
feeling
towards
her
mother
was
undefinable
she
was
not
afraid
of
her
nor
was
she
demonstrative
to
her
but
she
was
not
demonstrative
even
towards
Agafya
though
she
was
the
only
person
she
loved
Agafya
never
left
her
It
was
curious
to
see
them
together
Agafya
all
in
black
with
a
dark
handkerchief
on
her
head
her
face
thin
and
transparent
as
wax
but
still
beautiful
and
expressive
would
be
sitting
upright
knitting
a
stocking
Lisa
would
sit
at
her
feet
in
a
little
arm-chair
also
busied
over
some
kind
of
work
and
seriously
raising
her
clear
eyes
listening
to
what
Agafya
was
relating
to
her
And
Agafya
did
not
tell
her
stories
but
in
even
measured
accents
she
would
narrate
the
life
of
the
Holy
Virgin
the
lives
of
hermits
saints
and
holy
men
She
would
tell
Lisa
how
the
holy
men
lived
in
deserts
how
they
were
saved
how
they
suffered
hunger
and
want
and
did
not
fear
kings
but
confessed
Christ
how
fowls
of
the
air
brought
them
food
and
wild
beasts
listened
to
them
and
flowers
sprang
up
on
the
spots
where
their
blood
had
been
spilt
Wall-flowers
asked
Lisa
one
ay
she
was
very
fond
of
flowers
Agafya
spoke
to
Lisa
gravely
and
meekly
as
though
she
felt
herself
to
be
unworthy
to
utter
such
high
and
holy
words
Lisa
listened
to
her
and
the
image
of
the
all-seeing
all-knowing
God
penetrated
with
a
kind
of
sweet
power
into
her
very
soul
filling
it
with
pure
and
reverent
awe
but
Christ
became
for
her
something
near
well-known
almost
familiar
Agafya
taught
her
to
pray
also
Sometimes
she
wakened
Lisa
early
at
daybreak
dressed
her
hurriedly
and
took
her
in
secret
to
matins
Lisa
followed
her
on
tiptoe
almost
holding
her
breath
The
cold
and
twilight
of
the
early
morning
the
freshness
and
emptiness
of
the
church
the
very
secrecy
of
these
unexpected
expeditions
the
cautious
return
home
and
to
her
little
bed
all
these
mingled
impressions
of
the
forbidden
strange
and
holy
agitated
the
little
girl
and
penetrated
to
the
very
innermost
depths
of
her
nature
Agafya
never
censured
any
one
and
never
scolded
Lisa
for
being
naughty
When
she
was
displeased
at
anything
she
only
kept
silence
And
Lisa
understood
this
silence
with
a
child
s
quick-sightedness
she
knew
very
well
too
when
Agafya
was
displeased
with
other
people
Marya
Dmitrievna
or
Kalitin
himself
For
a
little
over
three
years
Agafya
waited
on
Lisa
then
Mademoiselle
Moreau
replaced
her
but
the
frivolous
Frenchwoman
with
her
cold
ways
and
exclamation
tout
ca
c
est
des
betises
could
never
dislodge
her
dear
nurse
from
Lisa
s
heart
the
seeds
that
had
been
dropped
into
it
had
become
too
deeply
rooted
Besides
though
Agafya
no
longer
waited
on
Lisa
she
was
still
in
the
house
and
often
saw
her
charge
who
believed
in
her
as
before
Agafya
did
not
however
get
on
well
with
Marfa
Timofyevna
when
she
came
to
live
in
the
Kalitins
house
Such
gravity
and
dignity
on
the
part
of
one
who
had
once
worn
the
motley
skirt
of
a
peasant
wench
displeased
the
impatient
and
self-willed
old
lady
Agafya
asked
leave
to
go
on
a
pilgrimage
and
she
never
came
back
There
were
dark
rumours
that
she
had
gone
off
to
a
retreat
of
sectaries
But
the
impression
she
had
left
in
Lisa
s
soul
was
never
obliterated
She
went
as
before
to
the
mass
as
to
a
festival
she
prayed
with
rapture
with
a
kind
of
restrained
and
shamefaced
transport
at
which
Marya
Dmitrievna
secretly
marvelled
not
a
little
and
even
Marfa
Timofyevna
though
she
did
not
restrain
Lisa
in
any
way
tried
to
temper
her
zeal
and
would
not
let
her
make
too
many
prostrations
to
the
earth
in
her
prayers
it
was
not
a
lady-like
habit
she
would
say
In
her
studies
Lisa
worked
well
that
is
to
say
perseveringly
she
was
not
gifted
with
specially
brilliant
abilities
or
great
intellect
she
could
not
succeed
in
anything
without
labour
She
played
the
piano
well
but
only
Lemm
knew
what
it
had
cost
her
She
had
read
little
she
had
not
words
of
her
own
but
she
had
her
own
ideas
and
she
went
her
own
way
It
was
not
only
on
the
surface
that
she
took
after
her
father
he
too
had
never
asked
other
people
what
was
to
be
done
So
she
had
grown
up
tranquilly
and
restfully
till
she
had
reached
the
age
of
nineteen
She
was
very
charming
without
being
aware
of
it
herself
Her
every
movement
was
full
of
spontaneous
somewhat
awkward
gracefulness
her
voice
had
the
silvery
ring
of
untouched
youth
the
least
feeling
of
pleasure
called
forth
an
enchanting
smile
on
her
lips
and
added
a
deep
light
and
a
kind
of
mystic
sweetness
to
her
kindling
eyes
Penetrated
through
and
through
by
a
sense
of
duty
by
the
dread
of
hurting
any
one
whatever
with
a
kind
and
tender
heart
she
had
loved
all
men
and
no
one
in
particular
God
only
she
had
loved
passionately
timidly
and
tenderly
Lavretsky
was
the
first
to
break
in
upon
her
peaceful
inner
life
Such
was
Lisa
On
the
following
day
at
twelve
o
clock
Lavretsky
set
off
to
the
Kalitins
On
the
way
he
met
Panshin
who
galloped
past
him
on
horseback
his
hat
pulled
down
to
his
very
eyebrows
At
the
Kalitins
Lavretsky
was
not
admitted
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
been
acquainted
with
them
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
resting
so
the
footman
informed
him
her
excellency
had
a
headache
Marfa
Timofyevna
and
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
were
not
at
home
Lavretsky
walked
round
the
garden
in
the
faint
hope
of
meeting
Lisa
but
he
saw
no
one
He
came
back
two
hours
later
and
received
the
same
answer
accompanied
by
a
rather
dubious
look
from
the
footman
Lavretsky
thought
it
would
be
unseemly
to
call
for
a
third
time
the
same
day
and
he
decided
to
drive
over
to
Vassilyevskoe
where
he
had
business
moreover
On
the
road
he
made
various
plans
for
the
future
each
better
than
the
last
but
he
was
overtaken
by
a
melancholy
mood
when
he
reached
his
aunt
s
little
village
He
fell
into
conversation
with
Anton
the
old
man
as
if
purposely
seemed
full
of
cheerless
fancies
He
told
Lavretsky
how
at
her
death
Glafira
Petrovna
had
bitten
her
own
arm
and
after
a
brief
pause
added
with
a
sigh
Every
man
dear
master
is
destined
to
devour
himself
It
was
late
when
Lavretsky
set
off
on
the
way
back
He
was
haunted
by
the
music
of
the
day
before
and
Lisa
s
image
returned
to
him
in
all
its
sweet
distinctness
he
mused
with
melting
tenderness
over
the
thought
that
she
loved
him
and
reached
his
little
house
in
the
town
soothed
and
happy
The
first
thing
that
struck
him
as
he
went
into
the
entrance
hall
was
a
scent
of
patchouli
always
distasteful
to
him
there
were
some
high
travelling-trunks
standing
there
The
face
of
his
groom
who
ran
out
to
meet
him
seemed
strange
to
him
Not
stopping
to
analyse
his
impressions
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
drawing
room
On
his
entrance
there
rose
from
the
sofa
a
lady
in
a
black
silk
dress
with
flounces
who
raising
a
cambric
handkerchief
to
her
pale
face
made
a
few
paces
forward
bent
her
carefully
dressed
perfumed
head
and
fell
at
his
feet
Then
only
he
recognised
her
this
lady
was
his
wife
He
caught
his
breath
He
leaned
against
the
wall
Theodore
do
not
repulse
me
she
said
in
French
and
her
voice
cut
to
his
heart
like
a
knife
He
looked
at
her
senselessly
and
yet
he
noticed
involuntarily
at
once
that
she
had
grown
both
whiter
and
fatter
Theodore
she
went
on
from
time
to
time
lifting
her
eyes
and
discreetly
wringing
her
marvellously-beautiful
fingers
with
their
rosy
polished
nails
Theodore
I
have
wronged
you
deeply
wronged
you
I
will
say
more
I
have
sinned
but
hear
me
I
am
tortured
by
remorse
I
have
grown
hateful
to
myself
I
could
endure
my
position
no
longer
how
many
times
have
I
thought
of
turning
to
you
but
I
feared
your
anger
I
resolved
to
break
every
tie
with
the
past
Puis
j
ai
ete
si
malade
I
have
been
so
ill
she
added
and
passed
her
hand
over
her
brow
and
cheek
I
took
advantage
of
the
widely-spread
rumour
of
my
death
I
gave
up
everything
without
resting
day
or
night
I
hastened
hither
I
hesitated
long
to
appear
before
you
my
judge
paraitre
devant
vous
mon
juge
but
I
resolved
at
last
remembering
your
constant
goodness
to
come
to
you
I
found
your
address
at
Moscow
Believe
me
she
went
on
slowly
getting
up
from
the
floor
and
sitting
on
the
very
edge
of
an
arm-chair
I
have
often
thought
of
death
and
I
should
have
found
courage
enough
to
take
my
life
ah
life
is
a
burden
unbearable
for
me
now
but
the
thought
of
my
daughter
my
little
Ada
stopped
me
She
is
here
she
is
asleep
in
the
next
room
the
poor
child
She
is
tired
you
shall
see
her
she
at
least
has
done
you
no
wrong
and
I
am
so
unhappy
so
unhappy
cried
Madame
Lavretsky
and
she
melted
into
tears
Lavretsky
came
to
himself
at
last
he
moved
away
from
the
wall
and
turned
towards
the
door
You
are
going
cried
his
wife
in
a
voice
of
despair
Oh
this
is
cruel
Without
uttering
one
word
to
me
not
even
a
reproach
This
contempt
will
kill
me
it
is
terrible
Lavretsky
stood
still
What
do
you
want
to
hear
from
me
he
articulated
in
an
expressionless
voice
Nothing
nothing
she
rejoined
quickly
I
know
I
have
no
right
to
expect
anything
I
am
not
mad
believe
me
I
do
not
hope
I
do
not
dare
to
hope
for
your
forgiveness
I
only
venture
to
entreat
you
to
command
me
what
I
am
to
do
where
I
am
to
live
Like
a
slave
I
will
fulfil
your
commands
whatever
they
may
be
I
have
no
commands
to
give
you
replied
Lavretsky
in
the
same
colourless
voice
you
know
all
is
over
between
us
and
now
more
than
ever
you
can
live
where
you
like
and
if
your
allowance
is
too
little
Ah
don
t
say
such
dreadful
things
Varvara
Pavlovna
interrupted
him
spare
me
if
only
if
only
for
the
sake
of
this
angel
And
as
she
uttered
these
words
Varvara
Pavlovna
ran
impulsively
into
the
next
room
and
returned
at
once
with
a
small
and
very
elegantly
dressed
little
girl
in
her
arms
Thick
flaxen
curls
fell
over
her
pretty
rosy
little
face
and
on
to
her
large
sleepy
black
eyes
she
smiled
and
blinked
her
eyes
at
the
light
and
laid
a
chubby
little
hand
on
her
mother
s
neck
Ada
vois
c
est
ton
pere
said
Varvara
Pavlovna
pushing
the
curls
back
from
her
eyes
and
kissing
her
vigorously
pre
le
avec
moi
C
est
ca
papa
stammered
the
little
girl
lisping
Oui
mon
enfant
n
est-ce
pas
que
tu
l
aimes
But
this
was
more
than
Lavretsky
could
stand
In
such
a
melodrama
must
there
really
be
a
scene
like
this
he
muttered
and
went
out
of
the
room
Varvara
Pavlovna
stood
still
for
some
time
in
the
same
place
slightly
shrugged
her
shoulders
carried
the
little
girl
off
into
the
next
room
undressed
her
and
put
her
to
bed
Then
she
took
up
a
book
and
sat
down
near
the
lamp
and
after
staying
up
for
an
hour
she
went
to
bed
herself
Eh
bien
madame
queried
her
maid
a
Frenchwoman
whom
she
had
brought
from
Paris
as
she
unlaced
her
corset
Eh
bien
Justine
se
replied
he
is
a
good
deal
older
but
I
fancy
he
is
just
the
same
good-natured
fellow
Give
me
my
gloves
for
the
night
and
get
out
my
grey
high-necked
dress
for
to-morrow
and
don
t
forget
the
mutton
cutlets
for
Ada
I
daresay
it
will
be
difficult
to
get
them
here
but
we
must
try
A
la
guerre
comme
a
la
guerre
replied
Justine
as
she
put
out
the
candle
For
more
than
two
hours
Lavretsky
wandered
about
the
streets
of
town
The
night
he
had
spent
in
the
outskirts
of
Paris
returned
to
his
mind
His
heart
was
bursting
and
his
head
dull
and
stunned
was
filled
again
with
the
same
dark
senseless
angry
thoughts
constantly
recurring
She
is
alive
she
is
here
he
muttered
with
ever
fresh
amazement
He
felt
that
he
had
lost
Lisa
His
wrath
choked
him
this
blow
had
fallen
too
suddenly
upon
him
How
could
he
so
readily
have
believed
in
the
nonsensical
gossip
of
a
journal
a
wretched
scrap
of
paper
Well
if
I
had
not
believed
it
he
thought
what
difference
would
it
have
made
I
should
not
have
known
that
Lisa
loved
me
she
would
not
have
known
it
herself
He
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
image
the
voice
the
eyes
of
his
wife
and
he
cursed
himself
he
cursed
everything
in
the
world
Wearied
out
he
went
towards
morning
to
Lemm
s
For
a
long
while
he
could
make
no
one
hear
at
last
at
a
window
the
old
man
s
head
appeared
in
a
nightcap
sour
wrinkled
and
utterly
unlike
the
inspired
austere
visage
which
twenty-four
hours
ago
had
looked
down
imperiously
upon
Lavretsky
in
all
the
dignity
of
artistic
grandeur
What
do
you
want
queried
Lemm
I
can
t
play
to
you
every
night
I
have
taken
a
decoction
for
a
cold
But
Lavretsky
s
face
apparently
struck
him
as
strange
the
old
man
made
a
shade
for
his
eyes
with
his
hand
took
a
look
at
his
elated
visitor
and
let
him
in
Lavretsky
went
into
the
room
and
sank
into
a
chair
The
old
man
stood
still
before
him
wrapping
the
skirts
of
his
shabby
striped
dressing-gown
around
him
shrinking
together
and
gnawing
his
lips
My
wife
is
here
Lavretsky
brought
out
He
raised
his
head
and
suddenly
broke
into
involuntary
laughter
Lemm
s
face
expressed
bewilderment
but
he
did
not
even
smile
only
wrapped
himself
closer
in
his
dressing-gown
Of
course
you
don
t
know
Lavretsky
went
on
I
had
imagined
I
read
in
a
paper
that
she
was
dead
O
oh
did
you
read
that
lately
asked
Lemm
Yes
lately
O
oh
repeated
the
old
man
raising
his
eyebrows
And
she
is
here
Yes
She
is
at
my
house
now
and
I
I
am
an
unlucky
fellow
And
he
laughed
again
You
are
an
unlucky
fellow
Lemm
repeated
slowly
Christopher
Fedoritch
began
Lavretsky
would
you
undertake
to
carry
a
note
for
me
H
m
May
I
know
to
whom
Lisavet
Ah
yes
yes
I
understand
Very
good
And
when
must
the
letter
be
received
To-morrow
as
early
as
possible
H
m
I
can
send
Katrine
my
cook
No
I
will
go
myself
And
you
will
bring
me
an
answer
Yes
I
will
bring
you
an
answer
Lemm
sighed
Yes
my
poor
young
friend
you
are
certainly
an
unlucky
young
man
Lavretsky
wrote
a
few
words
to
Lisa
He
told
her
of
his
wife
s
arrival
begged
her
to
appoint
a
meeting
with
him
then
he
flung
himself
on
the
narrow
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
the
old
man
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
kept
muttering
a
long
while
coughing
and
drinking
off
his
decoction
by
gulps
The
morning
came
they
both
got
up
With
strange
eyes
they
looked
at
one
another
At
that
moment
Lavretsky
longed
to
kill
himself
The
cook
Katrine
brought
them
some
villainous
coffee
It
struck
eight
Lemm
put
on
his
hat
and
saying
that
he
was
going
to
give
a
lesson
at
the
Kalitins
at
ten
but
he
could
find
a
suitable
pretext
for
going
there
now
he
set
off
Lavretsky
flung
himself
again
on
the
little
sofa
and
once
more
the
same
bitter
laugh
stirred
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
He
thought
of
how
his
wife
had
driven
him
out
of
his
house
he
imagined
Lisa
s
position
covered
his
eyes
and
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
At
last
Lemm
came
back
and
brought
him
a
scrap
of
paper
on
which
Lisa
had
scribbled
in
pencil
the
following
words
We
can
not
meet
to-day
perhaps
to-morrow
evening
Good-bye
Lavretsky
thanked
Lemm
briefly
and
indifferently
and
went
home
He
found
his
wife
at
breakfast
Ada
in
curl-papers
in
a
little
white
frock
with
blue
ribbons
was
eating
her
mutton
cutlet
Varvara
Pavlovna
rose
at
once
directly
Lavretsky
entered
the
room
and
went
to
meet
him
with
humility
in
her
face
He
asked
her
to
follow
him
into
the
study
shut
the
door
after
them
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
she
sat
down
modestly
laying
one
hand
over
the
other
and
began
to
follow
his
movements
with
her
eyes
which
were
still
beautiful
though
they
were
pencilled
lightly
under
their
lids
For
some
time
Lavretsky
could
not
speak
he
felt
that
he
could
not
master
himself
he
saw
clearly
that
Varvara
Pavlovna
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
him
but
was
assuming
an
appearance
of
being
ready
to
faint
away
in
another
instant
Listen
madam
he
began
at
last
breathing
with
difficulty
and
at
moments
setting
his
teeth
it
is
useless
for
us
to
make
pretense
with
one
another
I
don
t
believe
in
your
penitence
and
even
if
it
were
sincere
to
be
with
you
again
to
live
with
you
would
be
impossible
for
me
Varvara
Pavlovna
bit
her
lips
and
half-closed
her
eyes
It
is
aversion
she
thought
all
is
over
in
his
eyes
I
am
not
even
a
woman
Impossible
repeated
Lavretsky
fastening
the
top
buttons
of
his
coat
I
don
t
know
what
induced
you
to
come
here
I
suppose
you
have
come
to
the
end
of
your
money
Ah
you
hurt
me
whispered
Varvara
Pavlovna
However
that
may
be
you
are
any
way
my
wife
unhappily
I
can
not
drive
you
away
and
this
is
the
proposal
I
make
you
You
may
to-day
if
you
like
set
off
to
Lavriky
and
live
there
there
is
as
you
know
a
good
house
there
you
will
have
everything
you
need
in
addition
to
your
allowance
Do
you
agree
Varvara
Pavlovna
raised
an
embroidered
handkerchief
to
her
face
I
have
told
you
already
she
said
her
lips
twitching
nervously
that
I
will
consent
to
whatever
you
think
fit
to
do
with
me
at
present
it
only
remains
for
me
to
beg
of
you
will
you
allow
me
at
least
to
thank
you
for
your
magnanimity
No
thanks
I
beg
it
is
better
without
that
Lavretsky
said
hurriedly
So
then
he
pursued
approaching
the
door
I
may
reckon
on
To-morrow
I
will
be
at
Lavriky
Varvara
Pavlovna
declared
rising
respectfully
from
her
place
But
Fedor
Ivanitch
She
no
longer
called
him
Theodore
What
do
you
want
I
know
I
have
not
yet
gained
any
right
to
forgiveness
may
I
hope
at
least
that
with
time
Ah
Varvara
Pavlovna
Lavretsky
broke
in
you
are
a
clever
woman
but
I
too
am
not
a
fool
I
know
that
you
don
t
want
forgiveness
in
the
least
And
I
have
forgiven
you
long
ago
but
there
was
always
a
great
gulf
between
us
I
know
how
to
submit
rejoined
Varvara
Pavlovna
bowing
her
head
I
have
not
forgotten
my
sin
I
should
not
have
been
surprised
if
I
had
learnt
that
you
even
rejoiced
at
the
news
of
my
death
she
added
softly
slightly
pointing
with
her
hand
to
the
copy
of
the
journal
which
was
lying
forgotten
by
Lavretsky
on
the
table
Fedor
Ivanitch
started
the
paper
had
been
marked
in
pencil
Varvara
Pavlovna
gazed
at
him
with
still
greater
humility
She
was
superb
at
that
moment
Her
grey
Parisian
gown
clung
gracefully
round
her
supple
almost
girlish
figure
her
slender
soft
neck
encircled
by
a
white
collar
her
bosom
gently
stirred
by
her
even
breathing
her
hands
innocent
of
bracelets
and
rings
her
whole
figure
from
her
shining
hair
to
the
tip
of
her
just
visible
little
shoe
was
so
artistic
Lavretsky
took
her
in
with
a
glance
of
hatred
scarcely
could
he
refrain
from
crying
Bravo
scarcely
could
he
refrain
from
felling
her
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
on
her
shapely
head
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
An
hour
later
he
had
started
for
Vassilyevskoe
and
two
hours
later
Varvara
Pavlovna
had
bespoken
the
best
carriage
in
the
town
had
put
on
a
simple
straw
hat
with
a
black
veil
and
a
modest
mantle
given
Ada
into
the
charge
of
Justine
and
set
off
to
the
Kalitins
From
the
inquiries
she
had
made
among
the
servants
she
had
learnt
that
her
husband
went
to
see
them
every
day
The
day
of
the
arrival
of
Lavretsky
s
wife
at
the
town
of
O
a
sorrowful
day
for
him
and
been
also
a
day
of
misery
for
Lisa
She
had
not
had
time
to
go
down-stairs
and
say
good-morning
to
her
mother
when
the
tramp
of
hoofs
was
heard
under
the
window
and
with
a
secret
dismay
she
saw
Panshin
riding
into
the
courtyard
He
has
come
so
early
for
a
final
explanation
she
thought
and
she
was
not
mistaken
After
a
turn
in
the
drawing-room
he
suggested
that
she
should
go
with
him
into
the
garden
and
then
asked
her
for
the
decision
of
his
fate
Lisa
summoned
up
all
her
courage
and
told
him
that
she
could
not
be
his
wife
He
heard
her
to
the
end
standing
on
one
side
of
her
and
pulling
his
hat
down
over
his
forehead
courteously
but
in
a
changed
voice
he
asked
her
Was
this
her
last
word
and
had
he
given
her
any
ground
for
such
a
change
in
her
views
then
pressed
his
hand
to
his
eyes
sighed
softly
and
abruptly
and
took
his
head
away
from
his
face
again
I
did
not
want
to
go
along
the
beaten
track
he
said
huskily
I
wanted
to
choose
a
wife
according
to
the
dictates
of
my
heart
but
it
seems
this
was
not
to
be
Farewell
fond
dream
He
made
Lisa
a
profound
bow
and
went
back
into
the
house
She
hoped
that
he
would
go
away
at
once
but
he
went
into
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
room
and
remained
nearly
an
hour
with
her
As
he
came
out
he
said
to
Lisa
Votre
mere
vous
appelle
adieu
a
jamais
mounted
his
horse
and
set
off
at
full
trot
from
the
very
steps
Lisa
went
in
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
found
her
in
tears
Panshin
had
informed
her
of
his
ill-luck
Do
you
want
to
be
the
death
of
me
Do
you
want
to
be
the
death
of
me
was
how
the
disconsolate
widow
began
her
lamentations
Whom
do
you
want
Wasn
t
he
good
enough
for
you
A
kammer-junker
not
interesting
He
might
have
married
any
Maid
of
Honour
he
liked
in
Petersburg
And
I
I
had
so
hoped
for
it
Is
it
long
that
you
have
changed
towards
him
How
has
this
misfortune
come
on
us
it
can
not
have
come
of
itself
Is
it
that
dolt
of
a
cousin
s
doing
A
nice
person
you
have
picked
up
to
advise
you
And
he
poor
darling
Marya
Dmitrievna
