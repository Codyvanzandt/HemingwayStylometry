This
reproach
seemed
to
stab
Harlov
to
the
heart
All
his
old
pride
came
back
to
him
with
a
rush
He
shook
himself
and
thrust
out
his
chin
I
am
not
a
man
madam
Natalia
Nikolaevna
to
complain
or
be
faint-hearted
he
began
sullenly
I
simply
wished
to
reveal
my
feelings
to
you
as
my
benefactress
and
a
person
I
respect
But
the
Lord
God
knows
here
he
raised
his
hand
high
above
his
head
that
this
globe
of
earth
may
crumble
to
pieces
before
I
will
go
back
from
my
word
or
here
he
positively
snorted
show
a
faint
heart
or
regret
what
I
have
done
I
had
good
reasons
be
sure
My
daughters
will
never
forget
their
duty
for
ever
and
ever
amen
My
mother
stopped
her
ears
What
s
this
for
my
good
sir
like
a
trumpet-blast
If
you
really
have
such
faith
in
your
family
well
praise
the
Lord
for
it
You
ve
quite
put
my
brains
in
a
whirl
Martin
Petrovitch
begged
pardon
sighed
twice
and
was
silent
My
mother
once
more
referred
to
Kiev
the
Optin
desert
and
Father
Makary
Harlov
assented
said
that
he
must
he
must
he
would
have
to
his
soul
and
that
was
all
He
did
not
regain
his
cheerfulness
before
he
went
away
From
time
to
time
he
clenched
and
unclenched
his
fist
looked
at
his
open
hand
said
that
what
he
feared
above
everything
was
dying
without
repentance
from
a
stroke
and
that
he
had
made
a
vow
to
himself
not
to
get
angry
as
anger
vitiated
his
blood
and
drove
it
to
his
head
Besides
he
had
now
withdrawn
from
everything
What
grounds
could
he
have
for
getting
angry
Let
other
people
trouble
themselves
now
and
vitiate
their
blood
As
he
took
leave
of
my
mother
he
looked
at
her
in
a
strange
way
mournfully
and
questioningly
and
suddenly
with
a
rapid
movement
drew
out
of
his
pocket
the
volume
of
The
Worker
s
Leisure-Hour
and
thrust
it
into
my
mother
s
hand
What
s
that
she
inquired
Read
here
he
said
hurriedly
where
the
corner
s
turned
down
about
death
It
seems
to
me
it
s
terribly
well
said
but
I
can
t
make
it
out
at
all
Can
t
you
explain
it
to
me
my
benefactress
I
ll
come
back
again
and
you
explain
it
me
With
these
words
Martin
Petrovitch
went
away
He
s
in
a
bad
way
he
s
in
a
bad
way
observed
my
mother
directly
he
had
disappeared
through
the
doorway
and
she
set
to
work
upon
the
Leisure-Hour
On
the
page
turned
down
by
Harlov
were
the
following
words
Death
is
a
grand
and
solemn
work
of
nature
It
is
nothing
else
than
that
the
spirit
inasmuch
as
it
is
lighter
finer
and
infinitely
more
penetrating
than
those
elements
under
whose
sway
it
has
been
subject
nay
even
than
the
force
of
electricity
itself
so
is
chemically
purified
and
striveth
upward
till
what
time
it
attaineth
an
equally
spiritual
abiding-place
for
itself
and
so
on
My
mother
read
this
passage
through
twice
and
exclaiming
Pooh
she
flung
the
book
away
Three
days
later
she
received
the
news
that
her
sister
s
husband
was
dead
and
set
off
to
her
sister
s
country-seat
taking
me
with
her
My
mother
proposed
to
spend
a
month
with
her
but
she
stayed
on
till
late
in
the
autumn
and
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
September
that
we
returned
to
our
own
estate
The
first
news
with
which
my
valet
Prokofy
greeted
me
he
regarded
himself
as
the
seignorial
huntsman
was
that
there
was
an
immense
number
of
wild
snipe
on
the
wing
and
that
in
the
birch-copse
near
Eskovo
Harlov
s
property
especially
they
were
simply
swarming
I
had
three
hours
before
me
till
dinner-time
I
promptly
seized
my
gun
and
my
game-bag
and
with
Prokofy
and
a
setter-dog
hastened
to
the
Eskovo
copse
We
certainly
did
find
a
great
many
wild
snipe
there
and
firing
about
thirty
charges
killed
five
As
I
hurried
homewards
with
my
booty
I
saw
a
peasant
ploughing
near
the
roadside
His
horse
had
stopped
and
with
tearful
and
angry
abuse
he
was
mercilessly
tugging
with
the
cord
reins
at
the
animal
s
head
which
was
bent
on
one
side
I
looked
attentively
at
the
luckless
beast
whose
ribs
were
all
but
through
its
skin
and
bathed
in
sweat
heaved
up
and
down
with
convulsive
irregular
movements
like
a
blacksmith
s
bellows
I
recognised
it
at
once
as
the
decrepit
old
mare
with
the
scar
on
her
shoulder
who
had
served
Martin
Petrovitch
so
many
years
Is
Mr
Harlov
living
I
asked
Prokofy
The
chase
had
so
completely
absorbed
us
that
up
to
that
instant
we
had
not
talked
of
anything
Yes
he
s
alive
Why
But
that
s
his
mare
isn
t
it
Do
you
mean
to
say
he
s
sold
her
His
mare
it
is
to
be
sure
but
as
to
selling
he
never
sold
her
But
they
took
her
away
from
him
and
handed
her
over
to
that
peasant
How
took
it
And
he
consented
They
never
asked
his
consent
Things
have
changed
here
in
your
absence
Prokofy
observed
With
a
faint
smile
in
response
to
my
look
of
amazement
worse
luck
My
goodness
yes
Now
Sletkin
s
master
and
orders
every
one
about
But
Martin
Petrovitch
Why
Martin
Petrovitch
has
become
the
very
last
person
here
you
may
say
He
s
on
bread
and
water
what
more
can
one
say
They
ve
crushed
him
altogether
Mark
my
words
they
ll
drive
him
out
of
the
house
The
idea
that
it
was
possible
to
drive
such
a
giant
had
never
entered
my
head
And
what
does
Zhitkov
say
to
it
I
asked
at
last
I
suppose
he
s
married
to
the
second
daughter
Married
repeated
Prokofy
and
this
time
he
grinned
all
over
his
face
They
won
t
let
him
into
the
house
We
don
t
want
you
they
say
get
along
home
with
you
It
s
as
I
said
Sletkin
directs
every
one
But
what
does
the
young
lady
say
Evlampia
Martinovna
Ah
master
I
could
tell
you
but
you
re
young
one
must
think
of
that
Things
are
going
on
here
that
are
oh
oh
oh
Hey
why
Dianka
s
setting
I
do
believe
My
dog
actually
had
stopped
short
before
a
thick
oak
bush
which
bordered
a
narrow
ravine
by
the
roadside
Prokofy
and
I
ran
up
to
the
dog
a
snipe
flew
up
out
of
the
bush
we
both
fired
at
it
and
missed
the
snipe
settled
in
another
place
we
followed
it
The
soup
was
already
on
the
table
when
I
got
back
My
mother
scolded
me
What
s
the
meaning
of
it
she
said
with
displeasure
the
very
first
day
and
you
keep
us
waiting
for
dinner
I
brought
her
the
wild
snipe
I
had
killed
she
did
not
even
look
at
them
There
were
also
in
the
room
Souvenir
Kvitsinsky
and
Zhitkov
The
retired
major
was
huddled
in
a
corner
for
all
the
world
like
a
schoolboy
in
disgrace
His
face
wore
an
expression
of
mingled
confusion
and
annoyance
his
eyes
were
red
One
might
positively
have
imagined
he
had
recently
been
in
tears
My
mother
remained
in
an
ill
humour
I
was
at
no
great
pains
to
surmise
that
my
late
arrival
did
not
count
for
much
in
it
During
dinner-time
she
hardly
talked
at
all
The
major
turned
beseeching
glances
upon
her
from
time
to
time
but
ate
a
good
dinner
nevertheless
Souvenir
was
all
of
a
shake
Kvitsinsky
preserved
his
habitual
self-confidence
of
demeanour
Vikenty
Osipitch
my
mother
addressed
him
I
beg
you
to
send
a
carriage
to-morrow
for
Martin
Petrovitch
since
it
has
come
to
my
knowledge
that
he
has
none
of
his
own
And
bid
them
tell
him
to
come
without
fail
that
I
desire
to
see
him
Kvitsinsky
was
about
to
make
some
rejoinder
but
he
restrained
himself
And
let
Sletkin
know
continued
my
mother
that
I
command
him
to
present
himself
before
me
Do
you
hear
I
com
mand
Yes
just
so
that
scoundrel
ought
Zhitkov
was
beginning
in
a
subdued
voice
but
my
mother
gave
him
such
a
contemptuous
look
that
he
promptly
turned
away
and
was
silent
Do
you
hear
I
command
repeated
my
mother
Certainly
madam
Kvitsinsky
replied
submissively
but
with
dignity
Martin
Petrovitch
won
t
come
Souvenir
whispered
to
me
as
he
came
out
of
the
dining-room
with
me
after
dinner
You
should
just
see
what
s
happened
to
him
It
s
past
comprehension
It
s
come
to
this
that
whatever
they
say
to
him
he
doesn
t
understand
a
word
Yes
They
ve
got
the
snake
under
the
pitch-fork
And
Souvenir
went
off
into
his
revolting
laugh
Souvenir
s
prediction
turned
out
correct
Martin
Petrovitch
would
not
come
to
my
mother
She
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
this
and
despatched
a
letter
to
him
He
sent
her
a
square
bit
of
paper
on
which
the
following
words
were
written
in
big
letters
Indeed
I
can
t
I
should
die
of
shame
Let
me
go
to
my
ruin
Thanks
Don
t
torture
me
Martin
Harlov
Sletkin
did
come
but
not
on
the
day
on
which
my
mother
had
commanded
his
attendance
but
twenty-four
hours
later
My
mother
gave
orders
that
he
should
be
shown
into
her
boudoir
God
knows
what
their
interview
was
about
but
it
did
not
last
long
a
quarter
of
an
hour
not
more
Sletkin
came
out
of
my
mother
s
room
crimson
all
over
and
with
such
a
viciously
spiteful
and
insolent
expression
of
face
that
meeting
him
in
the
drawing-room
I
was
simply
petrified
while
Souvenir
who
was
hanging
about
there
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
snigger
My
mother
came
out
of
her
boudoir
also
very
red
in
the
face
and
announced
in
the
hearing
of
all
that
Mr
Sletkin
was
never
upon
any
pretext
to
be
admitted
to
her
presence
again
and
that
if
Martin
Petrovitch
s
daughters
were
to
make
bold
they
ve
impudence
enough
said
she
to
present
themselves
they
too
were
to
be
refused
admittance
At
dinner-time
she
suddenly
exclaimed
The
vile
little
Jew
I
picked
him
out
of
the
gutter
I
made
him
a
career
he
owes
everything
everything
to
me
and
he
dares
to
tell
me
I
ve
no
business
to
meddle
in
their
affairs
that
Martin
Petrovitch
is
full
of
whims
and
fancies
and
it
s
impossible
to
humour
him
Humour
him
indeed
What
a
thing
to
say
Ah
he
s
an
ungrateful
wretch
An
insolent
little
Jew
Major
Zhitkov
who
happened
to
be
one
of
the
company
at
dinner
imagined
that
now
it
was
no
less
than
the
will
of
the
Almighty
for
him
to
seize
the
opportunity
and
put
in
his
word
but
my
mother
promptly
settled
him
Well
and
you
re
a
fine
one
too
my
man
she
commented
Couldn
t
get
the
upper
hand
of
a
girl
and
he
an
officer
In
command
of
a
squadron
I
can
fancy
how
it
obeyed
you
He
take
a
steward
s
place
indeed
a
fine
steward
he
d
make
Kvitsinsky
who
was
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
table
smiled
to
himself
a
little
malignantly
while
poor
Zhitkov
could
do
nothing
but
twitch
his
moustaches
lift
his
eyebrows
and
bury
the
whole
of
his
hirsute
countenance
in
his
napkin
After
dinner
he
went
out
on
to
the
steps
to
smoke
his
pipe
as
usual
and
he
struck
me
as
so
miserable
and
forlorn
that
although
I
had
never
liked
him
I
joined
myself
on
to
him
at
once
How
was
it
Gavrila
Fedulitch
I
began
without
further
beating
about
the
bush
that
your
affair
with
Evlampia
Martinovna
was
broken
off
I
d
expected
you
to
be
married
long
ago
The
retired
major
looked
at
me
dejectedly
A
snake
in
the
grass
he
began
uttering
each
letter
of
each
syllable
with
bitter
distinctness
has
poisoned
me
with
his
fang
and
turned
all
my
hopes
in
life
to
ashes
And
I
could
tell
you
Dmitri
Semyonovitch
all
his
hellish
wiles
but
I
m
afraid
of
angering
your
mamma
You
re
young
yet
Prokofy
s
expression
flashed
across
my
mind
Even
as
it
is
Zhitkov
groaned
Patience
patience
nothing
else
is
left
me
He
struck
his
fist
upon
his
chest
Patience
old
soldier
patience
I
served
the
Tsar
faithfully
honourably
yes
I
spared
neither
blood
nor
sweat
and
now
see
what
I
am
brought
to
Had
it
been
in
the
regiment
and
the
matter
depending
upon
me
he
continued
after
a
short
silence
spent
in
convulsively
sucking
at
his
cherrywood
pipe
I
d
have
I
d
have
given
it
him
with
the
flat
side
of
my
sword
three
times
over
till
he
d
had
enough
Zhitkov
took
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
vacancy
as
though
admiring
the
picture
he
had
conjured
up
Souvenir
ran
up
and
began
quizzing
the
major
I
turned
away
from
them
and
determined
come
what
may
I
would
see
Martin
Petrovitch
with
my
own
eyes
My
boyish
curiosity
was
greatly
stirred
Next
day
I
set
out
with
my
gun
and
dog
but
without
Prokofy
to
the
Eskovo
copse
It
was
an
exquisite
day
I
fancy
there
are
no
days
like
that
in
September
anywhere
but
in
Russia
The
stillness
was
such
that
one
could
hear
a
hundred
paces
off
the
squirrel
hopping
over
the
dry
leaves
and
the
broken
twig
just
feebly
catching
at
the
other
branches
and
falling
at
last
on
the
soft
grass
to
lie
there
for
ever
not
to
stir
again
till
it
rotted
away
The
air
neither
warm
nor
chill
but
only
fragrant
and
as
it
were
keen
was
faintly
deliciously
stinging
in
my
eyes
and
on
my
cheeks
A
long
spider-web
delicate
as
a
silken
thread
with
a
white
ball
in
the
middle
floated
smoothly
in
the
air
and
sticking
to
the
butt-end
of
my
gun
stretched
straight
out
in
the
air
a
sign
of
settled
and
warm
weather
The
sun
shone
with
a
brightness
as
soft
as
moonlight
Wild
snipe
were
to
be
met
with
pretty
often
but
I
did
not
pay
special
attention
to
them
I
knew
that
the
copse
went
on
almost
to
Harlov
s
homestead
right
up
to
the
hedge
of
his
garden
and
I
turned
my
steps
in
that
direction
though
I
could
not
even
imagine
how
I
should
get
into
the
place
itself
and
was
even
doubtful
whether
I
ought
to
try
to
do
so
as
my
mother
was
so
angry
with
its
new
owners
Sounds
of
life
and
humanity
reached
me
from
no
great
distance
I
listened
Some
one
was
coming
through
the
copse
straight
towards
me
You
should
have
said
so
straight
out
dear
I
heard
a
woman
s
voice
Be
reasonable
another
voice
broke
in
the
voice
of
a
man
Can
one
do
it
all
at
once
I
knew
the
voices
There
was
the
gleam
of
a
woman
s
blue
gown
through
the
reddening
nut
bushes
Beside
it
stood
a
dark
full
coat
Another
instant
and
there
stepped
out
into
the
glade
five
paces
from
me
Sletkin
and
Evlampia
They
were
disconcerted
at
once
Evlampia
promptly
stepped
back
away
into
the
bushes
Sletkin
thought
a
little
and
came
up
to
me
There
was
not
a
trace
to
be
seen
in
his
face
of
the
obsequious
meekness
with
which
he
had
paced
up
and
down
Harlov
s
courtyard
four
months
before
rubbing
up
my
horse
s
snaffle
But
neither
could
I
perceive
in
it
the
insolent
defiance
which
had
so
struck
me
on
the
previous
day
on
the
threshold
of
my
mother
s
boudoir
It
was
still
as
white
and
pretty
as
ever
but
seemed
broader
and
more
solid
Well
have
you
shot
many
snipe
he
asked
me
raising
his
cap
smiling
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
black
curls
you
are
shooting
in
our
copse
You
are
very
welcome
We
would
not
hinder
you
Quite
the
contrary
I
have
killed
nothing
to-day
I
rejoined
answering
his
first
question
and
I
will
go
out
of
your
copse
this
instant
Sletkin
hurriedly
put
on
his
cap
Indeed
why
so
We
would
not
drive
you
out
indeed
we
re
delighted
Here
s
Evlampia
Martinovna
will
say
the
same
Evlampia
Martinovna
come
here
Where
have
you
hidden
yourself
Evlampia
s
head
appeared
behind
the
bushes
But
she
did
not
come
up
to
us
She
had
grown
prettier
and
seemed
taller
and
bigger
than
ever
I
m
very
glad
to
tell
the
truth
Sletkin
went
on
that
I
have
met
you
Though
you
are
still
young
in
years
you
have
plenty
of
good
sense
already
Your
mother
was
pleased
to
be
very
angry
with
me
yesterday
she
would
not
listen
to
reason
of
any
sort
from
me
but
I
declare
as
before
God
so
before
you
now
I
am
not
to
blame
in
any
way
We
can
t
treat
Martin
Petrovitch
otherwise
than
we
do
he
s
fallen
into
complete
dotage
One
can
t
humour
all
his
whims
really
But
we
show
him
all
due
respect
Only
ask
Evlampia
Martinovna
Evlampia
did
not
stir
her
habitual
scornful
smile
flickered
about
her
lips
and
her
large
eyes
watched
us
with
no
friendly
expression
But
why
Vladimir
Vassilievitch
have
you
sold
Martin
Petrovitch
s
mare
I
was
particularly
impressed
by
that
mare
being
in
the
possession
of
a
peasant
His
mare
why
did
we
sell
it
Why
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
what
use
was
she
She
was
simply
eating
her
head
off
But
with
the
peasant
she
can
work
at
the
plough
anyway
As
for
Martin
Petrovitch
if
he
takes
a
fancy
to
drive
out
anywhere
he
s
only
to
ask
us
We
wouldn
t
refuse
him
a
conveyance
On
a
holiday
we
should
be
pleased
Vladimir
Vassilievitch
said
Evlampia
huskily
as
though
calling
him
away
and
she
still
did
not
stir
from
her
place
She
was
twisting
some
stalks
of
ripple
grass
round
her
fingers
and
snapping
off
their
heads
slapping
them
against
each
other
About
the
page
Maximka
again
Sletkin
went
on
Martin
Petrovitch
complains
because
we
ve
taken
him
away
and
apprenticed
him
But
kindly
consider
the
matter
for
yourself
Why
what
had
he
to
do
waiting
on
Martin
Petrovitch
Kick
up
his
heels
nothing
more
And
he
couldn
t
even
wait
on
him
properly
on
account
of
his
stupidity
and
his
youth
Now
we
have
sent
him
away
to
a
harness-maker
s
He
ll
be
turned
into
a
first-rate
handicraftsman
and
make
a
good
thing
of
it
for
himself
and
pay
us
ransom-money
too
And
living
in
a
small
way
as
we
do
that
s
a
matter
of
importance
On
a
little
farm
like
ours
one
can
t
afford
to
let
anything
slip
And
this
is
the
man
Martin
Petrovitch
called
a
poor
stick
I
thought
But
who
reads
to
Martin
Petrovitch
now
I
asked
Why
what
is
there
to
read
He
had
one
book
but
luckily
that
s
been
mislaid
somewhere
And
what
use
is
reading
at
his
age
And
who
shaves
him
I
asked
again
Sletkin
gave
an
approving
laugh
as
though
in
response
to
an
amusing
joke
Why
nobody
At
first
he
used
to
singe
his
beard
in
the
candle
but
now
he
lets
it
be
altogether
And
it
s
lovely
Vladimir
Vassilievitch
Evlampia
repeated
insistently
Vladimir
Vassilievitch
Sletkin
made
her
a
sign
with
his
hand
Martin
Petrovitch
is
clothed
and
cared
for
and
eats
what
we
do
What
more
does
he
want
He
declared
himself
that
he
wanted
nothing
more
in
this
world
but
to
think
of
his
soul
If
only
he
would
realise
that
everything
now
however
you
look
at
it
is
ours
He
says
too
that
we
don
t
pay
him
his
allowance
But
we
ve
not
always
got
money
ourselves
and
what
does
he
want
with
it
when
he
has
everything
provided
him
And
we
treat
him
as
one
of
the
family
too
I
m
telling
you
the
truth
The
rooms
for
instance
which
he
occupies
how
we
need
them
there
s
simply
not
room
to
turn
round
without
them
but
we
don
t
say
a
word
we
put
up
with
it
We
even
think
how
to
provide
amusement
for
him
There
on
St
Peter
s
Day
I
bought
him
some
excellent
hooks
in
the
town
real
English
ones
expensive
hooks
to
catch
fish
There
are
lots
of
carp
in
our
pond
Let
him
sit
and
fish
in
an
hour
or
two
there
d
be
a
nice
little
fish
soup
provided
The
most
suitable
occupation
for
old
men
Vladimir
Vassilitch
Evlampia
called
for
the
third
time
in
an
incisive
tone
and
she
flung
far
away
from
her
the
grass
she
had
been
twisting
in
her
fingers
I
am
going
Her
eyes
met
mine
I
am
going
Vladimir
Vassilievitch
she
repeated
and
vanished
behind
a
bush
I
m
coming
Evlampia
Martinovna
directly
shouted
Sletkin
Martin
Petrovitch
himself
agrees
with
us
now
he
went
on
turning
again
to
me
At
first
he
was
offended
certainly
and
even
grumbled
until
you
know
he
realised
he
was
you
remember
a
hot-tempered
violent
man
more
s
the
pity
but
there
he
s
grown
quite
meek
now
Because
he
sees
his
own
interest
Your
mamma
mercy
on
us
how
she
pitched
into
me
To
be
sure
she
s
a
lady
that
sets
as
much
store
by
her
own
authority
as
Martin
Petrovitch
used
to
do
But
you
come
in
and
see
for
yourself
And
you
might
put
in
a
word
when
there
s
an
opportunity
I
feel
Natalia
Nikolaevna
s
bounty
to
me
deeply
But
we
ve
got
to
live
too
And
how
was
it
Zhitkov
was
refused
I
asked
Fedulitch
That
dolt
Sletkin
shrugged
his
shoulders
Why
upon
my
word
what
use
could
he
have
been
His
whole
life
spent
among
soldiers
and
now
he
has
a
fancy
to
take
up
farming
He
can
keep
the
peasants
up
to
the
mark
says
he
because
he
s
been
used
to
knocking
men
about
He
can
do
nothing
even
knocking
men
about
wants
some
sense
Evlampia
Martinovna
refused
him
herself
He
was
a
quite
unsuitable
person
All
our
farming
would
have
gone
to
ruin
with
him
Coo
y
sounded
Evlampia
s
musical
voice
Coming
coming
Sletkin
called
back
He
held
out
his
hand
to
me
Though
unwillingly
I
took
it
I
beg
to
take
leave
Dmitri
Semyonovitch
said
Sletkin
showing
all
his
white
teeth
Shoot
wild
snipe
as
much
as
you
like
It
s
wild
game
belonging
to
no
one
But
if
you
come
across
a
hare
you
spare
it
that
game
is
ours
Oh
and
something
else
won
t
you
be
having
pups
from
your
bitch
I
should
be
obliged
for
one
Coo
y
Evlampia
s
voice
rang
out
again
Coo
y
Sletkin
responded
and
rushed
into
the
bushes
I
remember
when
I
was
left
alone
I
was
absorbed
in
wondering
how
it
was
Harlov
had
not
pounded
Sletkin
into
a
jelly
as
he
said
and
how
it
was
Sletkin
had
not
been
afraid
of
such
a
fate
It
was
clear
Martin
Petrovitch
really
had
grown
meek
I
thought
and
I
had
a
still
stronger
desire
to
make
my
way
into
Eskovo
and
get
at
least
a
glance
at
that
colossus
whom
I
could
never
picture
to
myself
subdued
and
tractable
I
had
reached
the
edge
of
the
copse
when
suddenly
a
big
snipe
with
a
great
rush
of
wings
darted
up
at
my
very
feet
and
flew
off
into
the
depths
of
the
wood
I
took
aim
my
gun
missed
fire
I
was
greatly
annoyed
it
had
been
such
a
fine
bird
and
I
made
up
my
mind
to
try
if
I
couldn
t
make
it
rise
a
second
time
I
set
off
in
the
direction
of
its
flight
and
going
some
two
hundred
paces
off
into
the
wood
I
caught
sight
in
a
little
glade
under
an
overhanging
birch-tree
not
of
the
snipe
but
of
the
same
Sletkin
once
more
He
was
lying
on
his
back
with
both
hands
under
his
head
and
with
smile
of
contentment
gazing
upwards
at
the
sky
swinging
his
left
leg
which
was
crossed
over
his
right
knee
He
did
not
notice
my
approach
A
few
paces
from
him
Evlampia
was
walking
slowly
up
and
down
the
little
glade
with
downcast
eyes
It
seemed
as
though
she
were
looking
for
something
in
the
grass
mushrooms
or
something
now
and
then
she
stooped
and
stretched
out
her
hand
She
was
singing
in
a
low
voice
I
stopped
at
once
and
fell
to
listening
At
first
I
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
she
was
singing
but
afterwards
I
recognised
clearly
the
following
well-known
lines
of
the
old
ballad
Hither
hither
threatening
storm-cloud
Slay
for
me
the
father-in-law
Strike
for
me
the
mother-in-law
The
young
wife
I
will
kill
myself
Evlampia
sang
louder
and
louder
the
last
words
she
delivered
with
peculiar
energy
Sletkin
still
lay
on
his
back
and
laughed
to
himself
while
she
seemed
all
the
time
to
be
moving
round
and
round
him
Oh
indeed
he
commented
at
last
The
things
that
come
into
some
people
s
heads
What
queried
Evlampia
Sletkin
raised
his
head
a
little
What
Why
what
words
were
those
you
were
uttering
Why
you
know
Volodya
one
can
t
leave
the
words
out
of
a
song
answered
Evlampia
and
she
turned
and
saw
me
We
both
cried
out
aloud
at
once
and
both
rushed
away
in
opposite
directions
I
made
my
way
hurriedly
out
of
the
copse
and
crossing
a
narrow
clearing
found
myself
facing
Harlov
s
garden
I
had
no
time
nor
would
it
have
been
of
any
use
to
deliberate
over
what
I
had
seen
Only
an
expression
kept
recurring
to
my
mind
love
spell
which
I
had
lately
heard
and
over
the
signification
of
which
I
had
pondered
a
good
deal
I
walked
alongside
the
garden
fence
and
in
a
few
moments
behind
the
silver
poplars
they
had
not
yet
lost
a
single
leaf
and
the
foliage
was
luxuriantly
thick
and
brilliantly
glistening
I
saw
the
yard
and
two
little
lodges
of
Martin
Petrovitch
s
homestead
The
whole
place
struck
me
as
having
been
tidied
up
and
pulled
into
shape
On
every
side
one
could
perceive
traces
of
unflagging
and
severe
supervision
Anna
Martinovna
came
out
on
to
the
steps
and
screwing
up
her
blue-grey
eyes
gazed
for
a
long
while
in
the
direction
of
the
copse
Have
you
seen
the
master
she
asked
a
peasant
who
was
walking
across
the
yard
Vladimir
Vassilitch
responded
the
latter
taking
his
cap
off
He
went
into
the
copse
surely
I
know
he
went
to
the
copse
Hasn
t
he
come
back
Haven
t
you
seen
him
I
ve
not
seen
him
nay
The
peasant
continued
standing
bareheaded
before
Anna
Martinovna
Well
you
can
go
she
said
Or
no
wait
a
bit
where
s
Martin
Petrovitch
Do
you
know
Oh
Martin
Petrovitch
answered
the
peasant
in
a
sing-song
voice
alternately
lifting
his
right
and
then
his
left
hand
as
though
pointing
away
somewhere
is
sitting
yonder
at
the
pond
with
a
fishing-rod
He
s
sitting
in
the
reeds
with
a
rod
Catching
fish
maybe
God
knows
Very
well
you
can
go
repeated
Anna
Martinovna
and
put
away
that
wheel
it
s
lying
about
The
peasant
ran
to
carry
out
her
command
while
she
remained
standing
a
few
minutes
longer
on
the
steps
still
gazing
in
the
direction
of
the
copse
Then
she
clenched
one
fist
menacingly
and
went
slowly
back
into
the
house
Axiutka
I
heard
her
imperious
voice
calling
within
Anna
Martinovna
looked
angry
and
tightened
her
lips
thin
enough
at
all
times
with
a
sort
of
special
energy
She
was
carelessly
dressed
and
a
coil
of
loose
hair
had
fallen
down
on
to
her
shoulder
But
in
spite
of
the
negligence
of
her
attire
and
her
irritable
humour
she
struck
me
just
as
before
as
attractive
and
I
should
have
been
delighted
to
kiss
the
narrow
hand
which
looked
malignant
too
as
she
twice
irritably
pushed
back
the
loose
tress
Can
Martin
Petrovitch
have
really
taken
to
fishing
I
asked
myself
as
I
turned
towards
the
pond
which
was
on
one
side
of
the
garden
I
got
on
to
the
dam
looked
in
all
directions
Martin
Petrovitch
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
I
bent
my
steps
along
one
of
the
banks
of
the
pond
and
at
last
at
the
very
top
of
it
in
a
little
creek
in
the
midst
of
flat
broken-down
stalks
of
reddish
reed
I
caught
sight
of
a
huge
greyish
mass
I
looked
intently
it
was
Harlov
Bareheaded
unkempt
in
a
cotton
smock
torn
at
the
seams
with
his
legs
crossed
under
him
he
was
sitting
motionless
on
the
bare
earth
So
motionless
was
he
that
a
sandpiper
at
my
approach
darted
up
from
the
dry
mud
a
couple
of
paces
from
him
and
flew
with
a
flash
of
its
little
wings
and
a
whistle
over
the
surface
of
the
water
showing
that
no
one
had
moved
to
frighten
him
for
a
long
while
Harlov
s
whole
appearance
was
so
extraordinary
that
my
dog
stopped
short
directly
it
saw
him
lifted
its
tail
and
growled
He
turned
his
head
a
very
little
and
fixed
his
wild-looking
eyes
on
me
and
my
dog
He
was
greatly
changed
by
his
beard
though
it
was
short
but
thick
and
curly
in
white
tufts
like
Astrachan
fur
In
his
right
hand
lay
the
end
of
a
rod
while
the
other
end
hovered
feebly
over
the
water
I
felt
an
involuntary
pang
at
my
heart
I
plucked
up
my
spirits
however
went
up
to
him
and
wished
him
good
morning
He
slowly
blinked
as
though
just
awake
What
are
you
doing
Martin
Petrovitch
I
began
catching
fish
here
Yes
fish
he
answered
huskily
and
pulled
up
the
rod
on
which
there
fluttered
a
piece
of
line
a
fathom
length
with
no
hook
on
it
Your
tackle
