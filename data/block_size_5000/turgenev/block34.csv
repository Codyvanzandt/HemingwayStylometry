a
hunting
expedition
and
betook
myself
to
Alexandr
Mihalitch
's
The
dinner
was
fixed
for
six
o'clock
I
arrived
at
five
and
found
already
a
great
number
of
gentlemen
in
uniforms
in
civilian
dress
and
other
nondescript
garments
My
host
met
me
cordially
but
soon
hurried
away
to
the
butler
's
pantry
He
was
expecting
a
great
dignitary
and
was
in
a
state
of
agitation
not
quite
in
keeping
with
his
independent
position
in
society
and
his
wealth
Alexandr
Mihalitch
had
never
married
and
did
not
care
for
women
his
house
was
the
centre
of
a
bachelor
society
He
lived
in
grand
style
he
had
enlarged
and
sumptuously
redecorated
his
ancestral
mansion
spent
fifteen
thousand
roubles
on
wine
from
Moscow
every
year
and
enjoyed
the
highest
public
consideration
Alexandr
Mihalitch
had
retired
from
the
service
ages
ago
and
had
no
ambition
to
gain
official
honours
of
any
kind
What
could
have
induced
him
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
procure
a
guest
of
high
official
position
and
to
be
in
a
state
of
excitement
from
early
morning
on
the
day
of
the
grand
dinner
That
remains
buried
in
the
obscurity
of
the
unknown
as
a
friend
of
mine
an
attorney
is
in
the
habit
of
saying
when
he
is
asked
whether
he
takes
bribes
when
kindly-disposed
persons
offer
them
On
parting
from
my
host
I
began
walking
through
the
rooms
Almost
all
the
guests
were
utterly
unknown
to
me
about
twenty
persons
were
already
seated
at
the
card-tables
Among
these
devotees
of
preference
were
two
warriors
with
aristocratic
but
rather
battered
countenances
a
few
civilian
officials
with
tight
high
cravats
and
drooping
dyed
moustaches
such
as
are
only
to
be
found
in
persons
of
resolute
character
and
strict
conservative
opinions
these
conservative
persons
picked
up
their
cards
with
dignity
and
without
turning
their
heads
glared
sideways
at
everyone
who
approached
and
five
or
six
local
petty
officials
with
fair
round
bellies
fat
moist
little
hands
and
staid
immovable
little
legs
These
worthies
spoke
in
a
subdued
voice
smiled
benignly
in
all
directions
held
their
cards
close
up
to
their
very
shirt-fronts
and
when
they
trumped
did
not
flap
their
cards
on
the
table
but
on
the
contrary
shed
them
with
an
undulatory
motion
on
the
green
cloth
and
packed
their
tricks
together
with
a
slight
unassuming
and
decorous
swish
The
rest
of
the
company
were
sitting
on
sofas
or
hanging
in
groups
about
the
doors
or
at
the
windows
one
gentleman
no
longer
young
though
of
feminine
appearance
stood
in
a
corner
fidgeting
blushing
and
twisting
the
seal
of
his
watch
over
his
stomach
in
his
embarrassment
though
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
him
some
others
in
swallow-tail
coats
and
checked
trousers
the
handiwork
of
the
tailor
and
Perpetual
Master
of
the
Tailors
Corporation
Firs
Klyuhin
were
talking
together
with
extraordinary
ease
and
liveliness
turning
their
bald
greasy
heads
from
side
to
side
unconstrainedly
as
they
talked
a
young
man
of
twenty
short-sighted
and
fair-haired
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
black
obviously
shy
smiled
sarcastically
I
was
beginning
however
to
feel
bored
when
suddenly
I
was
joined
by
a
young
man
one
Voinitsin
by
name
a
student
without
a
degree
who
resided
in
the
house
of
Alexandr
Mihalitch
in
the
capacity
of
it
would
be
hard
to
say
precisely
of
what
He
was
a
first-rate
shot
and
could
train
dogs
I
had
known
him
before
in
Moscow
He
was
one
of
those
young
men
who
at
every
examination
'played
at
dumb-show
that
is
to
say
did
not
answer
a
single
word
to
the
professor
's
questions
Such
persons
were
also
designated
'the
bearded
students
You
will
gather
that
this
was
in
long
past
days
This
was
how
it
used
to
be
they
would
call
Voinitsin
for
example
Voinitsin
who
had
sat
upright
and
motionless
in
his
place
bathed
in
a
hot
perspiration
from
head
to
foot
slowly
and
aimlessly
looked
about
him
got
up
hurriedly
buttoned
up
his
undergraduate
's
uniform
and
edged
up
to
the
examiner
's
table
'Take
a
paper
please
the
professor
would
say
to
him
pleasantly
Voinitsin
would
stretch
out
his
hand
and
with
trembling
fingers
fumble
at
the
pile
of
papers
'No
selecting
if
you
please
observed
in
a
jarring
voice
an
assistant-examiner
an
irritable
old
gentleman
a
professor
in
some
other
faculty
conceiving
a
sudden
hatred
for
the
unlucky
bearded
one
Voinitsin
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
took
a
paper
showed
the
number
on
it
and
went
and
sat
down
by
the
window
while
his
predecessor
was
answering
his
question
At
the
window
Voinitsin
never
took
his
eyes
off
his
paper
except
that
at
times
he
looked
slowly
round
as
before
though
he
did
not
move
a
muscle
But
his
predecessor
would
finish
at
last
and
would
be
dismissed
with
'Good
you
can
go
or
even
'Good
indeed
very
good
according
to
his
abilities
Then
they
call
Voinitsin
Voinitsin
gets
up
and
with
resolute
step
approaches
the
table
'Read
your
question
they
tell
him
Voinitsin
raises
the
paper
in
both
hands
up
to
his
very
nose
slowly
reads
it
and
slowly
drops
his
hands
'Well
now
your
answer
please
the
same
professor
remarks
languidly
throwing
himself
backwards
and
crossing
his
arms
over
his
breast
There
reigns
the
silence
of
the
tomb
'Why
are
you
silent
Voinitsin
is
mute
The
assistant-examiner
begins
to
be
restive
'Well
say
something
Voinitsin
is
as
still
as
if
he
were
dead
All
his
companions
gaze
inquisitively
at
the
back
of
his
thick
close-cropped
motionless
head
The
assistant-examiner
's
eyes
are
almost
starting
out
of
his
head
he
positively
hates
Voinitsin
'Well
this
is
strange
really
observes
the
other
examiner
'Why
do
you
stand
as
if
you
were
dumb
Come
don't
you
know
it
if
so
say
so
'Let
me
take
another
question
the
luckless
youth
articulates
thickly
The
professors
look
at
one
another
Well
take
one
the
head-examiner
answers
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
Voinitsin
again
takes
a
paper
again
goes
to
the
window
again
returns
to
the
table
and
again
is
silent
as
the
grave
The
assistant-examiner
is
capable
of
devouring
him
alive
At
last
they
send
him
away
and
mark
him
a
nought
You
would
think
'Now
at
least
he
will
go
Not
a
bit
of
it
He
goes
back
to
his
place
sits
just
as
immovably
to
the
end
of
the
examination
and
as
he
goes
out
exclaims
'I
've
been
on
the
rack
what
ill-luck
and
the
whole
of
that
day
he
wanders
about
Moscow
clutching
every
now
and
then
at
his
head
and
bitterly
cursing
his
luckless
fate
He
never
of
course
touched
a
book
and
the
next
day
the
same
story
was
repeated
So
this
was
the
Voinitsin
who
joined
me
We
talked
about
Moscow
about
sport
'Would
you
like
me
he
whispered
to
me
suddenly
'to
introduce
you
to
the
first
wit
of
these
parts
'If
you
will
be
so
kind
Voinitsin
led
me
up
to
a
little
man
with
a
high
tuft
of
hair
on
his
forehead
and
moustaches
in
a
cinnamon-coloured
frock-coat
and
striped
cravat
His
yellow
mobile
features
were
certainly
full
of
cleverness
and
sarcasm
His
lips
were
perpetually
curved
in
a
flitting
ironical
smile
little
black
eyes
screwed
up
with
an
impudent
expression
looked
out
from
under
uneven
lashes
Beside
him
stood
a
country
gentleman
broad
soft
and
sweet
a
veritable
sugar-and-honey
mixture
with
one
eye
He
laughed
in
anticipation
at
the
witticisms
of
the
little
man
and
seemed
positively
melting
with
delight
Voinitsin
presented
me
to
the
wit
whose
name
was
Piotr
Petrovitch
Lupihin
We
were
introduced
and
exchanged
the
preliminary
civilities
'Allow
me
to
present
to
you
my
best
friend
said
Lupihin
suddenly
in
a
strident
voice
seizing
the
sugary
gentleman
by
the
arm
'Come
do
n't
resist
Kirila
Selifanitch
he
added
'we
're
not
going
to
bite
you
I
commend
him
to
you
he
went
on
while
the
embarrassed
Kirila
Selifanitch
bowed
with
about
as
much
grace
as
if
he
were
undergoing
a
surgical
operation
'he
's
a
most
superior
gentleman
He
enjoyed
excellent
health
up
to
the
age
of
fifty
then
suddenly
conceived
the
idea
of
doctoring
his
eyes
in
consequence
of
which
he
has
lost
one
Since
then
he
doctors
his
peasants
with
similar
success
They
to
be
sure
repay
with
similar
devotion
'What
a
fellow
it
is
muttered
Kirila
Selifanitch
And
he
laughed
'Speak
out
my
friend
eh
speak
out
Lupihin
rejoined
'Why
they
may
elect
you
a
judge
I
should
n't
wonder
and
they
will
too
you
see
Well
to
be
sure
the
secretaries
will
do
the
thinking
for
you
we
may
assume
but
you
know
you
'll
have
to
be
able
to
speak
anyhow
even
if
only
to
express
the
ideas
of
others
Suppose
the
governor
comes
and
asks
Why
is
it
the
judge
stammers
And
they
'd
say
let
's
assume
It
's
a
paralytic
stroke
Then
bleed
him
he
'd
say
And
it
would
be
highly
indecorous
in
your
position
you
'll
admit
The
sugary
gentleman
was
positively
rolling
with
mirth
'You
see
he
laughs
Lupihin
pursued
with
a
malignant
glance
at
Kirila
Selifanitch
's
heaving
stomach
'And
why
should
n't
he
laugh
he
added
turning
to
me
'he
has
enough
to
eat
good
health
and
no
children
his
peasants
are
n't
mortgaged
to
be
sure
he
doctors
them
and
his
wife
is
cracked
Kirila
Selifanitch
turned
a
little
away
as
though
he
were
not
listening
but
he
still
continued
to
chuckle
'I
laugh
too
while
my
wife
has
eloped
with
a
land-surveyor
He
grinned
'Did
n't
you
know
that
What
Why
one
fine
day
she
ran
away
with
him
and
left
me
a
letter
Dear
Piotr
Petrovitch
she
said
forgive
me
carried
away
by
passion
I
am
leaving
with
the
friend
of
my
heart
And
the
land-surveyor
only
took
her
fancy
through
not
cutting
his
nails
and
wearing
tight
trousers
You
're
surprised
at
that
Why
this
she
said
is
a
man
with
no
dissimulation
about
him
But
mercy
on
us
Rustic
fellows
like
us
speak
the
truth
too
plainly
But
let
us
move
away
a
bit
It
's
not
for
us
to
stand
beside
a
future
judge
He
took
me
by
the
arm
and
we
moved
away
to
a
window
'I
've
the
reputation
of
a
wit
here
he
said
to
me
in
the
course
of
conversation
'You
need
not
believe
that
I
'm
simply
an
embittered
man
and
I
do
my
railing
aloud
that
's
how
it
is
I
'm
so
free
and
easy
in
my
speech
And
why
should
I
mince
matters
if
you
come
to
that
I
don't
care
a
straw
for
anyone
's
opinion
and
I
've
nothing
to
gain
I'm
spiteful
what
of
that
A
spiteful
man
at
least
needs
no
wit
And
however
enlightening
it
may
be
you
wo
n't
believe
it
I
say
now
I
say
look
at
our
host
There
what
is
he
running
to
and
fro
like
that
for
Upon
my
word
he
keeps
looking
at
his
watch
smiling
perspiring
putting
on
a
solemn
face
keeping
us
all
starving
for
our
dinner
Such
a
prodigy
a
real
court
grandee
Look
look
he
's
running
again
bounding
positively
look
And
Lupihin
laughed
shrilly
'The
only
pity
is
there
are
no
ladies
he
resumed
with
a
deep
sigh
'it
's
a
bachelor
party
else
that
's
when
your
humble
servant
gets
on
Look
look
he
cried
suddenly
'Prince
Kozelsky
's
come
that
tall
man
there
with
a
beard
in
yellow
gloves
You
can
see
at
once
he
's
been
abroad
and
he
always
arrives
as
late
He
's
as
heavy
I
tell
you
by
himself
as
a
pair
of
merchant
's
horses
and
you
should
see
how
condescendingly
he
talks
with
your
humble
servant
how
graciously
he
deigns
to
smile
at
the
civilities
of
our
starving
mothers
and
daughters
And
he
sometimes
sets
up
for
a
wit
but
he
is
only
here
for
a
little
time
and
oh
his
witticisms
It
's
for
all
the
world
like
hacking
at
a
ship
's
cable
with
a
blunt
knife
He
ca
n't
bear
me
I'm
going
to
bow
to
him
And
Lupihin
ran
off
to
meet
the
prince
'And
here
comes
my
special
enemy
he
observed
turning
all
at
once
to
me
'Do
you
see
that
fat
man
with
the
brown
face
and
the
bristles
on
his
head
over
there
that
's
got
his
cap
clutched
in
his
hand
and
is
creeping
along
by
the
wall
and
glaring
in
all
directions
like
a
wolf
I
sold
him
for
400
roubles
a
horse
worth
1000
and
that
stupid
animal
has
a
perfect
right
now
to
despise
me
though
all
the
while
he
is
so
destitute
of
all
faculty
of
imagination
especially
in
the
morning
before
his
tea
or
after
dinner
that
if
you
say
Good
morning
to
him
he
'll
answer
Is
it
'And
here
comes
the
general
pursued
Lupihin
'the
civilian
general
a
retired
destitute
general
He
has
a
daughter
of
beetroot-sugar
and
a
manufactory
with
scrofula
Beg
pardon
I've
got
it
wrong
but
there
you
understand
Ah
and
the
architect's
turned
up
here
A
German
and
wears
moustaches
and
does
not
understand
his
business
a
natural
phenomenon
though
what
need
for
him
to
understand
his
business
so
long
as
he
takes
bribes
and
sticks
in
pillars
everywhere
to
suit
the
tastes
of
our
pillars
of
society
Lupihin
chuckled
again
But
suddenly
a
wave
of
excitement
passed
over
the
whole
house
The
grandee
had
arrived
The
host
positively
rushed
into
the
hall
After
him
ran
a
few
devoted
members
of
the
household
and
eager
guests
The
noisy
talk
was
transformed
into
a
subdued
pleasant
chat
like
the
buzzing
of
bees
in
spring
within
their
hives
Only
the
turbulent
wasp
Lupihin
and
the
splendid
drone
Kozelsky
did
not
subdue
their
voices
And
behold
at
last
the
queen
the
great
dignitary
entered
Hearts
bounded
to
meet
him
sitting
bodies
rose
even
the
gentleman
who
had
bought
a
horse
from
Lupihin
poked
his
chin
into
his
chest
The
great
personage
kept
up
his
dignity
in
an
inimitable
manner
throwing
his
head
back
as
though
he
were
bowing
he
uttered
a
few
words
of
approbation
of
which
each
was
prefaced
by
the
syllable
er
drawled
through
his
nose
with
a
sort
of
devouring
indignation
he
looked
at
Prince
Kozelsky
's
democratic
beard
and
gave
the
destitute
general
with
the
factory
and
the
daughter
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
After
a
few
minutes
in
the
course
of
which
the
dignitary
had
had
time
to
observe
twice
that
he
was
very
glad
he
was
not
late
for
dinner
the
whole
company
trooped
into
the
dining-room
the
swells
first
There
is
no
need
to
describe
to
the
reader
how
they
put
the
great
man
in
the
most
important
place
between
the
civilian
general
and
the
marshal
of
the
province
a
man
of
an
independent
and
dignified
expression
of
face
in
perfect
keeping
with
his
starched
shirt-front
his
expanse
of
waistcoat
and
his
round
snuff-box
full
of
French
snuff
how
our
host
bustled
about
and
ran
up
and
down
fussing
and
pressing
the
guests
to
eat
smiling
at
the
great
man
's
back
in
passing
and
hurriedly
snatching
a
plate
of
soup
or
a
bit
of
bread
in
a
corner
like
a
schoolboy
how
the
butler
brought
in
a
fish
more
than
a
yard
long
with
a
nosegay
in
its
mouth
how
the
surly-looking
foot-men
in
livery
sullenly
plied
every
gentleman
now
with
Malaga
now
dry
Madeira
and
how
almost
all
the
gentlemen
particularly
the
more
elderly
ones
drank
off
glass
after
glass
with
an
air
of
reluctantly
resigning
themselves
to
a
sense
of
duty
and
finally
how
they
began
popping
champagne
bottles
and
proposing
toasts
all
that
is
probably
only
too
well
known
to
the
reader
But
what
struck
me
as
especially
noteworthy
was
the
anecdote
told
us
by
the
great
man
himself
amid
a
general
delighted
silence
Someone
I
fancy
it
was
the
destitute
general
a
man
familiar
with
modern
literature
referred
to
the
influence
of
women
in
general
and
especially
on
young
men
'Yes
yes
chimed
in
the
great
man
'that's
true
but
young
men
ought
to
be
kept
in
strict
subjection
or
else
very
likely
they
'll
go
out
of
their
senses
over
every
petticoat
A
smile
of
child-like
delight
flitted
over
the
faces
of
all
the
guests
positive
gratitude
could
be
seen
in
one
gentleman
's
eyes
'For
young
men
are
idiots
The
great
man
I
suppose
for
the
sake
of
greater
impressiveness
sometimes
changed
the
accepted
accentuation
of
words
'My
son
Ivan
for
instance
he
went
on
'the
fool
's
only
just
twenty
and
all
at
once
he
comes
to
me
and
says
Let
me
be
married
father
I
told
him
he
was
a
fool
told
him
he
must
go
into
the
service
first
Well
there
was
despair
tears
but
with
me
no
nonsense
The
words
'no
nonsense
the
great
man
seemed
to
enunciate
more
with
his
stomach
than
his
lips
he
paused
and
glanced
majestically
at
his
neighbour
the
general
while
he
raised
his
eyebrows
higher
than
any
one
could
have
expected
The
civilian
general
nodded
agreeably
a
little
on
one
side
and
with
extraordinary
rapidity
winked
with
the
eye
turned
to
the
great
man
'And
what
do
you
think
the
great
man
began
again
'now
he
writes
to
me
himself
and
thanks
me
for
looking
after
him
when
he
was
a
fool
So
that
's
the
way
to
act
All
the
guests
of
course
were
in
complete
agreement
with
the
speaker
and
seemed
quite
cheered
up
by
the
pleasure
and
instruction
they
derived
from
him
After
dinner
the
whole
party
rose
and
moved
into
the
drawing-room
with
a
great
deal
of
noise
decorous
however
and
as
it
were
licensed
for
the
occasion
They
sat
down
to
cards
I
got
through
the
evening
somehow
and
charging
my
coachman
to
have
my
carriage
ready
at
five
o'clock
next
morning
I
went
to
my
room
But
I
was
destined
in
the
course
of
that
same
day
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
remarkable
man
In
consequence
of
the
great
number
of
guests
staying
in
the
house
no
one
had
a
bedroom
to
himself
In
the
small
greenish
damp
room
to
which
I
was
conducted
by
Alexandr
Mihalitch
's
butler
there
was
already
another
guest
quite
undressed
On
seeing
me
he
quickly
ducked
under
the
bed-clothes
covered
himself
up
to
the
nose
turned
a
little
on
the
soft
feather-bed
and
lay
quiet
keeping
a
sharp
look-out
from
under
the
round
frill
of
his
cotton
night-cap
I
went
up
to
the
other
bed
there
were
only
two
in
the
room
undressed
and
lay
down
in
the
damp
sheets
My
neighbour
turned
over
in
bed
I
wished
him
good-night
Half-an-hour
went
by
In
spite
of
all
my
efforts
I
could
not
get
to
sleep
aimless
and
vague
thoughts
kept
persistently
and
monotonously
dragging
one
after
another
on
an
endless
chain
like
the
buckets
of
a
hydraulic
machine
'You
're
not
asleep
I
fancy
observed
my
neighbour
'No
as
you
see
I
answered
'And
you
're
not
sleepy
either
are
you
'I
'm
never
sleepy
'How
's
that
'Oh
I
go
to
sleep
I
do
n't
know
what
for
I
lie
in
bed
and
lie
in
bed
and
so
get
to
sleep
'Why
do
you
go
to
bed
before
you
feel
sleepy
'Why
what
would
you
have
me
do
I
made
no
answer
to
my
neighbour
's
question
'I
wonder
he
went
on
after
a
brief
silence
'how
it
is
there
are
no
fleas
here
Where
should
there
be
fleas
if
not
here
one
wonders
'You
seem
to
regret
them
I
remarked
'No
I
do
n't
regret
them
but
I
like
everything
to
be
consecutive
'O-ho
thought
I
'what
words
he
uses
My
neighbour
was
silent
again
'Would
you
like
to
make
a
bet
with
me
he
said
again
rather
loudly
'What
about
I
began
to
be
amused
by
him
'Hm
what
about
Why
about
this
I
'm
certain
you
take
me
for
a
fool
'Really
I
muttered
astounded
'For
an
ignoramus
for
a
rustic
of
the
steppes
Confess
'I
have
n't
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
I
responded
'What
can
make
you
infer
'Why
the
sound
of
your
voice
is
enough
you
answer
me
so
carelessly
But
I
'm
not
at
all
what
you
suppose
'Allow
me
'No
you
allow
me
In
the
first
place
I
speak
French
as
well
as
you
and
German
even
better
secondly
I
have
spent
three
years
abroad
in
Berlin
alone
I
lived
eight
months
I
've
studied
Hegel
honoured
sir
I
know
Goethe
by
heart
add
to
that
I
was
a
long
while
in
love
with
a
German
professor
's
daughter
and
was
married
at
home
to
a
consumptive
lady
who
was
bald
but
a
remarkable
personality
So
I
'm
a
bird
of
your
feather
I
'm
not
a
barbarian
of
the
steppes
as
you
imagine
I
too
have
been
bitten
by
reflection
and
there
's
nothing
obvious
about
me
I
raised
my
head
and
looked
with
redoubled
attention
at
the
queer
fellow
By
the
dim
light
of
the
night-lamp
I
could
hardly
distinguish
his
features
'There
you
're
looking
at
me
now
he
went
on
setting
his
night-cap
straight
'and
probably
you
're
asking
yourself
How
is
it
I
didn't
notice
him
to-day
I
'll
tell
you
why
you
did
n't
notice
me
because
I
did
n't
raise
my
voice
because
I
get
behind
other
people
hang
about
doorways
and
talk
to
no
one
because
when
the
butler
passes
me
with
a
tray
he
raises
his
elbow
to
the
level
of
my
shoulder
And
how
is
it
all
that
comes
about
From
two
causes
first
I
'm
poor
and
secondly
I
've
grown
humble
Tell
the
truth
you
did
n't
notice
me
did
you
'Certainly
I
've
not
had
the
pleasure
'There
there
he
interrupted
me
'I
knew
that
He
raised
himself
and
folded
his
arms
the
long
shadow
of
his
cap
was
bent
from
the
wall
to
the
ceiling
'And
confess
now
he
added
with
a
sudden
sideway
glance
at
me
'I
must
strike
you
as
a
queer
fellow
an
original
as
they
say
or
possibly
as
something
worse
perhaps
you
think
I
affect
to
be
original
'I
must
repeat
again
that
I
do
n't
know
you
He
looked
down
an
instant
'Why
have
I
begun
talking
so
unexpectedly
to
you
a
man
utterly
a
stranger
the
Lord
the
Lord
only
knows
He
sighed
'Not
through
the
natural
affinity
of
our
souls
Both
you
and
I
are
respectable
people
that
's
to
say
egoists
neither
of
us
has
the
least
concern
with
the
other
is
n't
it
so
But
we
are
neither
of
us
sleepy
so
why
not
chat
I
'm
in
the
mood
and
that
's
rare
with
me
I
'm
shy
do
you
see
and
not
shy
because
I
'm
a
provincial
of
no
rank
and
poor
but
because
I
'm
a
fearfully
vain
person
But
at
times
under
favourable
circumstances
occasions
which
I
could
not
however
particularise
nor
foresee
my
shyness
vanishes
completely
as
at
this
moment
for
instance
At
this
moment
you
might
set
me
face
to
face
with
the
Grand
Lama
and
I
'd
ask
him
for
a
pinch
of
snuff
But
perhaps
you
want
to
go
to
sleep
'Quite
the
contrary
I
hastened
to
respond
'it
is
a
pleasure
for
me
to
talk
to
you
'That
is
I
amuse
you
you
mean
to
say
All
the
better
And
so
I
tell
you
they
call
me
here
an
original
that
's
what
they
call
me
when
my
name
is
casually
mentioned
among
other
gossip
No
one
is
much
concerned
about
my
fate
They
think
it
wounds
me
Oh
good
Lord
if
they
only
knew
it
's
just
what
's
my
ruin
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
original
in
me
nothing
except
such
freaks
as
for
instance
my
conversation
at
this
moment
with
you
but
such
freaks
are
not
worth
a
brass
farthing
That
's
the
cheapest
and
lowest
sort
of
originality
He
turned
facing
me
and
waved
his
hands
'Honoured
sir
he
cried
'I
am
of
the
opinion
that
life
on
earth
's
only
worth
living
as
a
rule
for
original
people
it
's
only
they
who
have
a
right
to
live
Man
verre
n'est
pas
grand
maisje
bois
dans
mon
verre
said
someone
Do
you
see
he
added
in
an
undertone
'how
well
I
pronounce
French
What
is
it
to
one
if
one
's
a
capacious
brain
and
understands
everything
and
knows
a
lot
and
keeps
pace
with
the
age
if
one
's
nothing
of
one
's
own
of
oneself
One
more
storehouse
for
hackneyed
commonplaces
in
the
world
and
what
good
does
that
do
to
anyone
No
better
be
stupid
even
but
in
one
's
own
way
One
should
have
a
flavour
of
one
's
own
one
's
individual
flavour
that
's
the
thing
And
do
n't
suppose
that
I
am
very
exacting
as
to
that
flavour
God
forbid
There
are
no
end
of
original
people
of
the
sort
I
mean
look
where
you
will
there
's
an
original
every
live
man
is
an
original
but
I
am
not
to
be
reckoned
among
them
'And
yet
he
went
on
after
a
brief
silence
'in
my
youth
what
expectations
I
aroused
What
a
high
opinion
I
cherished
of
my
own
individuality
before
I
went
abroad
and
even
at
first
after
my
return
Well
abroad
I
kept
my
ears
open
held
aloof
from
everyone
as
befits
a
man
like
me
who
is
always
seeing
through
things
by
himself
and
at
the
end
has
not
understood
the
A
B
C
'An
original
an
original
he
hurried
on
shaking
his
head
reproachfully
They
call
me
an
original
In
reality
it
turns
out
that
there
's
not
a
man
in
the
world
less
original
than
your
humble
servant
I
must
have
been
born
even
in
imitation
of
someone
else
Oh
dear
It
seems
I
am
living
too
in
imitation
of
the
various
authors
studied
by
me
in
the
sweat
of
my
brow
I
live
and
I
've
studied
and
fallen
in
love
and
married
in
fact
as
it
were
not
through
my
own
will
as
it
were
fulfilling
some
sort
of
duty
or
sort
of
fate
who's
to
make
it
out
He
tore
the
nightcap
off
his
head
and
flung
it
on
the
bed
'Would
you
like
me
to
tell
you
the
story
of
my
life
he
asked
me
in
an
abrupt
voice
'or
rather
a
few
incidents
of
my
life
'Please
do
me
the
favour
'Or
no
I
'd
better
tell
you
how
I
got
married
You
see
marriage
is
an
important
thing
the
touchstone
that
tests
the
whole
man
in
it
as
in
a
glass
is
reflected
But
that
sounds
too
hackneyed
If
you'll
allow
me
I
'll
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
He
pulled
a
snuff-box
from
under
his
pillow
opened
it
and
began
again
waving
the
open
snuff-box
about
'Put
yourself
honoured
sir
in
my
place
Judge
for
yourself
what
now
what
tell
me
as
a
favour
what
benefit
could
I
derive
from
the
encyclopaedia
of
Hegel
What
is
there
in
common
tell
me
between
that
encyclopaedia
and
Russian
life
and
how
would
you
advise
me
to
apply
it
to
our
life
and
not
it
the
encyclopaedia
only
but
German
philosophy
in
general
I
will
say
more
science
itself
He
gave
a
bound
on
the
bed
and
muttered
to
himself
gnashing
his
teeth
angrily
'Ah
that
's
it
that
's
it
Then
why
did
you
go
trailing
off
abroad
Why
did
n't
you
stay
at
home
and
study
the
life
surrounding
you
on
the
spot
You
might
have
found
out
its
needs
and
its
future
and
have
come
to
a
clear
comprehension
of
your
vocation
so
to
say
But
upon
my
word
he
went
on
changing
his
tone
again
as
though
timidly
justifying
himself
'where
is
one
to
study
what
no
sage
has
yet
inscribed
in
any
book
I
should
have
been
glad
indeed
to
take
lessons
of
her
of
Russian
life
I
mean
but
she
's
dumb
the
poor
dear
You
must
take
her
as
she
is
but
that
's
beyond
my
power
you
must
give
me
the
inference
you
must
present
me
with
a
conclusion
Here
you
have
a
conclusion
too
listen
to
our
wise
men
of
Moscow
they
're
a
set
of
nightingales
worth
listening
to
are
n't
they
Yes
that
's
the
pity
of
it
that
they
pipe
away
like
Kursk
nightingales
instead
of
talking
as
the
people
talk
Well
I
thought
and
thought
Science
to
be
sure
I
thought
is
everywhere
the
same
and
truth
is
the
same
so
I
was
up
and
off
in
God
's
name
to
foreign
parts
to
the
heathen
What
would
you
have
I
was
infatuated
with
youth
and
conceit
I
did
n't
want
you
know
to
get
fat
before
my
time
though
they
say
it
's
healthy
Though
indeed
if
nature
doesn't
put
the
flesh
on
your
bones
you
wo
n't
see
much
fat
on
your
body
'But
I
fancy
he
added
after
a
moment
's
thought
'I
promised
to
tell
you
how
I
got
married
listen
First
I
must
tell
you
that
my
wife
is
no
longer
living
secondly
secondly
I
see
I
must
give
you
some
account
of
my
youth
or
else
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
make
anything
out
of
it
But
do
n't
you
want
to
go
to
sleep
'No
I
'm
not
sleepy
'That
's
good
news
Hark
how
vulgarly
Mr
Kantagryuhin
is
snoring
in
the
next
room
I
was
the
son
of
parents
of
small
property
I
say
parents
because
according
to
tradition
I
had
once
had
a
father
as
well
as
a
mother
I
do
n't
remember
him
he
was
a
narrow-minded
man
I've
been
told
with
a
big
nose
freckles
and
red
hair
he
used
to
take
snuff
on
one
side
of
his
nose
only
