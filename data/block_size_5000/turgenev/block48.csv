has
never
spoken
to
me
before
'Spit
it
out
and
stamp
on
it
I
did
so
I
spat
it
out
and
trod
on
it
And
so
now
I
am
lost
forever
for
every
crime
is
forgiven
but
not
the
sin
against
the
Holy
Ghost
And
uttering
these
awful
words
my
son
fell
on
the
shelf
while
I
sank
down
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
My
legs
gave
way
under
me
Father
Alexey
was
silent
for
an
instant
and
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
But
why
should
I
worry
you
and
myself
any
longer
he
went
on
My
son
and
I
dragged
ourselves
home
and
soon
after
that
his
end
came
and
I
lost
my
Yakov
For
some
days
before
his
death
he
neither
ate
nor
drank
he
kept
walking
up
and
down
the
room
repeating
that
his
sin
could
not
be
forgiven
but
he
did
not
see
him
any
more
He
has
ruined
my
soul
he
said
why
should
he
come
any
more
And
as
soon
as
Yakov
took
to
his
bed
he
sank
into
unconsciousness
and
so
without
penitence
like
a
senseless
worm
he
passed
from
this
life
into
eternity
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
But
I
do
n't
want
to
believe
that
the
Lord
will
pass
stern
judgment
on
him
And
one
reason
why
I
can
not
believe
it
is
that
he
looked
very
beautiful
lying
in
the
coffin
he
seemed
to
have
grown
quite
young
again
and
looked
like
my
Yakov
of
old
days
His
face
was
so
pure
and
gentle
his
hair
curled
in
ringlets
and
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
Marfa
Savvishna
came
to
look
at
him
she
said
the
same
She
put
flowers
all
round
him
and
she
put
flowers
on
his
heart
and
she
put
a
stone
on
his
grave
at
her
own
expense
And
I
was
left
alone
And
that
is
why
sir
you
have
detected
great
sorrow
in
my
face
It
will
never
pass
away
it
never
can
I
wanted
to
say
some
word
of
comfort
to
Father
Alexey
but
I
could
not
find
any
thing
to
say
We
parted
soon
afterwards

There
was
nowhere
I
used
to
go
so
often
to
shoot
in
the
summer
as
to
the
village
of
Glin
noye
which
was
fifteen
miles
from
my
own
estate
Perhaps
the
best
place
for
game
in
our
whole
district
was
near
that
village
After
going
through
all
the
surrounding
thickets
and
fields
towards
the
end
of
the
day
I
invariably
turned
into
a
marsh
close
by
the
only
one
in
the
neighbourhood
and
from
there
went
back
to
my
hospitable
host
the
elder
of
the
village
with
whom
I
always
used
to
put
up
for
the
night
From
the
marsh
to
Glinnoye
it
is
not
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
The
road
runs
by
the
valley
except
that
halfway
one
has
to
climb
a
small
hill
On
the
top
of
that
hill
lies
a
homestead
consisting
of
a
small
uninhabited
manor-house
and
garden
It
almost
always
happened
to
me
to
pass
by
it
in
the
full
glow
of
the
sunset
and
I
remember
that
this
house
with
its
nailed-up
windows
reminded
me
of
a
blind
old
man
who
has
come
out
to
warm
him
self
in
the
sun
He
sits
poor
dear
close
to
the
road
The
light
of
the
sun
has
long
ago
passed
into
unchanging
darkness
for
him
but
he
feels
it
on
his
raised
and
outstretched
face
and
on
his
warmed
cheeks
It
seemed
as
though
no
one
had
lived
in
the
house
itself
for
years
but
in
the
tiny
lodge
in
the
garden
there
was
a
decrepit
house-serf
who
had
received
his
freedom
a
tall
stooping
grey-headed
old
man
with
an
expressive
and
immobile
face
He
was
always
sitting
on
a
little
bench
in
front
of
the
one
little
window
in
the
lodge
looking
with
mournful
dreaminess
into
the
distance
and
on
seeing
me
he
would
rise
a
little
from
his
seat
and
bow
with
the
deliberate
dignity
that
dis
tinguishes

eration
not
of
our
fathers
but
of
our
grand
fathers
I
used
to
speak
to
him
but
he
was
not
fond
of
talking
all
I
learned
from
him
was
that
the
place
on
which
he
was
living
belonged
to
the
granddaughter
of
his
old
master
a
widow
who
had
a
younger
sister
that
they
both
lived
in
towns
beyond
the
sea
and
that
they
never
showed
themselves
at
home
that
he
himself
would
like
to
end
his
days
as
soon
as
might
be
because
one
goes
on
munching
bread
till
one
is
weary
one
has
been
doing
it
so
long
The
old
man
's
name
was
Lukyanitch
One
day
I
somehow
lingered
late
in
the
fields
I
had
come
upon
a
good
deal
of
game
and
it
was
a
good
day
for
shooting
from
early
morning
still
and
grey
as
though
full
of
the
feeling
of
evening
I
wandered
far
and
it
was
not
merely
getting
dusk
but
the
moon
had
risen
and
night
as
the
saying
is
had
long
hung
over
the
sky
when
I
reached
the
familiar
house
I
had
to
walk
along
beside
the
fence
of
the
garden
There
was
perfect
stillness
all
around
crossed
the
high-road
cautiously
made
my
way
through
the
dusty
nettles
and
leaned
against
the
low
hurdle
The
little
garden
all
fragrant
and
dewy
lay
perfectly
still
before
me
all
lighted
up
and
as
it
were
soothed
to
rest
by
the
silver
rays
of
the
moon
laid
out
in
the
old-fashioned
style
it
consisted
of
one
oblong
plot
Little
straight
paths
met
at
a
round
flower-bed
in
the
very
centre
thickly
over
grown
with
asters
It
was
surrounded
by
an
even
border
of
tall
lime-trees
except
at
one
part
where
through
an
opening
about
fourteen
feet
wide
between
the
trees
I
saw
the
low
pitched
house
with
to
my
surprise
two
win
dows
lighted
up
Young
apple-trees
rose
here
and
there
above
the
lawn
the
soft
blue
of
the
night
sky
showed
through
their
slender
branches
bathed
in
the
slumbering
moonlight
before
each
apple-tree
its
faint
chequered
shadow
lay
on
the
silvery
grass
On
one
side
of
the
garden
the
lime-trees
flooded
with
pale
vivid
motionless
light
were
a
blur
of
dull
green
on
the
other
side
they
stood
all
black
and
opaque
a
strange
suppressed
rustle
arose
from
time
to
time
in
their
thick
foliage
they
seemed
to
be
THREE
MEETINGS
calling
one
to
the
paths
beneath
them
to
be
beckoning
one
to
their
dark
canopy
The
whole
sky
was
spangled
with
stars
their
soft
blue
radiance
flowed
mysteriously
from
on
high
they
seemed
gazing
with
gentle
attention
at
the
far-away
earth
Little
delicate
clouds
floated
now
and
again
across
the
moon
and
for
an
instant
changed
its
peaceful
light
to
a
vague
but
luminous
mist
Everything
was
slumbering
The
air
warm
and
fragrant
did
not
stir
only
from
time
to
time
it
quivered
as
water
quivers
at
the
fall
of
a
twig
There
was
a
feeling
of
languor
of
yearning
in
it
I
bent
over
the
fence
a
red
field
poppy
lifted
its
straight
stalk
above
the
rank
grass
before
me
and
a
great
round
drop
of
night
dew
glit
tered
with
a
dark
light
in
its
open
cup
Every
thing
was
slumbering
everything
lay
luxuri
ously
and
seemed
to
be
gazing
upwards
waiting
without
stirring
What
was
this
warm
not
yet
sleeping
night
awaiting
It
was
waiting
for
a
sound
a
living
voice
was
what
that
listening
silence
awaited
but
all
was
still
The
nightingales
had
long
ceased
singing
and
the
sudden
hum
of
a
beetle
flying
by
the
faint
splash
of
a
tiny
fish
in
the
pool
at
the
end
of
the
garden
beyond
the
lime-trees
the
drowsy
note
of
a
startled
bird
the
far-away
cry
in
the
fields
so
far
away
that
the
ear
could
not
distinguish
whether
it
was
the
cry
of
a
man
a
beast
or
a
bird
the
short
quick
thud
of
hoofs
upon
the
road
all
these
faint
sounds
these
rustles
only
deepened
the
stillness
My
heart
yearned
with
an
indescribable
feel
ing
that
was
akin
to
the
expectation
or
memory
of
happiness
I
dared
not
stir
I
stood
motion
less
before
the
motionless
garden
bathed
in
moonlight
and
dew
and
I
do
not
know
why
gazed
fixedly
at
those
two
windows
dimly
red
in
the
soft
half
shadow
when
suddenly
a
chord
rang
out
in
the
house
it
rang
out
and
rolled
away
hke
a
wave
The
sensitively
reso
nant
air
responded
with
an
echo
I
could
not
help
starting
A
woman
's
voice
rang
out
after
the
chord
I
began
listening
greedily
and
can
I
express
my
amazement
two
years
be
fore
in
Italy
at
Sorrento
I
had
heard
the
same
song
the
same
voice

THREE
MEETINGS
It
was
the
same
I
knew
those
strains
It
had
happened
hke
this
I
was
returning
home
after
a
long
walk
on
the
sea-shore
I
was
walking
rapidly
along
the
street
night
had
fallen
the
magnificent
night
of
the
South
not
still
and
mournfully
pensive
like
ours
no
all
bright
luxurious
and
lovely
as
a
happy
woman
in
the
flower
of
her
youth
the
moon
shone
with
incredible
brilliance
the
glittering
stars
seemed
quivering
in
the
dark-blue
sky
the
black
shadows
stood
out
sharply
against
the
earth
that
looked
almost
yellow
in
the
bright
light
On
both
sides
of
the
street
stretched
the
stone
walls
of
the
gardens
orange-trees
lifted
their
crooked
branches
above
them
the
golden
globes
of
the
heavy
fruit
could
just
be
seen
hidden
among
the
tangled
leaves
or
stood
out
vividly
displayed
in
all
their
richness
by
the
moon
On
many
of
the
trees
there
was
still
the
tender
whiteness
of
the
flowers
the
air
was
saturated
with
languorous
fragrance
powerful
poignant
and
almost
oppressive
yet
indescribably
sweet
I
walked
along
and
I
must
confess
I
had
grown
so
used
to
all
these
marvels
that
I
thought
i6i
of
nothing
but
getting
quickly
home
to
my
hotel
when
all
at
once
from
a
little
pavilion
built
right
upon
the
wall
beside
which
I
was
hurrying
there
came
the
sound
of
a
woman's
voice
It
was
singing
a
song
I
did
not
know
and
in
its
sound
there
was
a
note
of
such
eager
summons
it
seemed
so
full
of
the
passionate
and
joyful
expectation
expressed
in
the
words
of
the
song
that
I
could
not
help
stopping
short
at
once
and
raising
my
head
There
were
two
windows
in
the
pavihon
but
the
blinds
were
down
in
both
and
only
a
pale
light
filtered
through
their
narrow
chinks
After
repeating
twice
vieni
vieni
the
voice
died
away
I
heard
the
faint
twang
of
strings
as
though
of
a
guitar
falling
on
the
carpet
there
was
a
light
rustle
of
skirts
a
faint
creak
of
the
floor
The
streaks
of
light
vanished
from
one
win
dow
Someone
from
within
came
up
to
it
and
leaned
over
it
I
stepped
back
two
paces
All
at
once
the
blinds
rattled
and
were
thrust
back
a
graceful
woman
dressed
all
in
white
rapidly
thrust
her
charming
head
out
of
the
window
and
stretching
out
her
arms
to
me
said
Sei
tu
I
was
taken
aback
I
did
not
know
THREE
MEETINGS
what
to
say
but
at
the
same
instant
the
un
known
lady
darted
back
with
a
faint
cry
the
blind
was
dropped
and
the
light
in
the
pavilion
grew
even
dimmer
as
though
it
had
been
car
ried
off
into
another
room
I
stood
motion
less
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
I
came
to
myself
The
face
of
the
woman
who
had
so
suddenly
appeared
before
me
was
strikingly
beautiful
I
had
caught
too
hurried
a
glimpse
of
it
to
be
able
to
recall
at
once
each
separate
feature
but
the
general
impression
was
un
utterably
vivid
and
deep
I
felt
at
that
time
that
I
should
not
forget
that
face
all
my
life
The
moonlight
fell
straight
upon
the
wall
of
the
pavilion
on
the
window
at
which
she
had
shown
herself
and
my
God
how
magnificently
her
great
dark
eyes
had
shone
in
its
radiance
what
a
heavy
wave
of
half
loose
black
hair
fell
on
the
curve
of
her
lifted
shapely
shoulder
What
wealth
of
shy
luxurious
softness
in
the
soft
bending
of
her
waist
what
a
caress
in
her
voice
when
she
called
me
in
that
hurried
but
resonant
whisper
After
standing
for
some
time
on
the
same
spot
I
walked
a
little
aside
163
in
the
shadow
of
the
opposite
wall
and
fell
to
gazing
at
the
pavilion
with
a
sort
of
stupid
bewilderment
and
expectation
I
listened
listened
with
strained
attention
I
fan
cied
now
someone
softly
breathing
at
the
dark
ened
window
now
a
rustle
and
a
soft
laugh
At
last
there
came
the
sound
of
far-away
foot
steps
they
came
closer
a
man
of
about
the
same
height
as
myself
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
went
hurriedly
up
to
a
little
gate
which
I
had
not
noticed
before
close
to
the
pavilion
without
looking
round
knocked
twice
with
the
iron
ring
waited
a
little
knocked
again
and
sang
in
an
undertone
Ecco
ri
dente
The
gate
was
opened
he
noiselessly
glided
in
I
started
shook
my
head
and
with
a
gesture
of
perplexity
morosely
pulled
my
hat
over
my
eyes
and
discontentedly
set
off
home
Next
day
quite
fruitlessly
and
in
the
very
heat
of
the
day
I
walked
for
two
hours
up
and
down
the
street
by
the
pavilion
and
that
evening
I
left
Sorrento
without
hay
ing

Tasso
's
house
The
reader
may
well
imagine
the
amazement
with
which
I
was
instantly
overcome
when
I
164
THREE
MEETINGS
heard
the
same
voice
the
same
song
in
the
steppe
in
one
of
the
remotest
parts
of
Rus
sia
As
then
it
was
night
as
then
the
voice
rang
out
from
a
Hghted
unknown
room
as
then
I
was
alone
My
heart
beat
violently
Is
n't
it
a
dream
I
thought
And
then
I
heard
again
the
last
Vieni
Would
the
window
open
Would
the
woman
show
her
self
The
window
was
opened
At
the
win
dow
a
woman
appeared
I
recognised
her
at
once
though
there
was
the
distance
of
fifty
paces
between
us
though
a
light
cloud
veiled
the
moon
It
was
she
my
unknown
lady
of
Sorrento
But
she
did
not
as
before
stretch
her
bare
arms
out
of
the
window
she
softly
folded
them
and
leaning
them
on
the
window-sill
fell
to
gazing
into
i^^e
garden
silently
without
mov
ing
Yes
it
was
she
those
were
her
features
which
I
could
never
forget
those
were
the
eyes
of
which
I
had
never
seen
the
like
As
before
a
full
white
dress
enfolded
her
limbs
She
looked
a
little
plumper
than
at
Sorrento
Every
thing
about
her
was
fragrant
of
the
confidence
and
repose
of
love
of
the
triumph
of
beauty
soothed
by
happiness
For
a
long
while
she
did
not
stir
then
looked
back
into
the
room
and
sud
denly
drawing
herself
up
exclaimed
three
times
in
a
loud
and
ringing
voice
Addiol
The
lovely
sounds
floated
far
far
away
and
for
a
long
time
their
vibrations
lingered
growing
fainter
and
dying
away
above
the
lime-trees
in
the
garden
and
in
the
fields
behind
me
and
in
all
directions
For
some
moments
all
the
coun
try
round
me
was
full
of
that
woman
's
voice
everything
was
ringing
in
response
to
it
was
ringing
with
it
She
closed
the
window
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
light
in
the
house
was
put
out
As
soon
as
I
recovered
myself
which
I
con
fess
was
not
very
quickly
I
walked
at
once
beside
the
garden
towards
the
lodge
went
up
to
the
closed
gates
and
looked
over
the
fence
Nothing
exceptional
could
be
seen
in
the
yard
a
carriage
was
standing
in
the
corner
under
a
shed
The
fore
part
of
it
bespattered
with
dry
mud
looked
white
in
the
moonlight
The
shut
ters
in
the
house
were
closed
as
before
I
for
got
to
say
I
had
not
visited
Glinnoye
for
about
a
week
For
over
half
an
hour
I
walked
up
and
down
before
the
fence
in
perplexity
so
l66
THREE
MEETINGS
that
at
last
I
attracted
the
attention
of
the
old
house-dog
he
did
not
bark
however
but
only
looked
at
me
from
his
seat
under
the
gate
with
extraordinary
irony
in
his
screwed-up
purblind
eyes
I
understood
his
hint
and
made
off
But
I
riad
not
gone
half
a
mile
before
I
heard
the
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
behind
me
a
few
moments
later
a
man
on
a
black
horse
dashed
by
me
at
a
quick
trot
Rapidly
turn
ing
his
face
towards
me
so
that
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
eagle
nose
and
handsome
mous
tache
under
a
cap
pulled
forward
on
his
fore
head
he
took
the
road
to
the
right
and
imme
diately
vanished
behind
the
copse
So
that
is
he
I
thought
and
my
heart
was
strangely
stirred
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
recog
nised
him
his
figure
certainly
reminded
me
of
the
man
whom
I
had
seen
go
in
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
in
Sorrento
Half
an
hour
later
I
was
at
Glinnoye
at
the
elder
's
I
woke
him
up
and
at
once
began
asking
him
who
had
come
to
that
house
He
answered
me
with
an
effort
that
the
ladies
M'ho
owned
it
had
arrived
What
ladies
I
asked
impatiently
Why
the
ladies
to
be
sure
he
answered
very
listlessly
But
what
sort
of
ladies
Why
like
any
ladies
to
be
sure
Russian
Why
what
else
should
they
be
Russian
to
be
sure
Not
foreigners
Eh
Is
it
long
since
they
arrived
y
That
I
could
n't
say
Are
they
rich
That
we
ca
n't
tell
Maybe
they
are
Did
not
some
gentleman
come
with
them
A
gentleman
Yes
a
gentleman
The
elder
heaved
a
sigh
Oh
Lord
he
brought
out
yawning
No-oo
no
gentleman
no
gentleman
I
think
I
ca
n't
say
he
added
suddenly
And
what
sort
of
neighbours
are
there
liv
ing
here
What
sort
of
neighbours
Why
all
sorts
to
be
sure
All
sorts
and
what
's
their
name
i68
Three
meetings
Whose
name
The
ladies
or
the
neigh
bours
The
ladies
The
elder
heaved
a
sigh
again
What
's
their
name
he
muttered
Good
ness
knows
what
their
name
is
The
elder
one
I
fancy
is
Anna
Fyodorovna
and
the
other
No
I
do
n't
know
what
the
other
's
name
is
Well
what
is
their
surname
anyway
Surname
Yes
surname
family
name
Family
name
yes
But
I
really
do
n't
know
it
Are
they
young
Well
no
not
that
How
so
Why
the
younger
one
will
be
over
forty
That
's
all
fibs
The
elder
was
silent
for
a
space
Well
you
know
best
We
ca
n't
say
There
you
are
at
it
again
I
exclaimed
with
vexation
Knowing
by
experience
that
when
a
Russian
takes
to
answering
in
that
way
there
is
no
possibility
of
getting
anything
sensible
tHE
TWO
FklENl
S
AND
OTHER
STORIES
out
of
him
moreover
my
host
had
only
just
Iain
down
to
sleep
and
at
every
answer
he
gave
a
faint
lurch
forward
opening
his
eyes
wide
with
babyish
wonder
and
with
difficulty
part
ing
his
lips
smeared
with
the
honey
of
the
first
sweet
sleep
I
made
a
gesture
of
despair
and
refusing
supper
went
to
the
bam
For
a
long
time
I
could
not
sleep
What
is
she
I
was
continually
asking
myself
A
Russian
If
she
is
Russian
why
does
she
speak
Italian
The
elder
makes
out
that
she
is
not
young
But
he
is
lying
And
who
is
that
happy
man
There
is
no
making
it
out
at
all
But
what
a
strange
adventure
Is
it
possible
it
has
happened
like
this
twice
Anyway
I
will
find
out
who
she
is
and
why
she
has
come
here
Excited
by
these
confused
and
disconnected
thoughts
I
fell
asleep
late
and
had
strange
dreams
At
one
moment
I
fancied
I
was
wandering
somewhere
in
the
wilderness
in
the
very
heat
of
mid-day
and
suddenly
I
saw
before
me
racing
over
the
baked
yellow
sand
a
great
patch
of
shadow
I
raised
my
head
she
my
beautiful
lady
was
floating
THREE
MEETINGS
through
the
air
all
white
with
long
white
wings
and
beckoning
me
to
her
I
rushed
after
her
but
she
floated
lightly
and
rapidly
and
I
could
not
rise
up
from
the
earth
and
stretched
out
eager
arms
in
vain
Addio
she
said
to
me
flying
away
Why
have
you
no
wing3
Addio
and
then
from
all
sides
I
heard
Addio
every
grain
of
sand
was
shouting
and
shrieking
to
me
Addio
That
i
rang
out
in
an
insufferable
sharp
trill
I
waved
it
away
like
a
gnat
I
looked
for
her
but
she
had
already
become
a
little
cloud
and
waf
softly
mounting
to
the
sun
the
sun
quivered
trembled
laughed
stretched
out
long
golden
threads
to
meet
her
and
now
she
was
tangled
in
those
threads
and
melting
into
them
while
I
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
like
one
pos
sessed
It
's
not
the
sun
it
's
not
the
sun
it's
that
Italian
spider
who
gave
him
a
passport
to
Russia
I
will
expose
him
I
saw
him
steal
ing
oranges
in
other
people
's
gardens
Then
I
dreamed
I
was
walking
along
a
nar
row
mountain
path
I
was
hurrying
I
had
to
get
somewhere
in
haste
some
unheard
of
happiness
was
awaiting
me
all
at
once
a
huge
cliff
rose
up
before
me
I
looked
for
a
path
I
went
to
the
right
I
went
to
the
left
there
was
no
way
to
pass
And
suddenly
be
yond
the
rock
a
voice
rang
out
Passa
passa
que
colli
It
was
calling
me
that
voice
it
repeated
its
mournful
summons
I
rushed
about
in
my
misery
seeking
for
the
smallest
crevice
Alas
It
was
an
overhanging
wall
granite
on
all
sides
Passa
que
colli
the
voice
repeated
plaintively
My
heart
ached
I
flung
myself
against
the
smooth
stone
in
my
frenzy
I
tore
it
with
my
nails
A
dark
passage
suddenly
opened
before
me
Faint
with
joy
I
struggled
forward
Nonsense
someone
shouted
to
me
You
shall
not
pass
I
looked
up
Lukyanitch
was
standing
before
me
waving
his
arms
and
threatening
me
I
hurriedly
fumbled
in
my
pockets
I
meant
to
bribe
him
but
I
could
find
nothing
in
my
pockets
Lukyanitch
I
said
to
him
Lukyanitch
let
me
pass
I
will
reward
you
afterwards
You
are
mistaken
Signor
Lukyanitch
an
swered
and
his
face
assumed
a
strange
expres
sion
I
am
not
a
servant
recognise
in
me
THREE
MEETINGS
Don
Quixote
De
La
Mancha
the
famous
knight-errant
I
have
been
all
my
life
seeking
my
Dulcinea
and
could
not
find
her
and
I
can
not
endure
that
you
should
find
yours
Passa
que
colli
the
voice
almost
sob
bing
rings
out
again
Stand
aside
Signor
I
cried
with
fury
and
was
on
the
point
of
dashing
forward
but
the
knight
's
long
lance
struck
me
to
the
heart
I
fell
like
one
dead
I
lay
on
my
back
I
could
not
stir
and
behold
I
saw
her
coming
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
gracefully
holding
it
above
her
head
Looking
about
her
in
the
dark
ness
and
cautiously
stealing
up
she
bent
down
over
me
So
this
is
he
that
fool
He
tried
to
find
out
who
I
am
she
said
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
and
the
burning
oil
of
her
lamp
dropped
straight
on
my
wounded
heart
Psyche
I
cried
with
an
effort
and
woke
up
I
slept
badly
all
night
and
was
on
my
feet
before
it
was
light
Hurriedly
dressing
and
taking
my
gun
I
set
off
at
once
for
the
house
My
impatience
was
so
great
that
the
sunrise
was
only
beginning
by
the
time
I
reached
the
m
familiar
gates
The
larks
were
singing
all
around
jackdaws
were
cawing
on
the
birch
trees
but
in
the
house
everything
was
sleeping
the
deep
sleep
of
morning
Even
the
dog
was
snoring
behind
the
fence
In
an
agony
of
ex
pectation
strained
almost
to
anger
I
walked
up
and
down
the
dewy
grass
looking
incessantly
at
the
low-pitched
and
ugly
little
house
which
sheltered
this
enigmatic
creature
within
its
walls
All
at
once
the
little
gate
gave
a
faint
creak
and
opened
and
Lukyanitch
appeared
in
the
gateway
wearing
a
kind
of
striped
Cossack
coat
His
face
with
its
ruffled
hair
seemed
to
me
more
morose
than
ever
Looking
at
me
not
without
some
amazement
he
was
about
to
shut
the
gate
again
My
good
man
my
good
man
I
cried
out
hurriedly
What
do
you
want
at
such
an
early
hour
he
replied
slowly
in
a
hollow
voice
Tell
me
please
your
mistress
has
come
I
am
told
Lukyanitch
was
silent
for
a
moment
Yes
she
has
come
Alone
THREE
MEETINGS
With
her
sister
Had
n't
they
visitors
yesterday
No
And
he
pulled
the
gate
towards
him
Stay
stay
my
good
man
do
me
the
favour
Lukyanitch
coughed
and
shrank
together
from
the
cold
Why
what
is
it
you
want
Tell
me
please
how
old
is
your
mistress
Lukyanitch
glanced
at
me
suspiciously
How
old
is
my
mistress
I
do
n't
know
Over
forty
she
must
be
Over
forty
And
how
old
is
her
sister
Why
she
's
about
forty
Impossible
And
is
she
good-looking
Who
the
sister
Yes
the
sister
Lukyanitch
gave
a
laugh
I
do
n't
know
that
is
as
one
fancies
to
my
thinking
she
is
not
How
so
Oh
she
's
not
much
to
boast
of
Rather
weakly
looking
Oh
indeed
And
has
no
one
else
come
7
No
one
Who
should
come
But
that
can
not
be
I
Eh
sir
we
shall
never
have
done
talking
the
old
man
answered
with
vexation
It
's
so
cold
Pray
excuse
me
Stay
stay
here
's
and
I
held
out
a
quarter
rouble
I
had
got
ready
beforehand
but
my
hand
knocked
against
the
rapidly
slammed
gate
The
silver
coin
fell
on
the
earth
rolled
away
and
lay
at
my
feet
Ah
the
old
rogue
I
thought
Don
Quixote
De
La
Mancha
you
have
been
told
to
hold
your
tongue
it
seems
but
wait
a
bit
you
won't
get
rid
of
me
so
easily
I
vowed
to
myself
that
come
what
may
I
would
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
For
about
half
an
hour
I
walked
up
and
down
not
knowing
what
course
to
decide
upon
At
last
I
made
up
my
mind
first
to
find
out
in
the
village
who
had
arrived
at
the
place
and
whose
it
was
then
to
come
back
again
and
as
the
saying
is
not
to
give
it
up
till
the
mystery
was
explained
My
unknown
lady
would
come
out
into
the
garden
I
should
see
her
at
last
by
daylight
from
close
by
as
a
living
woman
not
as
an
THREE
MEETINGS
apparition
The
village
was
less
than
a
mile
away
and
I
set
off
at
once
in
that
direction
stepping
out
lightly
and
confidently
A
strange
defiance
was
rising
and
working
in
my
blood
the
invigorating
freshness
of
morning
strung
me
up
after
my
restless
night
In
the
village
I
learned
all
that
was
to
be
learned
from
two
peasants
on
their
way
to
work
that
is
that
the
place
together
with
the
village
I
had
reached
was
called
Mihailovskoye
that
it
belonged
to
the
widow
of
a
major
a
lady
called
Anna
Fyodorovna
Shlykov
that
she
had
an
unmarried
sister
called
Pelageya
Fyo
dorovna
Badayev
that
they
were
both
getting
on
in
years
and
were
wealthy
that
they
scarcely
ever
stayed
at
home
but
were
always
travelling
about
that
they
kept
no
servants
but
two
maids
and
a
man
cook
that
Anna
Fyodorovna
had
arrived
a
few
days
before
from
Moscow
ac
companied
by
no
one
but
her
sister
This
last
circumstance
disconcerted
me
greatly
I
could
not
suppose
that
the
peasants
too
had
orders
to
say
nothing
about
my
unknown
lady
But
to
admit
that
Anna
Fyodorovna
Shlykov
a
wido\y
of
five
and
forty
and
the
charming
71
young
woman
I
had
seen
the
night
before
were
the
same
person
was
impossible
Pelageya
Fyodorovna
was
according
to
the
description
of
her
not
distinguished
by
beauty
either
and
besides
at
the
very
thought
that
the
woman
I
had
seen
in
Sorrento
could
be
called
Pelageya
and
worse
still
Badayev
I
shrugged
my
shoul
ders
and
laughed
angrily
And
yet
I
had
seen
her
yesterday
in
that
house
seen
her
seen
her
with
my
own
eyes
I
thought
Thor
oughly
vexed
roused
to
fury
but
still
more
persistent
in
my
intention
I
was
on
the
point
of
going
back
to
the
garden
but
I
glanced
at
my
watch
it
was
not
yet
six
o'clock
I
made
up
my
mind
to
wait
a
little
At
the
house
everyone
was
most
likely
still
asleep
And
to
hang
about
it
at
such
an
hour
would
only
have
been
exciting
suspicion
for
nothing
moreover
there
was
a
stretch
of
bushes
before
me
and
beyond
them
I
could
see
a
copse
of
aspen-trees
I
must
do
myself
the
jus
tice
to
say
that
in
spite
of
the
thoughts
that
were
exciting
me
the
noble
passion
for
the
chase
was
not
utterly
eclipsed
Maybe
I
thought
I
shall
come
upon
a
covey
and
the
Z8
THREE
MEETINGS
time
will
pass
I
went
into
the
thicket
But
to
tell
the
truth
I
