I
knew
Stepan
Sergyeitch
Kuzovkin
a
good
fellow
that
's
to
say
really
a
regular
bad
lot
So
he
came
up
and
said
this
and
that
and
How
could
you
do
so
Piotr
Petrovitch
The
liability
is
serious
and
the
laws
very
distinct
on
the
subject
I
tell
him
Well
we
'll
have
a
talk
about
that
of
course
but
come
you
'll
take
a
little
something
after
your
drive
He
agreed
to
take
something
but
he
said
Justice
has
claims
Piotr
Petrovitch
think
for
yourself
Justice
to
be
sure
said
I
of
course
but
I
have
heard
say
you
've
a
little
black
horse
Would
you
be
willing
to
exchange
it
for
my
Lampurdos
But
there
's
no
girl
called
Matrona
Fedorovna
in
my
keeping
Come
says
he
Piotr
Petrovitch
the
girl
's
with
you
we
're
not
living
in
Switzerland
you
know
though
my
little
horse
might
be
exchanged
for
Lampurdos
I
might
to
be
sure
accept
it
in
that
way
However
I
managed
to
get
rid
of
him
somehow
that
time
But
the
old
lady
made
a
greater
fuss
than
ever
ten
thousand
roubles
she
said
she
would
n't
grudge
over
the
business
You
see
when
she
saw
me
she
suddenly
took
an
idea
into
her
head
to
marry
me
to
her
young
lady
companion
in
green
that
I
found
out
later
that
was
why
she
was
so
spiteful
What
ideas
wo
n't
these
great
ladies
take
into
their
heads
It
comes
through
being
dull
I
suppose
Things
went
badly
with
me
I
did
n't
spare
money
and
I
kept
Matrona
in
hiding
No
they
harassed
me
and
turned
me
this
way
and
that
I
got
into
debt
I
lost
my
health
So
one
night
as
I
lay
in
my
bed
thinking
My
God
why
should
I
suffer
so
What
am
I
to
do
since
I
ca
n't
get
over
loving
her
There
I
ca
n't
and
that
's
all
about
it
into
the
room
walked
Matrona
I
had
hidden
her
for
the
time
at
a
farmhouse
a
mile
and
a
half
from
my
house
I
was
frightened
What
have
they
discovered
you
even
there
No
Piotr
Petrovitch
said
she
no
one
disturbs
me
at
Bubnova
but
will
that
last
long
My
heart
she
said
is
torn
Piotr
Petrovitch
I
am
sorry
for
you
my
dear
one
never
shall
I
forget
your
goodness
Piotr
Petrovitch
but
now
I
've
come
to
say
good-bye
to
you
What
do
you
mean
what
do
you
mean
you
mad
girl
Good-bye
how
good-bye
Yes
I
am
going
to
give
myself
up
But
I
'll
lock
you
up
in
a
garret
mad
girl
Do
you
mean
to
destroy
me
Do
you
want
to
kill
me
or
what
The
girl
was
silent
she
looked
on
the
floor
Come
speak
speak
I
ca
n't
bear
to
cause
you
any
more
trouble
Piotr
Petrovitch
Well
one
might
talk
to
her
as
one
pleased
But
do
you
know
little
fool
do
you
know
mad
And
Piotr
Petrovitch
sobbed
bitterly
'Well
what
do
you
think
he
went
on
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
and
trying
to
frown
while
the
tears
still
coursed
down
his
flushed
cheeks
'the
girl
gave
herself
up
She
went
and
gave
herself
up
'The
horses
are
ready
the
overseer
cried
triumphantly
entering
the
room
We
both
stood
up
'What
became
of
Matrona
I
asked
Karataev
waved
his
hand
A
year
after
my
meeting
with
Karataev
I
happened
to
go
to
Moscow
One
day
before
dinner
for
some
reason
or
other
I
went
into
a
caf
in
the
Ohotny
row
an
original
Moscow
caf
In
the
billiard-room
across
clouds
of
smoke
I
caught
glimpses
of
flushed
faces
whiskers
old-fashioned
Hungarian
coats
and
new-fangled
Slavonic
costumes
Thin
little
old
men
in
sober
surtouts
were
reading
the
Russian
papers
The
waiters
flitted
airily
about
with
trays
treading
softly
on
the
green
carpets
Merchants
with
painful
concentration
were
drinking
tea
Suddenly
a
man
came
out
of
the
billiard-room
rather
dishevelled
and
not
quite
steady
on
his
legs
He
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
bent
his
head
and
looked
aimlessly
about
'Ba
ba
ba
Piotr
Petrovitch
How
are
you
Piotr
Petrovitch
almost
fell
on
my
neck
and
slightly
staggering
drew
me
into
a
small
private
room
'Come
here
he
said
carefully
seating
me
in
an
easy-chair
'here
you
will
be
comfortable
Waiter
beer
No
I
mean
champagne
There
I'll
confess
I
did
n't
expect
I
did
n't
expect
Have
you
been
here
long
Are
you
staying
much
longer
Well
God
has
brought
us
as
they
say
together
'Yes
do
you
remember
'To
be
sure
I
remember
to
be
sure
I
remember
he
interrupted
me
hurriedly
'it
's
a
thing
of
the
past
'Well
what
are
you
doing
here
my
dear
Piotr
Petrovitch
'I
'm
living
as
you
can
see
Life
's
first-rate
here
they
're
a
merry
lot
here
Here
I
've
found
peace
And
he
sighed
and
raised
his
eyes
towards
heaven
'Are
you
in
the
service
'No
I
'm
not
in
the
service
yet
but
I
think
I
shall
enter
But
what's
the
service
People
are
the
chief
thing
What
people
I
have
got
to
know
here
A
boy
came
in
with
a
bottle
of
champagne
on
a
black
tray
'There
and
this
is
a
good
fellow
Is
n't
that
true
Vasya
that
you
're
a
good
fellow
To
your
health
The
boy
stood
a
minute
shook
his
head
decorously
smiled
and
went
out
'Yes
there
are
capital
people
here
pursued
Piotr
Petrovitch
'people
of
soul
of
feeling
Would
you
like
me
to
introduce
you
such
jolly
chaps
They
'll
all
be
glad
to
know
you
I
say
Bobrov
is
dead
that
's
a
sad
thing
'What
Bobrov
'Sergay
Bobrov
he
was
a
capital
fellow
he
took
me
under
his
wing
as
an
ignoramus
from
the
wilds
And
Panteley
Gornostaev
is
dead
All
dead
all
'Have
you
been
living
all
the
time
in
Moscow
You
have
n't
been
away
to
the
country
'To
the
country
My
country
place
is
sold
'Sold
'By
auction
There
what
a
pity
you
did
n't
buy
it
'What
are
you
going
to
live
on
Piotr
Petrovitch
'I
sha
n't

of
hunger
God
will
provide
when
I
've
no
money
I
shall
have
friends
And
what
is
money
Dust
and
ashes
Gold
is
dust
He
shut
his
eyes
felt
in
his
pocket
and
held
out
to
me
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
two
sixpences
and
a
penny
'What
's
that
Is
n't
it
dust
and
ashes
and
the
money
flew
on
the
floor
'But
you
had
better

me

you

Polezhaev
'Yes
'Have
you
seen
Motchalov
in
Hamlet
'No
I
have
n't
'You
've
not

him
not
seen

And
Karataev
's
face
turned
pale
his
eyes
strayed
uneasily
he
turned
away
a
faint
spasm
passed
over
his
lips
'Ah
Motchalov
Motchalov
To
die
to
sleep
he
said
in
a
thick
voice
'No
more
and
by
a
sleep
to
say
we
end
The
heart-ache
and
the
thousand
natural
shocks
That
flesh
is
heir
to
't
is
a
consummation
Devoutly
to
be
wished
To
die
to
sleep
'To
sleep
to
sleep
he
muttered
several
times
'Tell
me
please
I
began
but
he
went
on
with
fire
'Who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
The
oppressor
's
wrong
the
proud
man
's
contumely
The
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
That
patient
merit
of
the
unworthy
takes
When
he
himself
might
his
quietus
make
With
a
bare
bodkin
Nymph
in
thy
orisons
Be
all
my
sins
remembered
And
he
dropped
his
head
on
the
table
He
began
stammering
and
talking
at
random
'Within
a
month
he
delivered
with
fresh
fire
'A
little
month
or
ere
those
shoes
were
old
With
which
she
followed
my
poor
father
's
body
Like
Niobe
all
tears
why
she
even
she
O
God
a
beast
that
wants
discourse
of
reason
Would
have
mourned
longer
He
raised
a
glass
of
champagne
to
his
lips
but
did
not
drink
off
the
wine
and
went
on
'For
Hecuba
What
's
Hecuba
to
him
or
he
to
Hecuba
That
he
should
weep
for
her
But
I
'm
a
dull

muddy
mettled-rascal
Who

the

I

But
I

pigeon-livered

lack
gall
To
make
oppression
bitter
Karataev
put
down
the
glass
and
grabbed
at
his
head
I
fancied
I
understood
him
'Well
well
he
said
at
last
'one
must
not
rake
up
the
past
Isn't
that
so
and
he
laughed
'To
your
health
'Shall
you
stay
in
Moscow
I
asked
him
'I
shall
die
in
Moscow
'Karataev
called
a
voice
in
the
next
room
'Karataev
where
are
you
Come
here
my
dear
fellow
'They
're
calling
me
he
said
getting
up
heavily
from
his
seat
'Good-bye
come
and
see
me
if
you
can
I
live
in
But
next
day
through
unforeseen
circumstances
I
was
obliged
to
leave
Moscow
and
I
never
saw
Piotr
Petrovitch
Karataev
again
THE
TRYST
I
was
sitting
in
a
birchwood
in
autumn
about
the
middle
of
September
From
early
morning
a
fine
rain
had
been
falling
with
intervals
from
time
to
time
of
warm
sunshine
the
weather
was
unsettled
The
sky
was
at
one
time
overcast
with
soft
white
clouds
at
another
it
suddenly
cleared
in
parts
for
an
instant
and
then
behind
the
parting
clouds
could
be
seen
a
blue
bright
and
tender
as
a
beautiful
eye
I
sat
looking
about
and
listening
The
leaves
faintly
rustled
over
my
head
from
the
sound
of
them
alone
one
could
tell
what
time
of
year
it
was
It
was
not
the
gay
laughing
tremor
of
the
spring
nor
the
subdued
whispering
the
prolonged
gossip
of
the
summer
nor
the
chill
and
timid
faltering
of
late
autumn
but
a
scarcely
audible
drowsy
chatter
A
slight
breeze
was
faintly
humming
in
the
tree-tops
Wet
with
the
rain
the
copse
in
its
inmost
recesses
was
for
ever
changing
as
the
sun
shone
or
hid
behind
a
cloud
at
one
moment
it
was
all
a
radiance
as
though
suddenly
everything
were
smiling
in
it
the
slender
stems
of
the
thinly-growing
birch-trees
took
all
at
once
the
soft
lustre
of
white
silk
the
tiny
leaves
lying
on
the
earth
were
on
a
sudden
flecked
and
flaring
with
purplish
gold
and
the
graceful
stalks
of
the
high
curly
bracken
decked
already
in
their
autumn
colour
the
hue
of
an
over-ripe
grape
seemed
interlacing
in
endless
tangling
crisscross
before
one
's
eyes
then
suddenly
again
everything
around
was
faintly
bluish
the
glaring
tints
died
away
instantaneously
the
birch-trees
stood
all
white
and
lustreless
white
as
fresh-fallen
snow
before
the
cold
rays
of
the
winter
sun
have
caressed
it
and
slily
stealthily
there
began
drizzling
and
whispering
through
the
wood
the
finest
rain
The
leaves
on
the
birches
were
still
almost
all
green
though
perceptibly
paler
only
here
and
there
stood
one
young
leaf
all
red
or
golden
and
it
was
a
sight
to
see
how
it
flamed
in
the
sunshine
when
the
sunbeams
suddenly
pierced
with
tangled
flecks
of
light
through
the
thick
network
of
delicate
twigs
freshly
washed
by
the
sparkling
rain
Not
one
bird
could
be
heard
all
were
in
hiding
and
silent
except
that
at
times
there
rang
out
the
metallic
bell-like
sound
of
the
jeering
tomtit
Before
halting
in
this
birch
copse
I
had
been
through
a
wood
of
tall
aspen-trees
with
my
dog
I
confess
I
have
no
great
liking
for
that
tree
the
aspen
with
its
pale-lilac
trunk
and
the
greyish-green
metallic
leaves
which
it
flings
high
as
it
can
and
unfolds
in
a
quivering
fan
in
the
air
I
do
not
care
for
the
eternal
shaking
of
its
round
slovenly
leaves
awkwardly
hooked
on
to
long
stalks
It
is
only
fine
on
some
summer
evenings
when
rising
singly
above
low
undergrowth
it
faces
the
reddening
beams
of
the
setting
sun
and
shines
and
quivers
bathed
from
root
to
top
in
one
unbroken
yellow
glow
or
when
on
a
clear
windy
day
it
is
all
rippling
rustling
and
whispering
to
the
blue
sky
and
every
leaf
is
as
it
were
taken
by
a
longing
to
break
away
to
fly
off
and
soar
into
the
distance
But
as
a
rule
I
do
n't
care
for
the
tree
and
so
not
stopping
to
rest
in
the
aspen
wood
I
made
my
way
to
the
birch-copse
nestled
down
under
one
tree
whose
branches
started
low
down
near
the
ground
and
were
consequently
capable
of
shielding
me
from
the
rain
and
after
admiring
the
surrounding
view
a
little
I
fell
into
that
sweet
untroubled
sleep
only
known
to
sportsmen
I
can
not
say
how
long
I
was
asleep
but
when
I
opened
my
eyes
all
the
depths
of
the
wood
were
filled
with
sunlight
and
in
all
directions
across
the
joyously
rustling
leaves
there
were
glimpses
and
as
it
were
flashes
of
intense
blue
sky
the
clouds
had
vanished
driven
away
by
the
blustering
wind
the
weather
had
changed
to
fair
and
there
was
that
feeling
of
peculiar
dry
freshness
in
the
air
which
fills
the
heart
with
a
sense
of
boldness
and
is
almost
always
a
sure
sign
of
a
still
bright
evening
after
a
rainy
day
I
was
just
about
to
get
up
and
try
my
luck
again
when
suddenly
my
eyes
fell
on
a
motionless
human
figure
I
looked
attentively
it
was
a
young
peasant
girl
She
was
sitting
twenty
paces
off
her
head
bent
in
thought
and
her
hands
lying
in
her
lap
one
of
them
half-open
held
a
big
nosegay
of
wild
flowers
which
softly
stirred
on
her
checked
petticoat
with
every
breath
Her
clean
white
smock
buttoned
up
at
the
throat
and
wrists
lay
in
short
soft
folds
about
her
figure
two
rows
of
big
yellow
beads
fell
from
her
neck
to
her
bosom
She
was
very
pretty
Her
thick
fair
hair
of
a
lovely
almost
ashen
hue
was
parted
into
two
carefully
combed
semicircles
under
the
narrow
crimson
fillet
which
was
brought
down
almost
on
to
her
forehead
white
as
ivory
the
rest
of
her
face
was
faintly
tanned
that
golden
hue
which
is
only
taken
by
a
delicate
skin
I
could
not
see
her
eyes
she
did
not
raise
them
but
I
saw
her
delicate
high
eye-brows
her
long
lashes
they
were
wet
and
on
one
of
her
cheeks
there
shone
in
the
sun
the
traces
of
quickly
drying
tears
reaching
right
down
to
her
rather
pale
lips
Her
little
head
was
very
charming
altogether
even
her
rather
thick
and
snub
nose
did
not
spoil
her
I
was
especially
taken
with
the
expression
of
her
face
it
was
so
simple
and
gentle
so
sad
and
so
full
of
childish
wonder
at
its
own
sadness
She
was
obviously
waiting
for
some
one
something
made
a
faint
crackling
in
the
wood
she
raised
her
head
at
once
and
looked
round
in
the
transparent
shade
I
caught
a
rapid
glimpse
of
her
eyes
large
clear
and
timorous
like
a
fawn
's
For
a
few
instants
she
listened
not
moving
her
wide
open
eyes
from
the
spot
whence
the
faint
sound
had
come
she
sighed
turned
her
head
slowly
bent
still
lower
and
began
sorting
her
flowers
Her
eyelids
turned
red
her
lips
twitched
faintly
and
a
fresh
tear
rolled
from
under
her
thick
eyelashes
and
stood
brightly
shining
on
her
cheek
Rather
a
long
while
passed
thus
the
poor
girl
did
not
stir
except
for
a
despairing
movement
of
her
hands
now
and
then
and
she
kept
listening
listening
Again
there
was
a
crackling
sound
in
the
wood
she
started
The
sound
did
not
cease
grew
more
distinct
and
came
closer
at
last
one
could
hear
quick
resolute
footsteps
She
drew
herself
up
and
seemed
frightened
her
intent
gaze
was
all
aquiver
all
aglow
with
expectation
Through
the
thicket
quickly
appeared
the
figure
of
a
man
She
gazed
at
it
suddenly
flushed
gave
a
radiant
blissful
smile
tried
to
rise
and
sank
back
again
at
once
turned
white
and
confused
and
only
raised
her
quivering
almost
supplicating
eyes
to
the
man
approaching
when
the
latter
stood
still
beside
her
I
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
from
my
ambush
I
confess
he
did
not
make
an
agreeable
impression
on
me
He
was
to
judge
by
external
signs
the
pampered
valet
of
some
rich
young
gentleman
His
attire
betrayed
pretensions
to
style
and
fashionable
carelessness
he
wore
a
shortish
coat
of
a
bronze
colour
doubtless
from
his
master
's
wardrobe
buttoned
up
to
the
top
a
pink
cravat
with
lilac
ends
and
a
black
velvet
cap
with
a
gold
ribbon
pulled
forward
right
on
to
his
eyebrows
The
round
collar
of
his
white
shirt
mercilessly
propped
up
his
ears
and
cut
his
cheeks
and
his
starched
cuffs
hid
his
whole
hand
to
the
red
crooked
fingers
adorned
by
gold
and
silver
rings
with
turquoise
forget-me-nots
His
red
fresh
impudent-looking
face
belonged
to
the
order
of
faces
which
as
far
as
I
have
observed
are
almost
always
repulsive
to
men
and
unfortunately
are
very
often
attractive
to
women
He
was
obviously
trying
to
give
a
scornful
and
bored
expression
to
his
coarse
features
he
was
incessantly
screwing
up
his
milky
grey
eyes
small
enough
at
all
times
he
scowled
dropped
the
corners
of
his
mouth
affected
to
yawn
and
with
careless
though
not
perfectly
natural
nonchalance
pushed
back
his
modishly
curled
red
locks
or
pinched
the
yellow
hairs
sprouting
on
his
thick
upper
lip
in
fact
he
gave
himself
insufferable
airs
He
began
his
antics
directly
he
caught
sight
of
the
young
peasant
girl
waiting
for
him
slowly
with
a
swaggering
step
he
went
up
to
her
stood
a
moment
shrugging
his
shoulders
stuffed
both
hands
in
his
coat
pockets
and
barely
vouchsafing
the
poor
girl
a
cursory
and
indifferent
glance
he
dropped
on
to
the
ground
'Well
he
began
still
gazing
away
swinging
his
leg
and
yawning
'have
you
been
here
long
The
girl
could
not
at
once
answer
'Yes
a
long
while
Viktor
Alexandritch
she
said
at
last
in
a
voice
hardly
audible
'Ah
He
took
off
his
cap
majestically
passed
his
hand
over
his
thick
stiffly
curled
hair
which
grew
almost
down
to
his
eyebrows
and
looking
round
him
with
dignity
he
carelessly
covered
his
precious
head
again
'And
I
quite
forgot
all
about
it
Besides
it
rained
He
yawned
again
'Lots
to
do
there
's
no
looking
after
everything
and
he's
always
scolding
We
set
off
to-morrow
'To-morrow
uttered
the
young
girl
And
she
fastened
her
startled
eyes
upon
him
'Yes
to-morrow
Come
come
come
please
he
added
in
a
tone
of
vexation
seeing
she
was
shaking
all
over
and
softly
bending
her
head
'please
Akulina
do
n't
cry
You
know
I
ca
n't
stand
that
And
he
wrinkled
up
his
snub
nose
'Else
I
'll
go
away
at
once
What
silliness
snivelling
'There
I
wo
n't
I
wo
n't
cried
Akulina
hurriedly
gulping
down
her
tears
with
an
effort
'You
are
starting
to-morrow
she
added
after
a
brief
silence
'when
will
God
grant
that
we
see
each
other
again
Viktor
Alexandritch
'We
shall
see
each
other
we
shall
see
each
other
If
not
next
year
then
later
The
master
wants
to
enter
the
service
in
Petersburg
I
fancy
he
went
on
pronouncing
his
words
with
careless
condescension
through
his
nose
'and
perhaps
we
shall
go
abroad
too
'You
will
forget
me
Viktor
Alexandritch
said
Akulina
mournfully
'No
why
so
I
wo
n't
forget
you
only
you
be
sensible
do
n't
be
a
fool
obey
your
father
And
I
wo
n't
forget
you
no-o
And
he
placidly
stretched
and
yawned
again
'Do
n't
forget
me
Viktor
Alexandritch
she
went
on
in
a
supplicating
voice
'I
think
none
could
love
you
as
I
do
I
have
given
you
everything
You
tell
me
to
obey
my
father
Viktor
Alexandritch
But
how
can
I
obey
my
father
'Why
not
He
uttered
these
words
as
it
were
from
his
stomach
lying
on
his
back
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
'But
how
can
I
Viktor
Alexandritch
you
know
yourself
She
broke
off
Viktor
played
with
his
steel
watch-chain
'You
're
not
a
fool
Akulina
he
said
at
last
'so
do
n't
talk
nonsense
I
desire
your
good
do
you
understand
me
To
be
sure
you
're
not
a
fool
not
altogether
a
mere
rustic
so
to
say
and
your
mother
too
was
n't
always
a
peasant
Still
you
've
no
education
so
you
ought
to
do
what
you
're
told
'But
it
's
fearful
Viktor
Alexandritch
'O-oh
that
's
nonsense
my
dear
a
queer
thing
to
be
afraid
of
What
have
you
got
there
he
added
moving
closer
to
her
'flowers
'Yes
Akulina
responded
dejectedly
'That
's
some
wild
tansy
I
picked
she
went
on
brightening
up
a
little
'it
's
good
for
calves
And
this
is
bud-marigold
against
the
king
's
evil
Look
what
an
exquisite
flower
I
've
never
seen
such
a
lovely
flower
before
These
are
forget-me-nots
and
that
's
mother-darling
And
these
I
picked
for
you
she
added
taking
from
under
a
yellow
tansy
a
small
bunch
of
blue
corn-flowers
tied
up
with
a
thin
blade
of
grass
Do
you
like
them
Viktor
languidly
held
out
his
hand
took
the
flowers
carelessly
sniffed
at
them
and
began
twirling
them
in
his
fingers
looking
upwards
Akulina
watched
him
In
her
mournful
eyes
there
was
such
tender
devotion
adoring
submission
and
love
She
was
afraid
of
him
and
did
not
dare
to
cry
and
was
saying
good-bye
to
him
and
admiring
him
for
the
last
time
while
he
lay
lolling
like
a
sultan
and
with
magnanimous
patience
and
condescension
put
up
with
her
adoration
I
must
own
I
glared
indignantly
at
his
red
face
on
which
under
the
affectation
of
scornful
indifference
one
could
discern
vanity
soothed
and
satisfied
Akulina
was
so
sweet
at
that
instant
her
whole
soul
was
confidingly
and
passionately
laid
bare
before
him
full
of
longing
and
caressing
tenderness
while
he
he
dropped
the
corn-flowers
on
the
grass
pulled
out
of
the
side
pocket
of
his
coat
a
round
eye-glass
set
in
a
brass
rim
and
began
sticking
it
in
his
eye
but
however
much
he
tried
to
hold
it
with
his
frowning
eyebrow
his
pursed-up
cheek
and
nose
the
eye-glass
kept
tumbling
out
and
falling
into
his
hand
'What
is
it
Akulina
asked
at
last
in
wonder
'An
eye-glass
he
answered
with
dignity
'What
for
'Why
to
see
better
'Show
me
Viktor
scowled
but
gave
her
the
glass
'Do
n't
break
it
look
out
'No
fear
I
wo
n't
break
it
She
put
it
to
her
eye
'I
see
nothing
she
said
innocently
'But
you
must
shut
your
eye
he
retorted
in
the
tones
of
a
displeased
teacher
She
shut
the
eye
before
which
she
held
the
glass
'Not
that
one
not
that
one
you
fool
the
other
cried
Viktor
and
he
took
away
his
eye-glass
without
allowing
her
to
correct
her
mistake
Akulina
flushed
a
little
gave
a
faint
laugh
and
turned
away
'It
's
clear
it
's
not
for
the
likes
of
us
she
said
'I
should
think
not
indeed
The
poor
girl
was
silent
and
gave
a
deep
sigh
'Ah
Viktor
Alexandritch
what
it
will
be
like
for
me
to
be
without
you
she
said
suddenly
Victor
rubbed
the
glass
on
the
lappet
of
his
coat
and
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
'Yes
yes
'he
said
at
last
'at
first
it
will
be
hard
for
you
certainly
He
patted
her
condescendingly
on
the
shoulder
she
softly
took
his
hand
from
her
shoulder
and
timidly
kissed
it
'There
there
you
're
a
good
girl
certainly
he
went
on
with
a
complacent
smile
'but
what
's
to
be
done
You
can
see
for
yourself
me
and
the
master
could
never
stay
on
here
it
will
soon
be
winter
now
and
winter
in
the
country
you
know
yourself
is
simply
disgusting
It
's
quite
another
thing
in
Petersburg
There
there
are
simply
such
wonders
as
a
silly
girl
like
you
could
never
fancy
in
your
dreams
Such
horses
and
streets
and
society
and
civilisation
simply
marvellous
Akulina
listened
with
devouring
attention
her
lips
slightly
parted
like
a
child
'But
what
's
the
use
he
added
turning
over
on
the
ground
'of
my
telling
you
all
this
Of
course
you
ca
n't
understand
it
'Why
so
Viktor
Alexandritch
I
understand
I
understood
everything
'My
eye
what
a
girl
it
is
Akulina
looked
down
'You
used
not
to
talk
to
me
like
that
once
Viktor
Alexandritch
she
said
not
lifting
her
eyes
'Once
once
My
goodness
he
remarked
as
though
in
indignation
They
both
were
silent
'It
's
time
I
was
going
said
Viktor
and
he
was
already
rising
on
to
his
elbow
'Wait
a
little
longer
Akulina
besought
him
in
a
supplicating
voice
'What
for
Why
I
've
said
good-bye
to
you
'Wait
a
little
repeated
Akulina
Viktor
lay
down
again
and
began
whistling
Akulina
never
took
her
eyes
off
him
I
could
see
that
she
was
gradually
being
overcome
by
emotion
her
lips
twitched
her
pale
cheeks
faintly
glowed
'Viktor
Alexandritch
she
began
at
last
in
a
broken
voice
'it
's
too
bad
of
you
it
is
too
bad
of
you
Viktor
Alexandritch
indeed
it
is
'What
's
too
bad
he
asked
frowning
and
he
slightly
raised
his
head
and
turned
it
towards
her
'It
's
too
bad
Viktor
Alexandritch
You
might
at
least
say
one
kind
word
to
me
at
parting
you
might
have
said
one
little
word
to
me
a
poor
luckless
forlorn
'But
what
am
I
to
say
to
you
'I
do
n't
know
you
know
that
best
Viktor
Alexandritch
Here
you
are
going
away
and
one
little
word
What
have
I
done
to
deserve
it
'You
're
such
a
queer
creature
What
can
I
do
'One
word
at
least
'There
she
keeps
on
at
the
same
thing
he
commented
with
annoyance
and
he
got
up
'Do
n't
be
angry
Viktor
Alexandritch
she
added
hurriedly
with
difficulty
suppressing
her
tears
I
'm
not
angry
only
you
're
silly
What
do
you
want
You
know
I
can't
marry
you
can
I
I
ca
n't
can
I
What
is
it
you
want
then
eh
He
thrust
his
face
forward
as
though
expecting
an
answer
and
spread
his
fingers
out
'I
want
nothing
nothing
she
answered
falteringly
and
she
ventured
to
hold
out
her
trembling
hands
to
him
'but
only
a
word
at
parting
And
her
tears
fell
in
a
torrent
'There
that
means
she
's
gone
off
into
crying
said
Viktor
coolly
pushing
down
his
cap
on
to
his
eyes
'I
want
nothing
she
went
on
sobbing
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
'but
what
is
there
before
me
in
my
family
what
is
there
before
me
what
will
happen
to
me
what
will
become
of
me
poor
wretch
They
will
marry
me
to
a
hateful
poor
forsaken
Poor
me
'Sing
away
sing
away
muttered
Viktor
in
an
undertone
fidgeting
with
impatience
as
he
stood
'And
he
might
say
one
word
one
word
He
might
say
Akulina
I
Sudden
heart-breaking
sobs
prevented
her
from
finishing
she
lay
with
her
face
in
the
grass
and
bitterly
bitterly
she
wept
Her
whole
body
shook
convulsively
her
neck
fairly
heaved
Her
long-suppressed
grief
broke
out
in
a
torrent
at
last
Viktor
stood
over
her
stood
a
moment
shrugged
his
shoulders
turned
away
and
strode
off
A
few
instants
passed
she
grew
calmer
raised
her
head
jumped
up
looked
round
and
wrung
her
hands
she
tried
to
run
after
him
but
her
legs
gave
way
under
her
she
fell
on
her
knees
I
could
not
refrain
from
rushing
up
to
her
but
almost
before
she
had
time
to
look
at
me
making
a
superhuman
effort
she
got
up
with
a
faint
shriek
and
vanished
behind
the
trees
leaving
her
flowers
scattered
on
the
ground
I
stood
a
minute
picked
up
the
bunch
of
cornflowers
and
went
out
of
the
wood
into
the
open
country
The
sun
had
sunk
low
in
the
pale
clear
sky
its
rays
too
seemed
to
have
grown
pale
and
chill
they
did
not
shine
they
were
diffused
in
an
unbroken
watery
light
It
was
within
half-an-hour
of
sunset
but
there
was
scarcely
any
of
the
glow
of
evening
A
gusty
wind
scurried
to
meet
me
across
the
yellow
parched
stubble
little
curled-up
leaves
scudding
hurriedly
before
it
flew
by
across
the
road
along
the
edge
of
the
copse
the
side
of
the
copse
facing
the
fields
like
a
wall
was
all
shaking
and
lighted
up
by
tiny
gleams
distinct
but
not
glowing
on
the
reddish
plants
the
blades
of
grass
the
straws
on
all
sides
were
sparkling
and
stirring
innumerable
threads
of
autumn
spider-webs
I
stopped
I
felt
sad
at
heart
under
the
bright
but
chill
smile
of
fading
nature
the
dismal
dread
of
coming
winter
seemed
to
steal
upon
me
High
overhead
flew
a
cautious
crow
heavily
and
sharply
cleaving
the
air
with
his
wings
he
turned
his
head
looked
sideways
at
me
flapped
his
wings
and
cawing
abruptly
vanished
behind
the
wood
a
great
flock
of
pigeons
flew
up
playfully
from
a
threshing
floor
and
suddenly
eddying
round
in
a
column
scattered
busily
about
the
country
Sure
sign
of
autumn
Some
one
came
driving
over
the
bare
hillside
his
empty
cart
rattling
loudly
I
turned
homewards
but
it
was
long
before
the
figure
of
poor
Akulina
faded
out
of
my
mind
and
her
cornflowers
long
since
withered
are
still
in
my
keeping
THE
HAMLET
OF
THE
SHTCHIGRI
DISTRICT
On
one
of
my
excursions
I
received
an
invitation
to
dine
at
the
house
of
a
rich
landowner
and
sportsman
Alexandr
Mihalitch
G
His
property
was
four
miles
from
the
small
village
where
I
was
staying
at
the
time
I
put
on
a
frock-coat
an
article
without
which
I
advise
no
one
to
travel
even
on
