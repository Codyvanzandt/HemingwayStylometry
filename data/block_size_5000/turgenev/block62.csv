Marya
Dmitrievna
expressed
a
desire
to
return
home
and
the
little
girls
were
with
difficulty
torn
away
from
the
pond
and
made
ready
Lavretsky
declared
that
he
would
escort
his
guests
half-way
and
ordered
his
horse
to
be
saddled
As
he
was
handing
Marya
Dmitrievna
into
the
coach
he
bethought
himself
of
Lemm
but
the
old
man
could
nowhere
be
found
He
had
disappeared
directly
after
the
angling
was
over
Anton
with
an
energy
remarkable
for
his
years
slammed
the
doors
and
called
sharply
Go
on
coachman
the
coach
started
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
Lisa
were
seated
in
the
back
seat
the
children
and
their
maid
in
the
front
The
evening
was
warm
and
still
and
the
windows
were
open
on
both
sides
Lavretsky
trotted
near
the
coach
on
the
side
of
Lisa
with
his
arm
leaning
on
the
door
he
had
thrown
the
reigns
on
the
neck
of
his
smoothly-pacing
horse
and
now
and
then
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
young
girl
The
glow
of
sunset
was
disappearing
night
came
on
but
the
air
seemed
to
grow
even
warmer
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
soon
slumbering
the
little
girls
and
the
maid
fell
asleep
also
The
coach
rolled
swiftly
and
smoothly
along
Lisa
was
bending
forward
she
felt
happy
the
rising
moon
lighted
up
her
face
the
fragrant
night
on
breeze
breathed
on
her
eyes
and
cheeks
Her
hand
rested
on
the
coach
door
near
Lavretsky
s
hand
And
he
was
happy
borne
along
in
the
still
warmth
of
the
night
never
taking
his
eyes
off
the
good
young
face
listening
to
the
young
voice
that
was
melodious
even
in
a
whisper
as
it
spoke
of
simple
good
things
he
did
not
even
notice
that
he
had
gone
more
than
half-way
He
did
not
want
to
wake
Marya
Dmitrievna
he
lightly
pressed
Lisa
s
hand
and
said
I
think
we
are
friends
now
aren
t
we
She
nodded
he
stopped
his
horse
and
the
coach
rolled
away
lightly
swaying
and
oscillating
up
and
down
Lavretsky
turned
homeward
at
a
walking
pace
The
witchery
of
the
summer
night
enfolded
him
all
around
him
seemed
suddenly
so
strange
and
at
the
same
time
so
long
known
so
sweetly
familiar
Everywhere
near
and
afar
and
one
could
see
in
to
the
far
distance
though
the
eye
could
not
make
out
clearly
much
of
what
was
seen
all
was
at
peace
youthful
blossoming
life
seemed
expressed
in
this
deep
peace
Lavretsky
s
horse
stepped
out
bravely
swaying
evenly
to
right
and
left
its
great
black
shadow
moved
along
beside
it
There
was
something
strangely
sweet
in
the
tramp
of
its
hoofs
a
strange
charm
in
the
ringing
cry
of
the
quails
The
stars
were
lost
in
a
bright
mist
the
moon
not
yet
at
the
full
shone
with
steady
brilliance
its
light
was
shot
in
an
azure
stream
over
the
sky
and
fell
in
patches
of
smoky
gold
on
the
thin
clouds
as
they
drifted
near
The
freshness
of
the
air
drew
a
slight
moisture
into
the
eyes
sweetly
folded
all
the
limbs
and
flowed
freely
into
the
lungs
Lavretsky
rejoiced
in
it
and
was
glad
at
his
own
rejoicing
Come
we
are
still
alive
he
thought
we
have
not
been
altogether
destroyed
by
he
did
not
say
by
whom
or
by
what
Then
he
fell
to
thinking
of
Lisa
that
she
could
hardly
love
Panshin
that
if
he
had
met
her
under
different
circumstances
God
knows
what
might
have
come
of
it
that
he
undertook
Lemm
though
Lisa
had
no
words
of
her
own
but
that
he
thought
was
not
true
she
had
words
of
her
own
Don
t
speak
light
of
that
came
back
to
Lavretsky
s
mind
He
rode
a
long
way
with
his
head
bent
in
thought
then
drawing
himself
up
he
slowly
repeated
aloud
And
I
have
burnt
all
I
adored
And
now
I
adore
all
that
I
burnt
Then
he
gave
his
horse
a
switch
with
the
whip
and
galloped
all
the
way
home
Dismounting
from
his
horse
he
looked
round
for
the
last
time
with
an
involuntary
smile
of
gratitude
Night
still
kindly
night
stretched
over
hills
and
valleys
from
afar
out
of
its
fragrant
depths
God
knows
whence
whether
from
the
heavens
or
the
earth
rose
a
soft
gentle
warmth
Lavretsky
sent
a
last
greeting
to
Lisa
and
ran
up
the
steps
The
next
day
passed
rather
dully
Rain
was
falling
from
early
morning
Lemm
wore
a
scowl
and
kept
more
and
more
tightly
compressing
his
lips
as
though
he
had
taken
an
oath
never
to
open
them
again
When
he
went
to
his
room
Lavretsky
took
up
to
bed
with
him
a
whole
bundle
of
French
newspapers
which
had
been
lying
for
more
than
fortnight
on
his
table
unopened
He
began
indifferently
to
tear
open
the
wrappings
and
glanced
hastily
over
the
columns
of
the
newspapers
in
which
however
there
was
nothing
new
He
was
just
about
to
throw
them
down
and
all
at
once
he
leaped
out
of
bed
as
if
he
had
been
stung
In
an
article
in
one
of
the
papers
M
Jules
with
whom
we
are
already
familiar
communicated
to
his
readers
a
mournful
intelligence
that
charming
fascinating
Moscow
lady
he
wrote
one
of
the
queens
of
fashion
who
adorned
Parisian
salons
Madame
de
Lavretsky
had
died
almost
suddenly
and
this
intelligence
unhappily
only
too
well-founded
had
only
just
reached
him
M
Jules
He
was
so
he
continued
he
might
say
a
friend
of
the
deceased
Lavretsky
dressed
went
out
into
the
garden
and
till
morning
he
walked
up
and
down
the
same
path
The
next
morning
over
their
tea
Lemm
asked
Lavretsky
to
let
him
have
the
horses
to
return
to
town
It
s
time
for
me
to
set
to
work
that
is
to
my
lessons
observed
the
old
man
Besides
I
am
only
wasting
time
here
Lavretsky
did
not
reply
at
once
he
seemed
abstracted
Very
good
he
said
at
last
I
will
come
with
you
myself
Unaided
by
the
servants
Lemm
groaning
and
wrathful
packed
his
small
box
and
tore
up
and
burnt
a
few
sheets
of
music-paper
The
horses
were
harnessed
As
he
came
out
of
his
own
room
Lavretsky
put
the
paper
he
had
read
last
night
in
his
pocket
During
the
whole
course
of
the
journey
both
Lemm
and
Lavretsky
spoke
little
to
one
another
each
was
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
and
each
was
glad
not
to
be
disturbed
by
the
other
and
they
parted
rather
coolly
which
is
often
the
way
however
with
friends
in
Russia
Lavretsky
conducted
the
old
man
to
his
little
house
the
latter
got
out
took
his
trunk
and
without
holding
out
his
hand
to
his
friend
he
was
holding
his
trunk
in
both
arms
before
his
breast
without
even
looking
at
him
he
said
to
him
in
Russian
good-bye
Good-bye
repeated
Lavretsky
and
bade
the
coachman
drive
to
his
lodging
He
had
taken
rooms
in
the
town
of
O
After
writing
a
few
letters
and
hastily
dining
Lavretsky
went
to
the
Kalitins
In
their
drawing-room
he
found
only
Panshin
who
informed
him
that
Marya
Dmitrievna
would
be
in
directly
and
at
once
with
charming
cordiality
entered
into
conversation
with
him
Until
that
day
Panshin
had
always
treated
Lavretsky
not
exactly
haughtily
but
at
least
condescendingly
but
Lisa
in
describing
her
expedition
of
the
previous
day
to
Panshin
had
spoken
of
Lavretsky
as
an
excellent
and
clever
man
that
was
enough
he
felt
bound
to
make
a
conquest
of
an
excellent
man
Panshin
began
with
compliments
to
Lavretsky
with
a
description
of
the
rapture
in
which
according
to
him
the
whole
family
of
Marya
Dmitrievna
spoke
of
Vassilyevskoe
and
then
according
to
his
custom
passing
neatly
to
himself
began
to
talk
about
his
pursuits
and
his
views
on
life
the
world
and
government
service
uttered
a
sentence
or
two
upon
the
future
of
Russia
and
the
duty
of
rulers
to
keep
a
strict
hand
over
the
country
and
at
this
point
laughed
light-heartedly
at
his
own
expense
and
added
that
among
other
things
he
had
been
intrusted
in
Petersburg
with
the
duty
de
poplariser
l
idee
du
cadastre
He
spoke
somewhat
at
length
passing
over
all
difficulties
with
careless
self-confidence
and
playing
with
the
weightiest
administrative
and
political
questions
as
a
juggler
plays
with
balls
The
expressions
That
s
what
I
would
do
if
I
were
in
the
government
you
as
a
man
of
intelligence
will
agree
with
me
at
once
were
constantly
on
his
lips
Lavretsky
listened
coldly
to
Panshin
s
chatter
he
did
not
like
this
handsome
clever
easily-elegant
young
man
with
his
bright
smile
affable
voice
and
inquisitive
eyes
Panshin
with
the
quick
insight
into
the
feelings
of
others
which
was
peculiar
to
him
soon
guessed
that
he
was
not
giving
his
companion
any
special
satisfaction
and
made
a
plausible
excuse
to
go
away
inwardly
deciding
that
Lavretsky
might
be
an
excellent
man
but
he
was
unattractive
aigri
and
en
somme
rather
absurd
Marya
Dmitrievna
made
her
appearance
escorted
by
Gedeonovsky
then
Marfa
Timofyevna
and
Lisa
came
in
and
after
them
the
other
members
of
the
household
and
then
the
musical
amateur
Madame
Byelenitsin
arrived
a
little
thinnish
lady
with
a
languid
pretty
almost
childish
little
face
wearing
a
rusting
dress
a
striped
fan
and
heavy
gold
bracelets
Her
husband
was
with
her
a
fat
red-faced
man
with
large
hands
and
feet
white
eye-lashes
and
an
immovable
smile
on
his
thick
lips
his
wife
never
spoke
to
him
in
company
but
at
home
in
moments
of
tenderness
she
used
to
call
him
her
little
sucking-pig
Panshin
returned
the
rooms
were
very
full
of
people
and
noise
Such
a
crowd
was
not
to
Lavretsky
s
taste
and
he
was
particularly
irritated
by
Madame
Byelenitsin
who
kept
staring
at
him
through
her
eye-glasses
He
would
have
gone
away
at
once
but
for
Lisa
he
wanted
to
say
a
few
words
to
her
alone
but
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
get
a
favourable
opportunity
and
had
to
content
himself
with
following
her
in
secret
delight
with
his
eyes
never
had
her
face
seemed
sweeter
and
more
noble
to
him
She
gained
much
from
being
near
Madame
Byelenitsin
The
latter
was
for
ever
fidgeting
in
her
chair
shrugging
her
narrow
shoulders
giving
little
girlish
giggles
and
screwing
up
her
eyes
and
then
opening
them
wide
Lisa
sat
quietly
looked
directly
at
every
one
and
did
not
laugh
at
all
Madame
Kalitin
sat
down
to
a
game
of
cards
with
Marfa
Timofyevna
Madame
Byelenitsin
and
Gedeonovsky
who
played
very
slowly
and
constantly
made
mistakes
frowning
and
wiping
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
Panshin
assumed
a
melancholy
air
and
expressed
himself
in
brief
pregnant
and
gloomy
phrases
played
the
part
in
fact
of
the
unappreciated
genius
but
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
Madame
Byelenitsin
who
was
very
coquettish
with
him
he
would
not
consent
to
sing
his
son
he
felt
Lavretsky
s
presence
a
constraint
Fedor
Ivanitch
also
spoke
little
the
peculiar
expression
of
his
face
struck
Lisa
directly
he
came
into
the
room
she
felt
at
once
that
he
had
something
to
tell
her
and
though
she
could
not
herself
have
said
why
she
was
afraid
to
question
him
At
last
as
she
was
going
into
the
next
room
to
pour
out
tea
she
involuntarily
turned
her
head
in
his
direction
He
at
once
went
after
her
What
is
the
matter
she
said
setting
the
teapot
on
the
samovar
Why
have
you
noticed
anything
he
asked
You
are
not
the
same
to-day
as
I
have
always
seen
you
before
Lavretsky
bent
over
the
table
I
wanted
he
began
to
tell
you
a
piece
of
news
but
now
it
is
impossible
However
you
can
read
what
is
marked
with
pencil
in
that
article
he
added
handing
her
the
paper
he
had
brought
with
him
Let
me
ask
you
to
keep
it
a
secret
I
will
come
to-morrow
morning
Lisa
was
greatly
bewildered
Panshin
appeared
in
the
doorway
She
put
the
newspaper
in
her
pocket
Have
you
read
Obermann
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
Panshin
asked
her
pensively
Lisa
made
him
a
reply
in
passing
and
went
out
of
the
room
and
up-stairs
Lavretsky
went
back
to
the
drawing-room
and
drew
near
the
card-table
Marfa
Timofyevna
flinging
back
the
ribbons
of
her
cap
and
flushing
with
annoyance
began
to
complain
of
her
partner
Gedeonovsky
who
in
her
words
could
not
play
a
bit
Car-playing
you
see
she
said
is
not
so
easy
as
talking
scandal
The
latter
continued
to
blink
and
wipe
his
face
Lisa
came
into
the
drawing-room
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
Lavretsky
looked
at
her
she
looked
at
him
and
both
the
felt
the
position
insufferable
He
read
perplexity
and
a
kind
of
secret
reproachfulness
in
her
face
He
could
not
talk
to
her
as
he
would
have
liked
to
do
to
remain
in
the
same
room
with
her
a
guest
among
other
guests
was
too
painful
he
decided
to
go
away
As
he
took
leave
of
her
he
managed
to
repeat
that
he
would
come
to-morrow
and
added
that
he
trusted
in
her
friendship
Come
she
answered
with
the
same
perplexity
on
her
face
Panshin
brightened
up
at
Lavretsky
s
departure
he
began
to
give
advice
to
Gedeonovsky
paid
ironical
attentions
to
Madame
Byelenitsin
and
at
last
sang
his
song
But
with
Lisa
he
still
spoke
and
looked
as
before
impressively
and
rather
mournfully
Again
Lavretsky
did
not
sleep
all
night
He
was
not
sad
he
was
not
agitated
he
was
quite
clam
but
he
could
not
sleep
He
did
not
even
remember
the
past
he
simply
looked
at
his
life
his
heart
beat
slowly
and
evenly
the
hours
glided
by
he
did
not
even
think
of
sleep
Only
at
times
the
thought
flashed
through
his
brain
But
it
is
not
true
it
is
all
nonsense
and
he
stood
still
bowed
his
head
and
again
began
to
ponder
on
the
life
before
him
Marya
Dmitrievna
did
not
give
Lavretsky
an
over-cordial
welcome
when
he
made
his
appearance
the
following
day
Upon
my
word
he
s
always
in
and
out
she
thought
She
did
not
much
care
for
him
and
Panshin
under
whose
influence
she
was
had
been
very
artful
and
disparaging
in
his
praises
of
him
the
evening
before
And
as
she
did
not
regard
him
as
a
visitor
and
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
entertain
a
relation
almost
one
of
the
family
it
came
to
pass
that
in
less
than
half-an
hour
s
time
he
found
himself
walking
in
an
avenue
in
the
grounds
with
Lisa
Lenotchka
and
Shurotchka
were
running
about
a
few
paces
from
them
in
the
flower-garden
Lisa
was
as
calm
as
usual
but
more
than
usually
pale
She
took
out
of
her
pocket
and
held
out
to
Lavretsky
the
sheet
of
the
newspaper
folded
up
small
That
is
terrible
she
said
Lavretsky
made
no
reply
But
perhaps
it
is
not
true
though
added
Lisa
That
is
why
I
asked
you
not
to
speak
of
it
to
any
one
Lisa
walked
on
a
little
Tell
me
she
began
you
are
not
grieved
not
at
all
I
do
not
know
myself
what
I
feel
replied
Lavretsky
But
you
loved
her
once
Yes
Very
much
Yes
So
you
are
not
grieved
at
her
death
She
was
dead
to
me
long
ago
It
is
sinful
to
say
that
Do
not
be
angry
with
me
You
call
me
your
friend
a
friend
may
say
everything
To
me
it
is
really
terrible
Yesterday
there
was
an
evil
look
in
your
face
Do
you
remember
not
long
ago
how
you
abused
her
and
she
perhaps
at
that
very
time
was
dead
It
is
terrible
It
has
been
sent
to
you
as
a
punishment
Lavretsky
smiled
bitterly
Do
you
think
so
At
least
I
am
now
free
Lisa
gave
a
slight
shudder
Stop
do
not
talk
like
that
Of
what
use
is
your
freedom
to
you
You
ought
not
to
be
thinking
of
that
now
but
of
forgiveness
I
forgave
her
long
ago
Lavretsky
interposed
with
a
gesture
of
the
hand
No
that
is
not
it
replied
Lisa
flushing
You
did
not
understand
me
You
ought
to
be
seeking
to
be
forgiven
To
be
forgiven
by
whom
By
whom
God
Who
can
forgive
us
but
God
Lavretsky
seized
her
hand
Ah
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
believe
me
he
cried
I
have
been
punished
enough
as
it
is
I
have
expiated
everything
already
believe
me
That
you
can
not
know
Lisa
murmured
in
an
undertone
You
have
forgotten
not
long
ago
when
you
were
talking
to
me
you
were
not
ready
to
forgive
her
She
walked
in
silence
along
the
avenue
And
what
about
your
daughter
Lisa
asked
suddenly
stopping
short
Lavretsky
started
Oh
don
t
be
uneasy
I
have
already
sent
letters
in
all
directions
The
future
of
my
daughter
as
you
call
as
you
say
is
assured
Do
not
be
uneasy
Lisa
smiled
mournfully
But
you
are
right
continued
Lavretsky
what
can
I
do
with
my
freedom
What
good
is
it
to
me
When
did
you
get
that
paper
said
Lisa
without
replying
to
his
question
The
day
after
your
visit
And
is
it
possible
you
did
not
even
shed
tears
No
I
was
thunderstruck
but
where
were
tears
to
come
from
Should
I
weep
over
the
past
but
it
is
utterly
extinct
for
me
Her
very
fault
did
not
destroy
my
happiness
but
only
showed
me
that
it
had
never
been
at
all
What
is
there
to
weep
over
now
Though
indeed
who
knows
I
might
perhaps
have
been
more
grieved
if
I
had
got
this
news
a
fortnight
sooner
A
fortnight
repeated
Lisa
But
what
has
happened
then
in
the
last
fortnight
Lavretsky
made
no
answer
and
suddenly
Lisa
flushed
even
more
than
before
Yes
yes
you
guess
why
Lavretsky
cried
suddenly
in
the
course
of
this
fortnight
I
have
come
to
know
the
value
of
a
pure
woman
s
heart
and
my
past
seems
further
from
me
than
ever
Lisa
was
confused
and
went
gently
into
the
flower-garden
towards
Lenotchka
and
Shurotchka
But
I
am
glad
I
showed
you
that
newspaper
said
Lavretsky
walking
after
her
already
I
have
grown
used
to
hiding
nothing
from
you
and
I
hope
you
will
repay
me
with
the
same
confidence
Do
you
expect
it
said
Lisa
standing
still
In
that
case
I
ought
but
no
It
is
impossible
What
is
it
Tell
me
tell
me
Really
I
believe
I
ought
not
after
all
though
added
Lisa
turning
to
Lavretsky
with
a
smile
what
s
the
good
of
half
confidence
Do
you
know
I
received
a
letter
today
From
Panshin
Yes
How
did
you
know
He
asks
for
your
hand
Yes
replied
Lisa
looking
Lavretsky
straight
in
the
face
with
a
serious
expression
Lavretsky
on
his
side
looked
seriously
at
Lisa
Well
and
what
answer
have
you
given
him
he
managed
to
say
at
last
I
don
t
know
what
answer
to
give
replied
Lisa
letting
her
clasped
hands
fall
How
is
that
Do
you
love
him
then
Yes
I
like
him
he
seems
a
nice
man
You
said
the
very
same
thing
and
in
the
very
same
words
three
days
ago
I
want
to
know
do
you
love
him
with
that
intense
passionate
feeling
which
we
usually
call
love
As
you
understand
it
no
You
re
not
in
love
with
him
No
But
is
that
necessary
What
do
you
mean
Mamma
likes
him
continued
Lisa
he
is
kind
I
have
nothing
against
him
You
hesitate
however
Yes
and
perhaps
you
your
words
are
the
cause
of
it
Do
you
remember
what
you
said
three
days
ago
But
that
is
weakness
O
my
child
cried
Lavretsky
suddenly
and
his
voice
was
shaking
don
t
cheat
yourself
with
sophistries
don
t
call
weakness
the
cry
of
your
heart
which
is
not
ready
to
give
itself
without
love
Do
not
take
on
yourself
such
a
fearful
responsibility
to
this
man
whom
you
don
t
love
though
you
are
ready
to
belong
to
him
I
m
obeying
I
take
nothing
on
myself
Lisa
was
murmuring
Obey
your
heart
only
that
will
tell
you
the
truth
Lavretsky
interrupted
her
Experience
prudence
all
that
is
dust
and
ashes
Do
not
deprive
yourself
of
the
best
of
the
sole
happiness
on
earth
Do
you
say
that
Fedor
Ivanitch
You
yourself
married
for
love
and
were
you
happy
Lavretsky
threw
up
his
arms
Ah
don
t
talk
about
me
You
can
t
even
understand
all
that
a
young
inexperienced
badly
brought-up
boy
may
mistake
for
love
Indeed
though
after
all
why
should
I
be
unfair
to
myself
I
told
you
just
now
that
I
had
not
had
happiness
No
I
was
not
happy
It
seems
to
me
Fedor
Ivanitch
Lisa
murmured
in
a
low
voice
when
she
did
not
agree
with
the
person
whom
she
was
talking
she
always
dropped
her
voice
and
now
too
she
was
deeply
moved
happiness
on
earth
does
not
depend
on
ourselves
On
ourselves
ourselves
believe
me
he
seized
both
her
hands
Lisa
grew
pale
and
almost
with
terror
but
still
steadfastly
looked
at
him
if
only
we
do
not
ruin
our
lives
For
some
people
marriage
for
love
may
be
unhappiness
but
not
for
you
with
your
calm
temperament
and
your
clear
soul
I
beseech
you
do
not
marry
without
love
from
a
sense
of
duty
self-sacrifice
or
anything
That
is
infidelity
that
is
mercenary
and
worse
still
Believe
me
I
have
the
right
to
say
so
I
have
paid
dearly
for
the
right
And
if
your
God
At
that
instant
Lavretsky
noticed
that
Lenotchka
and
Shurotchka
were
standing
near
Lisa
and
staring
in
dumb
amazement
at
him
He
dropped
Lisa
s
hands
saying
hurriedly
I
beg
your
pardon
and
turned
away
towards
the
house
One
thing
only
I
beg
of
you
he
added
returning
again
to
Lisa
don
t
decide
at
once
wait
a
little
think
of
what
I
have
said
to
you
Even
if
you
don
t
believe
me
even
if
you
did
decide
on
a
marriage
of
prudence
even
in
that
case
you
mustn
t
marry
Panshin
He
can
t
be
your
husband
You
will
promise
me
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
won
t
you
Lisa
tried
to
answer
Lavretsky
but
she
did
not
utter
a
word
not
because
she
was
resolved
to
be
in
a
hurry
but
because
her
heart
was
beating
too
violently
and
a
feeling
akin
to
terror
stopped
her
breath
As
he
was
coming
away
from
the
Kalitins
Lavretsky
met
Panshin
they
bowed
coldly
to
one
another
Lavretsky
went
to
his
lodgings
and
locked
himself
in
He
was
experiencing
emotions
such
as
he
had
hardly
ever
experienced
before
How
long
ago
was
it
since
he
had
thought
himself
in
a
state
of
peaceful
petrifaction
How
long
was
it
since
he
had
felt
as
he
had
expressed
himself
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
river
What
had
changed
his
position
What
had
brought
him
out
of
his
solitude
The
most
ordinary
inevitable
though
always
unexpected
event
death
Yes
but
he
was
not
thinking
so
much
of
his
wife
s
death
and
his
own
freedom
as
of
this
question
what
answer
would
Lisa
give
Panshin
He
felt
that
in
the
course
of
the
last
three
days
he
had
come
to
look
at
her
with
different
eyes
he
remembered
how
after
returning
home
when
he
thought
of
her
in
the
silence
of
the
night
he
had
said
to
himself
if
only
That
if
only
in
which
he
had
referred
to
the
past
to
the
impossible
had
come
to
pass
though
not
as
he
had
imagined
it
but
his
freedom
alone
was
little
She
will
obey
her
mother
he
thought
she
will
marry
Panshin
but
even
if
she
refuses
him
won
t
it
be
just
the
same
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
Going
up
to
the
looking-glass
he
minutely
scrutinised
his
own
face
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
The
day
passed
quickly
by
in
these
meditations
and
evening
came
Lavretsky
went
to
the
Kalitins
He
walked
quickly
but
his
pace
slackened
as
he
drew
near
the
house
Before
the
steps
was
standing
Panshin
s
light
carriage
Come
though
Lavretsky
I
will
not
be
an
egoist
and
he
went
into
the
house
He
met
with
no
one
within-doors
and
there
was
no
sound
in
the
drawing-room
he
opened
the
door
and
saw
Marya
Dmitrievna
playing
picquet
with
Panshin
Panshin
bowed
to
him
without
speaking
but
the
lady
of
the
house
cried
Well
this
is
unexpected
and
slightly
frowned
Lavretsky
sat
down
near
her
and
began
to
look
at
her
cards
Do
you
know
how
to
play
picquet
she
asked
him
with
a
kind
of
hidden
vexation
and
then
declared
that
she
had
thrown
away
a
wrong
card
Panshin
counted
ninety
and
began
calmly
and
urbanely
taking
tricks
with
a
severe
and
dignified
expression
of
face
So
it
befits
diplomatists
to
play
this
was
no
doubt
how
he
played
in
Petersburg
with
some
influential
dignitary
whom
he
wished
to
impress
with
a
favourable
opinion
of
his
solidity
and
maturity
A
hundred
and
one
a
hundred
and
two
hearts
a
hundred
and
three
sounded
his
voice
in
measured
tones
and
Lavretsky
could
not
decide
whether
it
had
a
ring
of
reproach
or
of
self-satisfaction
Can
I
see
Marfa
Timofyevna
he
inquired
observing
that
Panshin
was
setting
to
work
to
shuffle
the
cards
with
still
more
dignity
There
was
not
a
trace
of
the
artist
to
be
detected
in
him
now
I
think
you
can
She
is
at
home
up-stairs
replied
Marya
Dmitrievna
inquire
for
her
Lavretsky
went
up-stairs
He
found
Marfa
Timofyevna
also
at
cards
she
was
playing
old
maid
with
Nastasya
Karpovna
Roska
barked
at
him
but
both
the
old
ladies
welcomed
him
cordially
Marfa
Timofyevna
especially
seemed
in
excellent
spirits
Ah
Fedya
she
began
pray
sit
down
my
dear
We
are
just
finishing
our
game
Would
you
like
some
preserve
Shurotchka
bring
him
a
pot
of
strawberry
You
don
t
want
any
Well
sit
there
only
you
mustn
t
smoke
I
can
t
bear
your
tobacco
and
it
makes
Matross
sneeze
Lavretsky
made
haste
to
assure
her
that
he
had
not
the
least
desire
to
smoke
Have
you
been
down-stairs
the
old
lady
continued
Whom
did
you
see
there
Is
Panshin
still
on
view
Did
you
see
Lisa
No
She
was
meaning
to
come
up
here
And
here
she
is
speak
of
angels
Lisa
came
into
the
room
and
she
flushed
when
she
saw
Lavretsky
I
came
in
for
a
minute
Marfa
Timofyevna
she
was
beginning
Why
for
a
minute
interposed
the
old
lady
Why
are
you
always
in
such
a
hurry
you
young
people
You
see
I
have
a
visitor
talk
to
him
a
little
and
entertain
him
Lisa
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
she
raised
her
eyes
to
Lavretsky
and
felt
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
let
him
know
how
her
interview
with
Panshin
had
ended
But
how
was
she
to
do
it
She
felt
both
awkward
and
ashamed
She
had
not
long
known
him
this
man
who
rarely
went
to
church
and
took
his
wife
s
death
so
calmly
and
here
was
she
confiding
al
her
secrets
to
him
It
was
true
he
took
an
interest
in
her
she
herself
trusted
him
and
felt
drawn
to
him
but
all
the
same
she
was
ashamed
as
though
a
stranger
had
been
into
her
pure
maiden
bower
Marfa
Timofyevna
came
to
her
assistance
Well
if
you
won
t
entertain
him
said
Marfa
Timofyevna
who
will
poor
fellow
I
am
too
old
for
him
he
is
too
clever
for
me
and
for
Nastasya
Karpovna
he
s
too
old
it
s
only
the
quite
young
men
she
will
look
at
How
can
I
entertain
Fedor
Ivanitch
said
Lisa
If
he
likes
had
I
not
better
play
him
something
on
the
piano
she
added
irresolutely
Capital
you
re
my
clever
girl
rejoined
Marfa
Timofyevna
Step
down-stairs
my
dears
when
you
have
finished
come
back
I
have
been
made
old
maid
I
don
t
like
it
I
want
to
have
my
revenge
Lisa
got
up
Lavretsky
went
after
her
As
she
went
down
the
staircase
Lisa
stopped
They
say
truly
she
began
that
people
s
hearts
are
full
of
contradictions
Your
example
ought
to
frighten
me
to
make
me
distrust
marriage
for
love
but
I
You
have
refused
him
interrupted
Lavretsky
No
but
I
have
not
consented
either
I
told
him
everything
everything
I
felt
and
asked
him
to
wait
a
little
Are
you
pleased
with
me
she
added
with
a
swift
smile
and
with
a
light
touch
of
her
hand
on
the
banister
she
ran
down
the
stairs
What
shall
I
play
to
you
she
asked
opening
the
piano
What
you
like
answered
Lavretsky
as
he
sat
down
so
that
he
could
look
at
her
Lisa
began
to
play
and
for
a
long
while
she
did
not
lift
her
eyes
from
her
fingers
She
glanced
at
last
at
Lavretsky
and
stopped
short
his
face
seemed
strange
and
beautiful
to
her
What
is
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
Nothing
he
replied
I
m
very
happy
I
m
glad
of
you
I
m
glad
to
see
you
go
on
It
seems
to
me
said
Lisa
a
few
moments
later
that
if
he
had
really
loved
me
he
would
not
have
written
that
letter
he
must
have
felt
that
I
could
not
give
him
an
answer
now
That
is
of
no
consequence
observed
Lavretsky
what
is
important
is
that
you
don
t
love
him
Stop
how
can
we
talk
like
this
I
keep
thinking
of
you
dead
wife
and
you
frighten
me
Don
t
you
think
Voldemar
that
Liseta
plays
charmingly
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
saying
at
that
moment
to
Panshin
Yes
answered
Panshin
very
charmingly
Marya
Dmitrievna
looked
tenderly
at
her
young
partner
but
the
latter
assumed
a
still
more
important
and
care-worn
air
and
called
fourteen
kings
Lavretsky
was
not
a
young
man
he
could
not
long
delude
himself
