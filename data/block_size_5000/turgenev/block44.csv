Pyotr
Vassilyitch
took
advantage
of
it
to
introduce
Boris
An
dreyitch
Monsieur
and
Madame
Tihoduev
sim
ultaneously
declared
that
they
were
very
glad
to
meet
their
new
acquaintance
then
Kalimon
Ivanitch
introduced
his
daughters
calhng
them
Polinka
and
Eminka
There
were
two
other
persons
of
the
female
sex
no
longer
young
in
the
room
one
in
a
cap
and
the
other
in
a
dark
kerchief
but
Kalimon
Ivanitch
did
not
think
fit
to
introduce
Boris
Andreyitch
to
them
Kalimon
Ivanitch
was
a
tall
stoutly
built
grey-headed
man
of
about
five
and
fifty
his
face
expressed
nothing
in
particular
his
fea
tures
were
plain
and
heavy
with
a
stamp
of
indifference
good
nature
and
indolence
upon
them
His
wife
a
thin
little
woman
with
a
little
face
that
looked
rather
the
worse
for
wear
and
a
front
of
reddish
hair
under
a
high
cap
seemed
in
continual
agitation
traces
of
bygone
affectation
could
be
detected
in
her
One
of
the
daughters
Pelageya
a
girl
with
dark
hair
and
a
swarthy
skit
looked
up
from
under
her
brows
and
was
wildly
shy
on
the
other
hand
Emerentsiya
a
fair-haired
plump
girl
witli
round
red
cheeks
with
a
little
pursed-up
mouth
a
turned-up
nose
and
sugary
eyes
fairly
thrust
herself
forward
It
was
evident
that
the
duty
of
entertaining
visitors
was
her
responsibility
and
did
not
weigh
upon
her
in
the
least
Both
sisters
wore
white
dresses
with
Hght-blue
rib
bons
that
fluttered
with
the
sHghtest
movement
Bhie
suited
Emerentsiya
but
did
not
suit
Po
linka
indeed
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
anything
to
suit
her
though
she
could
not
have
been
called
ugly
The
visitors
were
seated
and
the
usual
ques
tions
were
put
to
them
pronounced
with
that
mawkish
and
affected
expression
of
face
seen
in
the
most
well-bred
persons
during
the
first
moments
of
conversation
with
new
acquaint
ances
the
guests
replied
in
the
same
manner
All
this
had
a
somewhat
oppressive
effect
Kali
mon
Ivanitch
who
was
not
naturally
very
re
sourceful
asked
Boris
Andreyitch
whether
he
had
been
living
long
in
our
parts
though
Boris
Andreyitch
had
only
just
replied
to
the
same
question
from
Pelageya
Ivanovna
The
lady
in
a
very
soft
voice
the
voice
always
used
before
visitors
on
the
day
of
their
first
visit
reproached
her
husband
for
his
absent-minded
ness
Kalimon
Ivanitch
was
rather
confused
and
blew
his
nose
loudly
with
a
check
pocket-hand
The
Two
friends
kerchief
This
sound
excited
one
of
the
sheep
dogs
and
it
began
barking
but
Emerentsiya
was
on
the
spot
at
once
and
soothed
it
back
into
silence
The
same
young
lady
contrived
to
render
another
service
to
her
somewhat
help
less
parents
she
enlivened
the
conversation
by
modestly
but
resolutely
sitting
down
beside
Boris
Andreyitch
and
with
the
most
honeyed
air
asking
him
questions
which
though
trivial
were
agreeable
and
calculated
to
elicit
amusing
answers
Things
were
soon
going
swimmingly
a
lively
general
conversation
sprang
up
in
which
all
but
Polinka
took
part
She
looked
obsti
nately
at
the
floor
while
Emerentsiya
actually
laughed
gracefully
lifting
up
one
hand
and
at
the
same
time
her
manner
seemed
to
be
saying
Look
look
how
well-bred
and
amiable
I
am
and
what
charming
playfulness
and
friendli
ness
I
have
with
everyone
She
seemed
even
to
be
lisping
out
of
good
nature
She
laughed
with
lingering
dulcet
notes
though
Boris
An
dreyitch
did
not
at
first
say
anything
particularly
funny
She
laughed
still
more
when
Boris
Andreyitch
encouraged
by
the
success
of
his
words
began
being
really
witty
and
mali
cious
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
laughed
too
Vya
zovnin
observed
among
other
things
that
he
was
passionately
fond
of
music
And
I'm
most
awfully
fond
of
music
too
exclaimed
Emerentsiya
You
're
not
only
fond
of
it
you
're
a
first
rate
musician
yourself
observed
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
Really
asked
Boris
Andreyitch
Both
Emerentsiya
Kalimonovna
and
Pela
geya
Kalimonovna
sing
and
play
the
piano
very
well
especially
Emerentsiya
Kalimonovna
On
hearing
her
name
Polinka
flushed
crim
son
and
almost
started
up
from
her
seat
while
Emerentsiya
modestly
cast
down
her
eyes
Oh
Mesdemoiselles
said
Boris
Andreyitch
surely
you
will
not
refuse
to
be
so
good
to
give
me
the
pleasure
Really
I
do
n't
know
And
cast
ing
a
sly
glance
at
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
she
added
reproachfully
Oh
what
a
man
you
are
But
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
like
a
practical
person
at
once
appealed
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
Pelageya
Ivanovna
he
said
please
tell
your
daughters
to
play
or
sing
us
something
I
do
n't
know
whether
they
are
in
voice
to
day
but
they
can
try
Yes
try
try
their
father
urged
Oh
Maman
but
how
can
we
Emerance
quand
je
vous
dis
Pela
geya
Ivanovna
pronounced
in
a
low
voice
but
very
gravely
She
had
the
habit
common
to
many
mothers
of
giving
orders
or
addressing
reproofs
to
her
children
before
other
persons
in
French
even
though
those
persons
understood
that
language
and
this
practice
was
the
more
strange
in
her
case
as
she
knew
very
little
French
and
pro
nounced
it
badly
Emerentsiya
got
up
What
are
we
going
to
sing
Maman
f
she
asked
submissively
Your
duet
it
's
very
charming
My
daugh
ters
Pelageya
Ivanovna
went
on
addressing
Boris
Andreyitch
have
different
voices
Emer
entsiya
a
treble
Soprano
you
mean
Yes
Yes
Somprano
and
Polinka
contro-alto
Ah
Contralto
That
's
very
nice
I
ca
n't
sing
to-day
Polinka
brought
out
with
an
effort
I
am
hoarse
Her
voice
cer
tainly
sounded
more
like
a
bass
than
a
con
tralto
Ah
well
if
so
Emerance
you
sing
us
your
piece
the
Italian
one
our
favourite
and
Po
linka
will
accompany
you
The
piece
where
you
go
pattering
like
peas
her
father
chimed
in
The
bravura
explained
the
mother
The
two
young
ladies
went
to
the
piano
Polinka
raised
the
lid
put
a
book
of
manuscript
music
on
the
music
rest
and
sat
down
while
Emerentsiya
stood
by
her
throwing
herself
not
too
obviously
into
charming
attitudes
under
the
fixed
gaze
of
Boris
Andreyitch
and
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
and
at
times
putting
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
At
last
she
began
to
sing
as
for
the
most
part
young
ladies
do
sing
shrilly
and
going
off
at
moments
into
howls
She
did
not
articulate
the
words
distinctly
but
from
certain
nasal
sounds
it
could
be
surmised
that
she
was
singing
in
Italian
Towards
the
end
she
really
did
break
into
a
patter
like
peas
to
the
huge
delight
of
Kali
mon
Ivanitch
he
raised
himself
slightly
in
his
easy-chair
and
exclaimed
Give
it
him
But
the
last
trill
she
let
off
earlier
than
she
should
so
that
her
sister
had
to
play
a
few
bars
by
herself
This
did
not
however
prevent
Boris
Andreyitch
from
expressing
his
pleasure
and
paying
Emerentsiya
compliments
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
after
repeating
twice
Very
good
very
good
added
Could
n't
you
give
us
something
Russian
now
the
'Nightingale
for
instance
or
the
'Little
Sarafan
or
some
gipsy
song
These
foreign
pieces
to
tell
the
truth
are
not
written
for
people
like
us
I
agree
with
you
said
Kalimon
Ivanitch
Chant
e
le
Sarafan
the
mother
observed
in
an
undertone
and
with
the
same
severity
as
before
No
not
the
'Sarafan
interposed
Kalimon
Ivanitch
but
'We
Two
Gipsy
Girls
or
'Take
Off
Your
Cap
and
Make
a
Low
Bow
do
you
know
it
Papa
You
are
always
like
that
Emer
entsiya
protested
and
she
sang
Take
Off
Your
Cap
and
sang
it
fairly
well
Kalimon
Ivanitch
joined
in
humming
and
beating
time
with
his
foot
while
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
quite
delighted
Come
that
's
a
different
thing
That
's
in
our
style
he
declared
You
have
delighted
me
Emerentsiya
Kalimonovna
Now
I
see
that
you
have
the
right
to
call
yourself
a
devotee
of
music
and
a
mistress
of
your
art
Oh
how
indiscreet
you
are
retorted
Emer
entsiya
and
would
have
gone
back
to
her
seat
A
present
le
'Sarafan
said
the
mother
Emerentsiya
sang
the
Sarafan
not
so
suc
cessfully
as
Take
Off
Your
Cap
but
still
suc
cessfully
Now
you
ought
to
play
us
your
Sonata
duet
observed
Pelageya
Ivanovna
though
perhaps
that
will
be
better
another
time
or
I'm
afraid
we
shall
weary
Monsieur
Vyazovnin
No
indeed
Boris
Andreyitch
but
Polinka
closed
the
piano
at
once
and
Emer
entsiya
declared
that
she
was
tired
Boris
Andreyitch
thought
it
necessary
to
repeat
his
compliment
Oh
Monsieur
Vyazovnin
she
answered
I
expect
you
have
heard
very
different
singers
I
can
imagine
what
my
singing
must
seem
like
after
them
though
indeed
when
Bome
rius
was
here
he
did
say
to
me
You've
heard
of
Bomerius
I
expect
No
what
Bomerius
Good
gracious
The
celebrated
violinist
he
studied
in
the
Paris
Conservatoire
a
wonderful
musician
He
said
to
me
'With
your
voice
Mademoiselle
if
you
could
study
under
a
good
teacher
it
would
be
simply
marvellous
He
kissed
all
his
fingers
to
me
but
how
is
one
to
study
here
And
Emerentsiya
heaved
a
sigh
No
indeed
Boris
Andreyitch
assented
po
litely
but
with
your
talent
He
was
at
a
loss
for
words
and
looked
away
still
more
politely
Emerance
demandez
pourquoi
que
le
diner
said
Pelageya
Ivanovna
''Qui
Maman
replied
Emerentsiya
and
she
went
out
with
a
sprightly
little
skip
at
the
door
She
would
not
have
made
the
skip
if
there
had
not
been
visitors
Boris
Andreyitch
turned
to
Polinka
If
this
is
the
Larin
family
he
thought
perhaps
this
one
is
Tatyana
And
he
went
up
to
Polinka
who
watched
his
approach
not
without
terror
You
played
your
sister
's
accompaniment
charmingly
he
began
charmingly
Polinka
made
no
answer
she
merely
turned
crimson
to
her
ears
I
'm
very
sorry
I
've
not
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
your
duet
from
what
opera
is
it
Polinka
's
eyes
wandered
uneasily
Vyazovnin
waited
for
her
answer
no
answer
came
What
sort
of
music
do
you
like
best
he
asked
after
a
brief
interval
Italian
or
Ger
man
Polinka
looked
down
Pelagic
repondez
done
Pelageya
Ivanovna
brought
out
in
an
agitated
whisper
Any
sort
Polinka
articulated
hurriedly
Any
sort
Boris
Andreyitch
persisted
That
's
hard
to
believe
Beethoven
for
in
stance
is
a
genius
of
the
first
rank
and
yet
he
is
not
appreciated
by
everyone
No
answered
Polinka
Art
is
infinitely
varied
Boris
Andreyitch
continued
mercilessly
Yes
answered
Polinka
The
conversation
between
them
did
not
last
long
No
thought
Boris
Andreyitch
as
he
moved
away
from
her
she
is
not
a
Tatyana
she
is
simply
a
tremor
personified
And
when
poor
Polinka
was
going
to
bed
that
evening
she
complained
with
tears
to
her
maid
that
the
visitor
to-day
had
pestered
her
with
music
and
that
she
had
not
known
what
to
answer
and
that
she
was
always
wretched
when
visitors
came
it
only
meant
that
Mamma
scolded
afterwards
that
was
all
the
pleasure
she
got
out
of
it
At
dinner
Boris
Andreyitch
sat
between
Kali
mon
Ivanitch
and
Emerentsiya
The
dinner
was
Russian
not
elaborate
but
ample
and
far
more
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
's
taste
than
the
wid
ow
's
recherche
dishes
Polinka
was
sitting
be
side
him
and
overcoming
her
shyness
at
last
she
did
anyway
answer
his
questions
Emerentsiya
on
the
other
hand
entertained
her
neighbour
so
zealously
that
at
last
he
could
hardly
endure
it
She
had
the
habit
of
turn
ing
her
head
do
the
right
while
she
lifted
a
morsel
to
her
mouth
with
the
left
hand
as
if
she
was
playing
with
it
and
Boris
Andreyitch
very
much
disliked
this
habit
He
disliked
too
the
way
in
which
she
incessantly
talked
about
herself
confiding
to
him
with
much
feeling
the
most
trivial
details
of
her
life
but
as
a
well
bred
man
he
made
no
outward
sign
of
his
senti
ments
so
that
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
who
was
watching
him
across
the
table
was
quite
unable
to
decide
what
sort
of
impression
Emerentsiya
was
making
upon
him
After
dinner
Kalimon
Ivanitch
suddenly
sank
into
meditation
or
to
speak
more
directly
a
slight
doze
he
was
accustomed
to
take
a
nap
after
dinner
and
though
noticing
that
his
guests
were
preparing
to
take
their
leave
he
articu
lated
several
times
But
why
is
this
gentle
men
what
for
How
about
a
game
of
cards
yet
in
his
heart
he
was
pleased
when
he
saw
that
they
had
their
caps
in
their
hands
Pela
geya
Ivanovna
on
the
contrary
grew
alert
at
once
and
with
peculiar
insistence
tried
to
keep
her
visitors
Emerentsiya
zealously
seconded
her
and
did
everything
she
could
to
persuade
them
to
remain
even
Polinka
said
Mais
Messieurs
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
answered
neither
yes
nor
no
and
kept
looking
towards
his
companion
but
Boris
Andreyitch
courteously
but
firmly
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
returning
home
It
was
in
fact
just
the
opposite
of
their
leave
taking
from
Sofya
Kirillovna
Promising
to
repeat
their
visit
very
shortly
the
visitors
at
last
withdrew
Emerentsiya's
cordial
glances
followed
them
to
the
dining
room
while
Kalimon
Ivanitch
even
went
out
with
them
to
the
hall
and
after
watching
Boris
Andreyitch
's
adroit
servant
wrap
the
gentlemen
in
their
fur
coats
wind
their
scarves
round
them
and
draw
their
warm
top
boots
on
to
their
feet
went
back
to
liis
study
and
promptly
fell
asleep
while
Polinka
after
being
put
to
shame
by
her
mother
went
off
to
her
own
room
upstairs
and
the
two
mute
feminine
figures
one
in
a
cap
the
other
in
a
dark
kerchief
con
gratulated
Emerentsiya
on
her
new
conquest
The
friends
drove
off
in
silence
Boris
An
dreyitch
smiled
to
himself
screened
from
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
by
the
turned-up
collar
of
his
rac
coon-lined
coat
and
waited
to
see
what
he
would
say
Not
the
thing
again
exclaimed
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
But
this
time
a
certain
indecision
was
notice
able
in
his
voice
and
straining
to
get
a
look
at
Boris
Andreyitch
over
his
fur
collar
he
added
in
an
enquiring
voice
It
's
not
is
it
No
Boris
Andreyitch
answered
with
a
laugh
I
thought
not
replied
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
and
after
a
brief
silence
he
added
Though
after
all
why
not
In
what
way
is
the
young
lady
deficient
She
's
not
deficient
in
anything
on
the
con
trary
she
has
too
much
of
everything
How
do
you
mean
too
much
What
I
say
Excuse
me
Boris
Andreyitch
I
do
n't
under
stand
you
If
you
're
speaking
of
culture
is
that
amiss
And
as
regards
character
con
duct
Oh
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
said
Boris
Andrey
itch
I
'm
surprised
that
with
your
clear
way
of
looking
at
things
you
do
n't
see
through
that
mincing
Emerentsiya
That
affected
amiabil
ity
that
continual
self-adoration
that
modest
conviction
of
her
own
virtues
that
indulgence
of
an
angel
looking
down
on
you
from
the
heights
of
heaven
but
there
's
no
need
of
words
If
it
came
to
that
in
case
of
necessity
I
'd
twenty
times
rather
marry
her
sister
She
does
know
how
to
hold
her
tongue
anyway
You
're
right
of
course
poor
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
answered
in
a
low
voice
Boris
Andrey
itch
's
sudden
outburst
perplexed
him
No
he
said
to
himself
and
he
said
it
for
the
first
time
since
his
acquaintance
with
Vyazov
nin
this
fellow
's
not
on
my
level
He's
too
well
educated
Vyazovnin
for
his
part
was
thinking
as
he
gazed
at
the
moon
which
hung
low
over
the
white
rim
of
the

And
that

Round

But
a
queer
sort
of
Lensky
I

got
and
I
'm

he
added
aloud
So
it
's
not
the
thing
Boris
Andreyitch
asked
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
jestingly
as
with

The

friends
and

assistance
of
his
groom
he
got
out
of
the
sledge
and
mounted
the
steps
of
his
house
Eh
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
But
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
made
him
no
answer
and
went
home
that
night
to
sleep
Emerentsiya
next
day
wrote
to
her
friend
she
carried
on
a
vast
and
active
correspond
ence
A
new
visitor
came
to
see
us
yesterday
a
neighbour
called
Vyazovnin
He
is
a
very
charming
and
amiable
person
one
can
see
at
once
that
he
is
highly
cultured
and
shall
I
whisper
it
in
your
ear
I
fancy
I
made
rather
an
impression
upon
him
But
do
n't
be
uneasy
mon
amie
my
heart
was
not
touched
and
Valentin
has
nothing
to
fear
The
Valentin
referred
to
was
a
high-school
teacher
He
was
a
gay
dog
when
he
was
in
the
town
while
in
the
country
he
heaved
pla
tonic
and
hopeless
sighs
for
Emerentsiya
The
friends
met
again
next
morning
as
usual
and
their
life
flowed
on
in
its
old
way
A
fortnight
passed
Boris
Andreyitch
was
in
daily
expectation
of
a
fresh
summons
but
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
seemed
to
have
completely
relinquished
his
design
Boris
Andreyitch
began
talking
of
the
widow
and
of
the
Tihoduevs
and
hinting
that
one
ought
to
give
everything
three
trials
but
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
gave
no
sign
of
understanding
his
hints
At
last
Boris
Andreyitch
could
not
re
frain
from
beginning
How
's
this
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
he
said
It
seems
it
's
my
turn
now
to
remind
you
of
your
promises
What
promises
Do
n't
you
remember
you
meant
to
marry
me
I
am
waiting
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
turned
round
on
his
chair
But
you
see
you
're
so
particular
There's
no
satisfying
you
God
knows
what
you
want
It
seems
we
've
no
young
ladies
here
to
your
taste
That
's
too
bad
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
You
ought
not
to
despair
so
soon
To
fail
twice
is
not
much
to
complain
of
Besides
I
did
like
the
widow
If
you
abandon
me
I
'll
go
off
to
her
Well
go
then
and
God
bless
you
S
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
I
assure
you
I
do
want
to
get
married
in
earnest
take
me
somewhere
else
But
really
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
whole
district
That
's
impossible
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Do
you
mean
to
say
there
's
not
one
pretty
girl
here
in
the
whole
neighbourhood
Of
course
there
are
plenty
but
not
a
match
for
you
But
do
name
someone
anyway
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
held
the
amber
of
his
pipe
in
his
teeth
Well
there
's
Verotchka
Barsukov
of
course
he
brought
out
at
last
what
could
be
better
Only
not
for
you
Why
not
Too
simple
All
the
better
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
All
the
better
And
her
father
is
such
a
queer
fish
That
does
n't
matter
either
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
my
dear
fellow
do
introduce
me
to
this
what
did
you
call
the
young
lady
Barsukov
To
this
Barsukov
girl
please
And
Boris
Andreyitch
gave
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
no
rest
until
the
latter
promised
to
take
him
to
the
Barsukovs
Two
days
later
they
drove
off
to
see
them
The
Barstikov
family
consisted
of
two
per
sons
the
father
aged
fifty
and
the
daughter
aged
nineteen
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
had
correctly
described
the
father
as
a
queer
fish
he
really
was
a
singular
person
if
ever
there
was
one
After
brilliantly
completing
a
course
of
study
in
a
Government
institution
he
entered
the
Marine
service
and
quickly
attracted
the
atten
tion
of
his
superior
officers
But
he
suddenly
retired
from
the
Service
married
settled
in
the
country
and
by
degrees
had
grown
lazy
and
let
himself
go
to
such
a
point
that
he
not
merely
gave
up
going
out
anywhere
but
did
not
even
leave
his
room
In
a
short
full
hare
skin
coat
and
slippers
without
any
back
to
them
with
his
hands
thrust
in
the
pockets
of
his
loose
Turkish
trousers
he
would
walk
to
and
fro
for
days
together
hum
ming
or
whistling
and
whatever
was
said
to
him
he
would
answer
with
a
smile
Braoo
Braoo
by
which
he
meant
Bravo
Bravo
Do
you
know
Stepan
Petrovitch
a
neigh
bour
would
say
to
him
for
instance
and
neighbours
went
to
see
him
readily
for
no
man
could
have
been
more
hospitable
and
genial
Do
you
know
they
say
the
price
of
rye
has
gone
up
to
thirteen
paper
roubles
at
Byelovo
Braoo
Braoo
Barsukov
would
answer
calmly
though
he
had
just
sold
his
rye
for
seven
and
a
half
And
have
you
heard
that
your
neighbour
Pavel
Fomitch
has
lost
twenty
thousand
at
cards
Braoo
Braoo
Barsukov
would
answer
just
as
calmly
There
's
the
cattle-plague
at
Salykovo
an
other
neighbour
sitting
with
them
would
ob
serve
Braoo
Braoo
The
Lapin
young
lady
has
run
off
with
the
bailiff
Braoo
Braoo
Braoo
And
so
on
endlessly
If
he
were
informed
that
his
horse
had
gone
lame
that
a
Jew
had
arrived
with
goods
that
the
clock
had
fallen
off
the
wall
that
the
boy
had
mislaid
his
boots
somewhere
the
only
comment
heard
from
him
was
Braoo
Braoo
and
yet
there
was
no
great
disorder
to
be
noticed
in
his
house
his
peasants
were
prosperous
and
he
made
no
debts
Barsukov
's
appearance
was
preposses
sing
his
round
face
with
large
brown
eyes
a
delicate
regular
nose
and
red
lips
was
re
markable
from
its
almost
youthful
freshness
This
freshness
was
the
more
striking
from
the
snowy
whiteness
of
his
hair
a
faint
smile
was
almost
continually
playing
on
his
lips
and
not
so
much
on
his
lips
as
in
the
dimples
in
his
cheeks
he
never
laughed
but
sometimes
very
rarely
giggled
hysterically
and
on
every
such
occasion
felt
unwell
afterwards
Apart
from
his
habitual
exclamation
he
said
very
little
and
only
what
was
quite
essential
with
the
utmost
possible
brevity
His
daughter
Verotchka
was
very
much
like
him
in
face
in
her
way
of
smiling
and
in
the
expression
of
her
dark
eyes
which
seemed
still
darker
from
the
delicate
tint
of
her
flaxen
hair
She
was
rather
short
and
charmingly
propor
TH
TWO
FRIEiSTDS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
tioned
There
was
nothing
specially
attractive
about
her
but
one
had
only
to
glance
at
her
or
hear
the
sound
of
her
voice
to
say
to
one
self
That
's
a
good
kind
creature
The
father
and
daughter
were
fond
of
each
other
the
whole
management
of
the
house
was
in
her
hands
and
she
liked
looking
after
it
She
had
no
other
pursuits
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
had
correctly
described
her
as
simple
When
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
and
Boris
Andrey
itch
called
upon
Barsukov
he
was
as
usual
walking
up
and
down
in
his
study
This
study
which
might
have
been
called
a
draw
ing-room
and
a
dining-room
since
visitors
were
received
and
meals
were
served
in
it
formed
about
half
of
the
little
house
The
furniture
in
it
was
ugly
but
comfort
able
along
the
whole
length
of
one
of
the
walls
stood
an
extrfemely
broad
and
soft
sofa
with
a
multitude
of
cushions
a
sofa
very
well
known
to
all
the
gentlemen
of
the
neighbour
hood
To
tell
the
truth
one
could
lie
luxuriously
on
that
sofa
In
the
other
rooms
there
were
only
chairs
little
tables
of
one
sort
or
another
and
cupboards
all
these
rooms
led
into
one
another
and
no
one
lived
in
them
Verotchka's
little
bedroom
looked
into
the
garden
and
ex
cept
for
her
neat
little
bed
and
washing
stand
with
a
little
looking-glass
over
it
and
one
arm
chair
there
was
no
furniture
in
it
either
On
the
other
hand
everywhere
in
all
the
corners
there
were
bottles
of
liqueurs
and
jars
of
jam
prepared
by
Verotchka
's
own
hand
On
going
into
the
hall
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
would
have
sent
in
his
name
and
Boris
An
dreyitch
's
but
a
boy
in
a
long-skirted
coat
merely
glanced
at
him
and
began
taking
off
his
fur
coat
with
the
words
Please
walk
in
Sir
The
friends
went
into
Stepan
Petrovitch's
study
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
introduced
Boris
Andreyitch
Stepan
Petrovitch
pressed
his
hand
articu
lated
Delighted
very
you
're
cold
vodka
and
with
a
motion
of
his
head
indicating
the
edibles
that
stood
on
a
little
table
he
fell
to
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
again
Boris
Andreyitch
drank
off
a
little
glass
of
i
vodka
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
did
the
same
and
they
both
sat
down
on
the
broad
sofa
with
a
multitude
of
cushions
Boris
Andreyitch
felt
at
once
as
though
he
had
been
sitting
on
that
sofa
for
ages
and
had
known
the
master
of
the
house
for
long
long
years
All
Barsukov's
visitors
were
familiar
with
that
feeling
He
was
not
alone
that
day
and
indeed
he
could
not
often
be
found
alone
There
was
sitting
with
him
a
pettifogging
clerk
a
thread
bare
hack
with
a
wrinkled
face
like
an
old
woman
's
a
hawk
nose
and
restless
eyes
who
had
lately
had
a
snug
little
job
in
the
Govern
ment
service
but
was
at
the
moment
awaiting
his
trial
for
some
malpractice
Holding
on
to
his
cravat
with
one
hand
and
the
lapel
of
his
coat
with
the
other
this
gentleman
was
keep
ing
watch
on
Stepan
Petrovitch
and
waiting
till
the
guests
were
seated
he
brought
out
with
a
deep
sigh
Oh
Stepan
Petrovitch
Stepan
Petrovitch
It
's
easy
to
condemn
a
man
but
you
know
the
saying
'The
honest
man
's
a
sinner
the
rogue's
a
sinner
they
all
live
by
sin
and
so
do
we
Braoo
Stepan
Petrovitch
was
beginning
but
he
checked
himself
and
commented
A
nasty
saying
Who
denies
it
Of
course
it
's
nasty
re
pHed
the
threadbare
gentleman
but
what
would
you
have
one
do
Poverty
is
not
one's
brother
you
know
it
eats
the
honesty
out
of
you
Here
I
'm
ready
to
appeal
to
these
noble
gentlemen
if
only
they
'll
be
so
good
as
to
listen
to
the
circumstances
of
my
case
May
I
smoke
Boris
Andreyitch
asked
his
host
The
latter
nodded
Of
course
the
threadbare
gentleman
con
tinued
I
too
perhaps
have
more
than
once
been
vexed
both
with
myself
and
the
world
generally
have
felt
so
to
say
the
generous
indignation
Invented
by
scoundrels
Stepan
Petrovitch
interrupted
The
gentleman
started
That
is
How
's
that
Stepan
Petrov
itch
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
generous
in
dignation
is
invented
by
scoundrels
Stepan
Petrovitch
gave
a
nod
again
The
gentleman
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
broke
into
a
cracked
laugh
display
ing
as
he
did
so
that
he
had
not
a
tooth
left
in
his
head
yet
he
spoke
fairly
clearly
He
he
Stepan
Petrovitch
you
always
talk
like
that
Our
attorney
may
well
say
of
you
that
you're
a
regular
humourist
Braoo
Braoo
replied
Barsukov
At
that
instant
the
door
opened
and
Ve
rotchka
walked
in
Moving
with
a
firm
and
light
tread
she
brought
in
two
cups
of
coffee
and
a
jug
of
cream
on
a
round
green
tray
Her
dark-grey
dress
hung
gracefully
about
her
slender
form
Boris
Andreyitch
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
both
got
up
from
the
sofa
she
made
them
a
curtsey
in
response
without
put
ting
down
the
tray
then
going
up
to
the
table
laid
her
burden
on
it
with
the
words
Here
is
your
coffee
Braoo
said
her
father
Two
more
cups
he
added
indicating
the
visitors
Boris
An
dreyitch
my
daughter
Boris
Andreyitch
made
her
a
second
bow
Will
you
have
coffee
she
asked
looking
quietly
straight
into
his
eyes
It
's
an
hour
and
a
half
to
dinner
time
''With
the
greatest
pleasure
answered
Boris
Andreyitch
Verotchka
turned
to
Krupitsyn
And
you
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
I
'll
have
a
cup
too
In
a
minute
It
's
a
long
time
since
I
've
seen
you
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Saying
this
Ver
otchka
went
out
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
after
her
and
bend
ing
down
to
his
friend
whispered
in
his
ear
But
she
's
very
sweet
and
what
easy
manners
That
's
habit
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
answered
Why
it
's
something
hke
a
restaurant
here
there
's
always
someone
coming
or
going
As
though
to
confirm
Pyotr
Vassilyitch's
words
another
visitor
walked
into
the
room
This
was
a
very
corpulent
to
use
the
old-fash
ioned
word
that
has
been
preserved
in
our
part
of
the
country
full-bodied
gentleman
with
a
big
face
big
eyes
and
lips
end
thick
ruffled
hair
An
expression
of
permanent
dissatisfaction
a
sour
expression
could
be
detected
in
his
coun
tenance
He
was
wearing
a
very
roomy
coat
and
his
whole
person
swayed
as
he
walked
He
sank
heavily
onto
the
sofa
and
only
then
said
Good-day
without
however
addressing
any
one
of
the
company
in
particular
Vodka
Stepan
Petrovitch
asked
him
No
Vodka
indeed
answered
the
new
guest
I
do
n't
want
vodka
How
are
you
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
he
added
looking
round
Good-day
Mihey
Miheyitch
answered
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
where
's
God
brought
you
from
Where
from
From
town
of
course
It's
only
you
lucky
fellows
who
've
no
need
to
go
to
town
but
I
thanks
to
the
trustees
and
to
these
gentry
he
added
jerking
his
finger
in
the
direction
of
the
gentleman
who
was
await
ing
his
trial
I
've
knocked
up
all
my
horses
trailing
off
to
the
town
confound
it
Our
humble
respects
to
Mihey
Miheyitch
said
the
gentleman
who
had
been
so
uncere
moniously
included
in
the
term
gentry
Mihey
Miheyitch
looked
at
him
Tell
me
one
thing
please
he
began
fold
ing
his
arms
when
are
you
going
to
be
hanged
The
other
was
offended
But
you
ought
to
be
Upon
my
soul
you
ought
The
Government
is
too
indulgent
to
fellows
like
you
Let
me
tell
you
that
Why
does
it
trouble
you
that
you
're
to
be
tried
Not
a
bit
of
it
There
's
only
one
thing
may
be
annoying
now
there
's
no
hahen
sie'gewesen
now
And
Mihey
Miheyitch
made
a
motion
with
his
hand
as
though
he
had
caught
something
in
the
air
and
thrust
it
into
his
side
pocket
They
've
put
a
stop
to
that
Ah
you
riff
raff
You
're
always
pleased
to
be

clerk
