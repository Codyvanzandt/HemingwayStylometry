must
pay
us
another
visit
at
Marino
later
I
will
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
have
left
some
of
my
things
there
Bazarov
still
had
his
face
turned
to
the
wall
Why
does
he
not
ask
me
the
reason
of
my
departure
a
departure
as
sudden
as
his
reflected
Arkady
Why
is
either
of
us
departing
for
that
matter
As
he
continued
to
reflect
he
realised
that
while
unable
to
return
a
satisfactory
answer
to
the
question
propounded
he
seemed
to
have
got
a
heartache
somehow
to
be
feeling
that
he
would
find
it
hard
to
part
with
the
life
at
Nikolsköe
to
which
he
was
grown
so
accustomed
Yet
he
could
not
remain
there
alone
That
would
be
worse
still
Between
him
and
her
there
is
something
in
the
wind
he
reflected
That
being
so
what
would
my
sticking
here
avail
after
he
had
gone
I
should
weary
Anna
Sergievna
and
lose
my
last
chance
of
pleasing
her
Then
he
began
to
draw
a
mental
picture
of
the
lady
whom
he
had
just
named
until
there
cut
across
the
fair
presentment
of
the
young
widow
another
set
of
features
Katia
too
I
shall
miss
he
whispered
to
his
pillow
which
had
already
received
one
of
his
tears
At
length
raising
his
curly
poll
he
exclaimed
What
in
the
devil
's
name
brought
that
idiot
Sitnikov
here
He
heard
Bazarov
stir
under
the
bedclothes
then
remark
You
yourself
are
an
idiot
We
need
the
Sitnikovs
of
this
world
Such
donkeys
are
absolutely
necessary
to
us
to
me
The
gods
ought
not
to
have
to
bake
pots
Ah
reflected
Arkady
For
as
in
a
flash
there
had
become
revealed
to
him
the
bottomless
profundity
of
Bazarov
's
conceit
Then
you
and
I
are
the
gods
he
said
aloud
Or
are
you
a
god
and
I
a
donkey
You
are
came
the
gruff
reply
As
yet
at
all
events
you
are
No
particular
astonishment
was
evinced
by
Madame
Odintsov
when
on
the
following
day
Arkady
informed
her
that
it
was
his
intention
to
accompany
Bazarov
Rather
she
looked
distraught
and
weary
Katia
glanced
at
him
gravely
and
in
silence
and
the
Princess
went
so
far
as
to
cross
herself
under
her
shawl
a
precaution
against
the
young
men
observing
the
gesture
Sitnikov
too
was
dumbfounded
at
having
just
entered
the
breakfast-room
in
a
new
and
most
elegant
suit
this
time
not
of
Slavophil
cut
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
he
had
also
had
the
pleasure
of
amazing
his
temporary
valet
with
the
multitude
of
his
shirts
only
to
find
himself
confronted
with
the
prospect
of
being
deserted
by
his
comrades
He
shuffled
and
wriggled
like
a
hare
driven
to
the
edge
of
a
covert
and
blurted
out
almost
in
panic-stricken
fashion
that
he
too
had
a
great
mind
to
depart
Nor
did
Madame
Odintsov
make
any
great
effort
to
dissuade
him
I
have
an
exceedingly
comfortable
koliaska
the
unfortunate
young
man
said
to
Arkady
and
I
could
give
you
a
lift
in
it
and
leave
Evgenii
Vasilitch
to
use
your
tarantass
which
would
suit
him
better
than
the
koliaska
But
I
should
not
like
to
take
you
so
far
out
of
your
way
for
the
distance
to
my
home
is
considerable
That
would
not
matter
that
would
not
matter
I
have
plenty
of
time
to
spare
and
also
some
business
to
do
in
that
direction
What
Leasehold
business
again
inquired
Arkady
disparagingly
But
Sitnikov
was
so
distraught
that
he
forbore
to
giggle
in
his
usual
fashion
I
can
guarantee
that
the
koliaska
is
comfortable
he
repeated
Indeed
it
could
hold
all
three
of
us
Do
not
vex
Monsieur
Sitnikov
by
refusing
put
in
Madame
Odintsov
So
with
a
meaning
glance
at
her
Arkady
nodded
assent
to
Sitnikov
Breakfast
over
the
guests
departed
Anna
Sergievna
offered
Bazarov
her
hand
I
hope
we
shall
meet
again
she
said
Only
if
you
wish
it
he
replied
Then
we
shall
meet
again
The
first
to
issue
upon
the
verandah
and
enter
Sitnikov
's
koliaska
was
Arkady
The
butler
assisted
him
obsequiously
although
Arkady
could
with
equal
readiness
have
struck
the
man
or
burst
into
tears
As
for
Bazarov
he
took
possession
of
the
tarantass
Khokhlovskïe
Viselki
reached
Arkady
waited
until
Thedot
the
local
posting-master
had
harnessed
fresh
horses
and
then
approaching
the
tarantass
said
to
Bazarov
with
his
old
smile
Evgenii
take
me
with
you
I
should
like
to
come
to
your
place
after
all
Get
in
then
muttered
Bazarov
This
made
Sitnikov
who
had
been
walking
up
and
down
beside
his
conveyance
and
whistling
fairly
gasp
Nevertheless
the
heartless
Arkady
removed
his
luggage
from
the
koliaska
seated
himself
beside
Bazarov
and
according
his
late
fellow-traveller
a
courteous
bow
shouted
Right
away
The
tarantass
started
and
soon
was
lost
to
view
Much
taken
aback
Sitnikov
gazed
at
his
coachman
But
the
latter
was
flicking
the
flanks
of
the
trace
horse
with
his
whip
and
therefore
Sitnikov
had
no
choice
but
to
leap
into
the
vehicle
to
shout
to
a
couple
of
peasants
Off
with
your
caps
you
rascals
and
be
driven
to
the
town
whither
he
arrived
at
a
late
hour
and
where
on
the
following
day
he
declared
to
Madame
Kukshin
that
he
had
had
enough
of
those
odious
churls
and
upstarts
On
Arkady
seating
himself
beside
Bazarov
in
the
tarantass
he
pressed
his
hand
and
Bazarov
seemed
to
divine
the
meaning
of
the
silent
hand-clasp
and
to
appreciate
it
During
the
previous
night
the
elder
man
had
never
once
closed
his
eyes
Also
for
several
days
past
he
had
neither
smoked
a
cigar
nor
eaten
more
than
the
merest
scrap
of
food
Indeed
as
he
sat
in
the
tarantass
his
fine-drawn
profile
under
the
overshadowing
cap
looked
sharper
and
grimmer
than
ever
Give
me
a
cigar
will
you
he
said
Also
pray
look
at
my
tongue
and
tell
me
if
it
has
a
bilious
appearance
Yes
it
has
replied
Arkady
I
thought
so
for
this
cigar
seems
tasteless
Moreover
the
infernal
thing
has
come
unrolled
You
have
changed
a
good
deal
of
late
hazarded
Arkady
I
daresay
But
I
shall
be
myself
again
soon
The
only
thing
now
troubling
me
is
the
fact
that
my
mother
is
so
good-naturedly
fussy
Should
one
's
paunch
not
be
projecting
or
should
one
not
eat
at
least
ten
meals
a
day
she
relapses
into
despair
My
father
of
course
is
different
for
he
has
been
all
over
the
world
and
knows
what
is
what
This
cigar
is
simply
unsmokable
And
Bazarov
consigned
it
to
the
dust
of
the
roadway
The
distance
to
your
place
is
twenty-five
versts
I
suppose
queried
Arkady
It
is
so
But
inquire
of
that
sage
there
And
Bazarov
pointed
to
the
peasant
an
employé
of
Thedot
's
who
was
seated
on
the
box
The
sage
in
question
replied
that
he
could
not
say
exactly
since
the
verst-posts
in
those
parts
had
not
been
measured
out
after
which
he
went
on
to
swear
at
the
shaft
horse
for
kicking
its
jowl
about
that
is
to
say
jerking
its
head
up
and
down
Aye
aye
commented
Bazarov
Take
warning
from
me
my
young
friend
An
instructive
example
sits
before
you
an
example
of
the
vanity
of
this
world
By
a
single
thread
does
the
destiny
of
every
man
hang
and
at
any
moment
there
may
open
before
him
an
abyss
into
which
he
and
his
may
plunge
For
always
he
is
laying
up
for
himself
misfortune
At
what
are
you
hinting
asked
Arkady
At
nothing
I
am
merely
saying
outright
that
you
and
I
have
behaved
very
foolishly
However
why
talk
of
it
I
have
noticed
that
in
surgical
operations
it
is
the
patient
who
fights
against
his
hurt
who
soonest
gets
well
I
do
not
understand
you
Arkady
said
So
far
as
I
can
see
you
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
complain
of
You
can
not
understand
me
Well
mark
this
that
you
had
far
better
go
and
break
stones
by
the
roadside
than
allow
a
woman
to
obtain
even
the
least
hold
over
you
Such
a
thing
is
sheer
he
nearly
said
Romanticism
but
changed
his
mind
rubbish
Perhaps
you
do
not
believe
me
he
went
on
Nevertheless
I
tell
you
that
though
you
and
I
have
been
cultivating
feminine
society
and
enjoying
it
the
sense
of
relief
when
such
society
is
abandoned
is
like
taking
a
cold
bath
on
a
summer
's
day
Never
ought
a
man
to
touch
such
follies
Always
he
ought
as
the
excellent
Spanish
saying
has
it
'to
remain
as
the
beasts
of
the
field
Look
here
he
added
to
the
peasant
on
the
box
Do
you
my
man
of
wisdom
possess
a
wife
The
peasant
turned
a
portion
of
a
flat
near-sighted
visage
in
the
friends
direction
A
wife
he
repeated
Yes
I
do
Why
should
n't
I
Never
mind
that
Do
you
ever
beat
her
My
wife
Sometimes
But
never
without
good
cause
Excellent
And
does
she
ever
beat
you
The
peasant
gave
his
reins
a
jerk
What
a
thing
barin
he
exclaimed
Surely
you
must
be
joking
Evidently
the
question
had
offended
him
You
hear
that
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
said
Bazarov
You
and
I
have
been
similarly
beaten
That
is
what
comes
of
being
gentry
Arkady
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
but
Bazarov
turned
away
and
did
not
speak
again
until
the
end
of
the
journey
To
Arkady
the
twenty-five
versts
seemed
like
fifty
but
at
length
there
came
into
view
on
the
slope
of
a
low
hill
the
homestead
of
the
manor
where
Bazarov
's
parents
resided
On
one
side
of
it
amid
a
clump
of
young
birch
trees
there
could
be
seen
the
servants
quarters
under
their
thatched
roofs
while
at
the
door
of
the
nearest
hut
a
couple
of
fur-capped
peasants
were
engaged
in
a
contest
of
mutual
abuse
You
are
an
old
pig
one
of
them
said
to
the
other
And
that
is
worse
than
being
a
young
one
Your
wife
is
a
witch
retorted
the
other
From
the
lack
of
restraint
in
their
bearing
commented
Bazarov
as
well
as
from
the
playfulness
of
their
terms
of
speech
you
will
gather
that
my
father
's
peasantry
are
not
downtrodden
But
here
is
my
father
himself
I
can
see
him
stepping
out
on
to
the
verandah
He
will
have
heard
the
sound
of
our
collar-bells
Yes
it
is
he
I
recognise
his
figure
But
how
grey
he
looks
poor
old
fellow
Bazarov
leant
forward
from
the
tarantass
and
Arkady
peering
over
his
friend
's
shoulder
beheld
on
the
entrance
steps
of
the
manor-house
a
tall
thin
man
with
dishevelled
hair
and
a
narrow
aquiline
nose
Clad
in
an
old
military
tunic
of
which
the
front
was
flying
open
he
was
standing
with
legs
apart
a
long
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
eyes
blinking
in
the
glare
of
the
sunlight
The
horses
pulled
up
So
you
have
come
at
last
exclaimed
Bazarov
's
father
still
continuing
to
smoke
though
as
he
did
so
the
stem
of
the
pipe
was
rattling
and
shaking
between
his
fingers
Now
jump
out
jump
out
Again
and
again
he
embraced
his
son
Eniusha
Eniusha
1
the
tremulous
voice
of
an
old
woman
also
cried
as
the
door
of
the
house
opened
and
there
appeared
on
the
threshold
a
short
rotund
old
dame
in
a
white
cap
and
a
short
striped
blouse
Gasping
and
staggering
she
would
have
fallen
had
not
Bazarov
hastened
to
support
her
As
he
did
so
her
fat
old
arms
clasped
him
around
the
neck
and
her
head
sank
upon
his
bosom
All
then
was
still
for
a
moment
Only
her
convulsive
sobs
broke
the
silence
Meanwhile
Bazarov
Senior
breathed
hard
and
blinked
more
vigorously
than
ever
Enough
enough
Arisha
he
said
at
length
with
a
glance
at
Arkady
who
had
remained
standing
beside
the
tarantass
and
even
the
peasant
on
the
box-seat
had
turned
away
his
head
Pray
cease
I
tell
you
This
is
not
necessary
I
beg
of
you
to
cease
Ah
Vasili
Ivanitch
whimpered
the
poor
old
woman
To
think
of
the
long
while
since
last
I
saw
my
Eniusha
my
own
my
darling
boy
Still
keeping
her
arms
clasped
around
Bazarov
she
withdrew
her
ruffled
convulsed
tear-stained
face
from
his
breast
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
blissful
yet
comical
eyes
and
glued
herself
again
to
his
bosom
Yes
yes
said
Vasili
Ivanitch
Such
is
in
the
nature
of
things
But
had
we
not
better
go
indoors
See
Evgenii
has
brought
a
guest
With
a
slight
scrape
and
a
bow
he
added
to
Arkady
Pray
pardon
us
sir
but
you
will
understand
the
situation
A
woman's
weakness
ahem
and
a
mother
's
heart
His
lips
chin
and
eyebrows
too
were
working
Evidently
he
was
striving
to
master
himself
and
to
appear
totally
indifferent
Arkady
responded
to
his
bow
with
a
like
salutation
Yes
yes
dear
mother
let
us
go
indoors
said
Bazarov
Leading
the
shaking
old
lady
into
the
house
he
seated
her
in
a
cosy
chair
bestowed
upon
his
father
another
hurried
embrace
and
then
presented
Arkady
I
am
glad
indeed
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
Vasili
Ivanitch
I
am
glad
indeed
But
do
not
expect
too
much
of
us
my
dear
sir
My
establishment
is
organised
on
simple
lines
it
is
placed
on
what
I
might
call
'a
war
footing
Come
come
Arina
Pray
calm
yourself
and
attend
to
your
duties
as
a
hostess
Oh
fie
to
give
way
in
such
a
manner
What
will
our
guest
think
of
you
My
dear
I
do
not
know
the
gentleman
's
name
the
old
lady
sobbed
through
her
tears
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
prompted
Vasili
Ivanitch
in
an
undertone
but
with
great
ceremony
Then
pray
pardon
a
foolish
old
woman
sir
Arina
Vlasievna
blew
her
nose
inclined
her
head
to
right
and
left
and
wiped
each
eye
in
turn
as
she
did
so
Yes
pray
pardon
me
but
I
had
thought
never
again
to
see
my
darling
boy
before
I
died
But
you
see
we
have
seen
him
again
said
Vasili
Ivanitch
Here
Taniushka
this
to
a
barefooted
serf
girl
of
thirteen
who
clad
in
a
bright
red
cotton
frock
had
been
an
interested
but
timid
observer
in
the
doorway
Bring
your
mistress
a
glass
of
water
on
a
salver
Do
you
hear
And
you
gentlemen
he
continued
with
old-fashioned
sprightliness
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
step
into
the
study
of
a
retired
veteran
First
another
kiss
Eniusha
gasped
Arina
Vlasievna
Then
as
Bazarov
bent
over
her
form
she
added
How
handsome
you
have
grown
Handsome
or
not
he
is
human
said
Vasili
Ivanitch
Wherefore
now
that
you
have
satisfied
your
mother
's
heart
I
look
to
you
to
see
also
to
the
satisfaction
of
our
honoured
guests
For
than
yourself
no
one
knows
better
that
nightingales
can
not
be
fed
on
air
This
caused
the
old
lady
to
rise
from
her
chair
and
to
exclaim
Yes
yes
in
one
moment
Vasili
Ivanitch
The
table
shall
be
laid
and
I
myself
will
hurry
to
the
kitchen
and
see
that
the
samovar
be
got
ready
Everything
shall
be
done
Why
it
must
be
three
years
since
last
I
gave
Eniusha
a
meal
Yes
three
years
dear
wife
But
now
bustle
about
and
do
not
let
yourself
get
flurried
Gentlemen
accompany
me
I
beg
of
you
But
here
is
Timotheitch
coming
to
pay
you
his
respects
How
delighted
he
looks
the
old
rascal
Now
pray
favour
me
with
your
company
And
he
strode
fussily
ahead
with
much
shuffling
and
creaking
of
flat-soled
slippers
The
Bazarovian
establishment
consisted
of
six
small
rooms
of
which
one
the
room
to
which
Vasili
Ivanitch
was
now
conducting
our
friends
was
looked
upon
as
the
study
Between
its
two
windows
there
stood
a
fat-legged
table
strewn
with
dusty
fusty
papers
on
the
walls
hung
a
number
of
Turkish
weapons
nagaiki
2
and
swords
a
couple
of
landscapes
a
few
anatomical
plates
a
portrait
of
Hufeland

a
black-framed
monogram
done
in
hair
and
a
diploma
protected
with
a
glass
front
between
two
large
birchwood
cupboards
stood
a
ragged
battered
leathern
sofa
on
shelves
lay
huddled
a
miscellany
of
books
boxes
stuffed
birds
jars
and
bladders
and
lastly
in
a
corner
reposed
a
broken
electric
battery
Already
I
have
warned
you
said
Vasili
Ivanitch
to
Arkady
that
we
live
here
so
to
speak
en
bivouac
Make
no
excuses
put
in
Bazarov
Kirsanov
knows
that
you
and
I
are
not
Croesuses
and
that
no
butler
is
kept
But
where
can
we
find
Arkady
a
bed
That
is
the
question
We
have
an
excellent
room
in
the
wing
where
he
would
be
most
comfortable
You
have
added
a
wing
then
Yes
Evgenii
Vasilitch
Timotheitch
interposed
At
least
a
bathroom
But
it
is
to
a
room
next
the
bathroom
that
I
am
referring
Vasili
Ivanitch
hastened
to
explain
However
that
will
not
matter
since
it
is
now
summer
time
I
will
run
up
there
at
once
and
see
that
it
is
put
in
order
Meanwhile
Timotheitch
fetch
in
the
luggage
To
you
Evgenii
I
will
allot
the
study
Cuique
suum
4
There
said
Bazarov
to
Arkady
as
soon
as
his
father
had
left
the
room
Is
he
not
just
such
a
jolly
good-hearted
queer
old
fellow
as
your
own
father
though
in
a
different
way
He
chatters
just
as
he
always
used
to
do
Yes
and
your
mother
seems
an
excellent
woman
She
is
Moreover
you
can
see
that
she
does
not
attempt
to
hide
her
feelings
Only
wait
and
see
what
a
dinner
she
will
give
us
But
as
you
were
not
expected
to-day
put
in
Timotheitch
who
had
just
re-entered
with
Bazarov
's
portmanteau
no
beef
has
been
got
into
the
house
Never
mind
Let
us
dine
without
beef
or
for
that
matter
without
anything
at
all
'Poverty
is
no
crime
How
many
souls
5
are
there
on
your
father
's
property
asked
Arkady
It
is
not
his
property
it
is
my
mother
's
The
number
of
souls
on
it
is
I
think
fifteen
No
twenty-two
corrected
Timotheitch
with
an
air
of
pride
The
next
moment
the
sound
of
shuffling
slippers
was
heard
once
more
and
Vasili
Ivanitch
re-entered
Your
room
will
be
ready
for
you
in
a
few
minutes
he
announced
grandiloquently
to
Arkady
Meanwhile
here
is
your
servant
He
pointed
to
a
close-cropped
urchin
who
clad
in
an
out-at-elbows
blue
kaftan
and
an
odd
pair
of
shoes
had
also
made
his
appearance
His
name
is
Thedika
and
for
all
my
son
's
injunction
I
had
better
repeat
to
you
not
to
expect
too
much
of
him
though
certainly
he
will
be
able
to
fill
your
pipe
for
you
I
presume
that
you
smoke
I
do
but
only
cigars
A
commendable
rule
I
too
prefer
cigars
but
find
them
extremely
difficult
to
procure
in
this
isolated
part
of
the
country
Have
done
with
bewailing
your
poverty
Bazarov
good-naturedly
interrupted
Rather
seat
yourself
on
this
sofa
and
take
a
rest
Vasili
Ivanitch
smilingly
did
as
he
was
bidden
Extremely
like
his
son
in
features
save
that
his
forehead
was
lower
and
narrower
and
his
mouth
a
trifle
wider
he
was
for
ever
on
the
move
now
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
though
his
coat
cut
him
under
the
armpits
now
blinking
now
coughing
now
twitching
his
fingers
In
this
he
was
sharply
differentiated
from
his
son
whose
most
distinguishing
characteristic
was
his
absolute
immobility
Have
done
with
bewailing
my
poverty
repeated
the
old
man
Why
you
can
not
surely
think
that
I
would
weary
our
guest
with
complaints
concerning
our
isolation
As
a
matter
of
fact
a
man
of
brains
need
never
be
isolated
and
I
myself
do
everything
in
my
power
to
avoid
becoming
moss-grown
and
falling
behind
the
times
Extracting
from
his
pocket
a
new
yellow
handkerchief
which
he
had
contrived
to
lay
hands
upon
while
proceeding
to
Arkady
's
room
he
continued
as
he
flourished
the
handkerchief
in
the
air
Of
the
fact
that
at
some
cost
to
myself
I
have
organised
my
peasantry
on
the
obrok
system
and
apportioned
them
one-half
even
more
of
my
land
I
will
not
speak
since
I
conceive
that
to
have
been
my
duty
as
well
as
a
measure
dictated
by
prudence
though
no
other
landowner
in
the
neighbourhood
would
have
done
as
much
Rather
I
am
referring
to
scholarships
and
to
science
I
see
that
you
have
here
The
Friend
of
Health
for
1855
remarked
Bazarov
Yes
a
friend
sent
it
me
Vasili
Ivanitch
hastened
to
explain
Phrenology
too
we
take
into
account
he
addressed
this
last
to
Arkady
rather
than
to
Bazarov
while
accompanying
it
with
a
nod
towards
a
small
plaster
bust
of
which
the
cranial
surface
was
divided
into
a
series
of
numbered
squares
Yes
indeed
Nor
are
we
ignorant
of
Schönlein
6
and
Rademacher
In
the
province
of
you
still
believe
in
Rademacher
queried
Bazarov
Vasili
Ivanitch
laughed
In
the
province
of
we
still
believe
in
Ah
gentlemen
Hardly
could
you
expect
us
to
move
as
fast
as
you
do
You
find
us
in
a
state
of
transition
In
my
day
the
humoralist
Hoffmann
and
the
vitalist
Braun
had
already
come
to
be
looked
upon
with
ridicule
and
their
fulminations
undoubtedly
seem
absurd
but
now
you
have
replaced
Rademacher
with
a
new
authority
and
are
making
obeisance
to
that
authority
exactly
as
though
in
twenty
years
time
he
too
will
not
have
fallen
into
contempt
Let
me
tell
you
for
your
comforting
said
Bazarov
that
we
ridicule
all
medicine
and
render
obeisance
to
no
one
What
Do
you
not
wish
to
become
a
doctor
Yes
but
the
one
thing
does
not
preclude
the
other
Vasili
Ivanitch
raked
out
his
pipe
until
only
a
glowing
morsel
of
ash
remained
Perhaps
so
perhaps
so
he
said
That
point
I
will
not
dispute
For
who
am
I
that
I
should
dispute
such
things
I
who
am
a
mere
retired
army
doctor
et
voilà
tout
an
army
doctor
who
has
taken
to
agriculture
With
that
he
turned
to
Arkady
Do
you
know
I
served
under
your
grandfather
he
said
He
was
then
in
command
of
a
brigade
Many
and
many
a
review
have
I
seen
And
the
society
in
which
I
mixed
the
men
whom
I
had
as
comrades
Yes
this
humble
individual
has
felt
the
pulses
of
Prince
Vitzentschein
and
Zhukovsky
and
also
known
all
the
leaders
of
the
Southern
Army
of
'14
He
pursed
his
lips
impressively
At
the
same
time
of
course
my
department
was
a
separate
one
from
theirs
It
was
the
department
of
the
lancet
you
understand
Your
grandfather
stood
high
in
the
esteem
of
every
one
and
was
a
true
soldier
We
will
agree
that
he
was
a
decent
old
curmudgeon
drawled
Bazarov
To
think
of
speaking
so
Evgenii
exclaimed
the
old
man
General
Kirsanov
was
not
one
of
those
who
Never
mind
him
As
we
were
driving
hither
I
greatly
admired
your
birch
plantation
It
is
doing
splendidly
Vasili
Ivanitch
's
face
brightened
instantly
Yes
and
see
what
a
garden
I
have
made
he
exclaimed
Every
tree
in
it
has
been
planted
with
my
own
hands
orchard
trees
and
bush
fruit
trees
and
every
sort
of
medicinal
herb
Ah
young
sirs
though
you
may
be
wise
in
your
generation
many
a
truth
did
old
Paracelsus
7
discover
in
herbis
et
verbis
et
lapidibus
For
myself
I
have
now
retired
from
practice
yet
twice
a
week
am
I
given
a
chance
to
refurbish
my
ancient
store
of
knowledge
since
folk
come
to
me
for
advice
and
I
can
not
well
turn
them
away
In
particular
do
the
poor
seek
my
help
since
there
is
no
other
doctor
hereabouts
Yet
stay
A
certain
retired
major
dabbles
in
the
art
Once
I
asked
him
whether
he
had
ever
studied
medicine
and
he
replied
that
he
had
not
that
all
that
he
did
he
did
'out
of
philanthropy
'Out
of
philanthropy
Ha
ha
ha
What
think
you
of
that
eh
Ha
ha
ha
Fill
me
a
pipe
Thedika
said
Bazarov
curtly
And
there
was
another
doctor
who
came
to
visit
a
patient
in
this
neighbourhood
continued
Vasili
Ivanitch
in
a
tone
of
mock
despair
But
by
the
time
he
arrived
the
patient
had
already
joined
his
forefathers
and
the
servant
of
the
house
would
not
admit
the
doctor
saying
that
the
latter
's
services
were
no
longer
required
This
the
doctor
had
scarcely
expected
and
he
was
rather
taken
aback
'Did
the
barin
gasp
before
he
died
he
inquired
'He
did
sir
was
the
reply
'Very
much
'Yes
very
much
'Good
And
the
doctor
returned
home
Ha
ha
ha
Yet
no
one
laughed
except
the
old
man
himself
True
Arkady
contrived
to
summon
up
a
smile
but
Bazarov
only
stretched
himself
and
yawned
The
conversation
lasted
about
an
hour
and
then
Arkady
managed
to
get
away
to
his
room
which
he
found
to
consist
of
the
vestibule
to
the
bathroom
but
at
the
same
time
to
be
clean
and
inviting
Soon
afterwards
Taniushka
arrived
to
announce
dinner
The
meal
though
hastily
prepared
was
excellent
and
even
sumptuous
Only
the
wine
proved
to
be
rather
of
the
gooseberry
order
the
dark-coloured
sherry
procured
by
Timotheitch
from
a
certain
wine
merchant
in
the
town
smacking
in
equal
parts
of
resin
and
of
honey
Also
in
addition
the
flies
made
themselves
a
nuisance
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
page
boy
whose
duty
it
was
to
keep
them
at
bay
with
a
green
whisk
had
for
the
nonce
been
banished
lest
he
should
excite
too
much
comment
on
the
part
of
the
up-to-date
visitors
Lastly
Arina
Vlasievna
had
robed
herself
in
gala
attire
that
is
to
say
in
a
high-peaked
cap
with
yellow
ribands
and
a
blue
embroidered
shawl
She
burst
into
renewed
weeping
on
beholding
her
beloved
Eniusha
but
this
time
gave
her
husband
no
occasion
to
chide
her
so
speedily
did
her
own
fear
of
staining
her
shawl
cause
her
to
wipe
away
the
tears
None
but
the
two
young
men
ate
anything
for
the
host
and
hostess
had
long
ago
dined
while
as
waiters
there
officiated
Thedika
much
burdened
with
the
novelty
of
wearing
shoes
and
a
woman
of
a
masculine
type
of
face
and
with
a
hump
on
her
back
who
was
also
accustomed
to
execute
the
functions
of
housekeeper
keeper
of
the
poultry
and
sempstress
During
the
meal
Vasili
Ivanitch
paced
to
and
fro
and
discussed
in
cheerful
and
even
rapturous
terms
the
grave
fears
which
Napoleon
's
8
policy
and
the
intricacy
of
the
Italian
question
inspired
in
his
breast
Arina
Vlasievna
for
her
part
quite
disregarded
Arkady
and
offered
him
not
a
single
dish
but
seated
with
her
hand
supporting
her
face
to
which
a
pair
of
puffy
cherry-coloured
lips
and
a
few
moles
communicated
a
kindly
expression
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
son
while
her
breath
came
in
a
succession
of
pants
Her
great
desire
was
to
ask
her
son
how
long
he
was
going
to
stay
but
she
dared
not
do
so
for
fear
he
should
reply
Only
for
two
days
or
something
of
the
kind
which
was
a
prospect
of
a
nature
to
make
her
heart
die
within
her
On
the
roast
being
served
Vasili
Ivanitch
disappeared
and
returned
the
next
moment
with
an
uncorked
bottle
of
champagne
See
here
he
exclaimed
Rustic
though
we
may
be
we
still
keep
something
to
make
merry
with
on
state
occasions
That
said
he
filled
three
tumblers
and
a
wine-glass
proposed
a
health
to
our
inestimable
guests
heel-tapped
his
glass
in
the
military
fashion
and
forced
his
wife
to
drain
hers
to
the
dregs
Presently
the
pastry
course
supervened
during
which
though
Arkady
could
not
bear
anything
sweet
he
deemed
it
his
duty
to
partake
of
no
less
than
four
out
of
the
many
confections
which
had
been
prepared
for
his
benefit
And
this
obligation
he
felt
to
be
the
more
binding
in
that
Bazarov
bluntly
declined
all
and
lit
a
cigar
Lastly
there
appeared
tea
cream
biscuits
and
butter
after
which
Vasili
Ivanitch
conducted
the
party
into
the
garden
in
order
that
the
guests
might
admire
the
beauty
of
the
evening
As
he
passed
a
certain
bench
he
whispered
in
Arkady's
ear
This
is
where
I
love
to
sit
and
meditate
as
I
watch
the
sun
sinking
It
is
just
the
spot
for
a
hermit
like
myself
And
further
on
I
have
planted
a
few
of
Horace
's
favourite
trees
What
trees
asked
Bazarov
who
had
partially
overheard
Acacia
trees
The
other
yawned
and
on
observing
this
Vasili
Ivanitch
hastened
to
say
I
expect
that
you
travellers
would
like
now
to
seek
the
arms
of
Morpheus
We
should
Bazarov
assented
Yes
that
is
a
true
saying
Upon
which
the
son
said
Good
night
to
his
mother
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
while
she
bestowed
upon
him
a
threefold
embrace
and
covertly
a
blessing
while
Vasili
Ivanitch
conducted
Arkady
to
his
room
and
wished
him
such
God-given
rest
as
I
myself
used
to
enjoy
during
the
happier
years
of
my
life
And
certainly
Arkady
slept
splendidly
in
the
mint-scented
annexe
to
the
bathroom
where
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
was
that
of
a
cricket
chirping
lustily
against
a
rival
from
behind
the
stove
Meanwhile
on
leaving
Arkady
Vasili
Ivanitch
repaired
to
the
study
where
squatting
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
he
was
about
to
enter
into
a
discursive
conversation
with
his
son
when
the
latter
dismissed
him
on
the
plea
that
he
desired
rather
to
go
to
sleep
Yet
never
once
did
Bazarov
close
his
eyes
that
night
but
lay
staring
into
the
darkness
since
his
memories
of
childhood
had
less
power
to
move
him
than
had
the
remembrance
of
the
bitter
experience
through
which
he
had
recently
passed
For
her
part
Arina
Vlasievna
said
her
prayers
with
an
overflowing
heart
and
then
indulged
in
a
long
talk
with
Anfisushka
who
planted
like
a
block
before
her
mistress
with
her
solitary
eye
fixed
upon
the
latter
communicated
in
a
