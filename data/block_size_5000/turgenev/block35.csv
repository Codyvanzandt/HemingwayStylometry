used
to
hang
in
my
mother
's
bedroom
and
very
hideous
he
was
in
a
red
uniform
with
a
black
collar
up
to
his
ears
They
used
to
take
me
to
be
whipped
before
him
and
my
mother
used
always
on
such
occasions
to
point
to
him
saying
He
would
give
it
to
you
much
more
if
he
were
here
You
can
imagine
what
an
encouraging
effect
that
had
on
me
I
had
no
brother
nor
sister
that's
to
say
speaking
accurately
I
had
once
had
a
brother
knocking
about
with
the
English
disease
in
his
neck
but
he
soon
died
And
why
ever
one
wonders
should
the
English
disease
make
its
way
to
the
Shtchigri
district
of
the
province
of
Kursk
But
that
's
neither
here
nor
there
My
mother
undertook
my
education
with
all
the
vigorous
zeal
of
a
country
lady
of
the
steppes
she
undertook
it
from
the
solemn
day
of
my
birth
till
the
time
when
my
sixteenth
year
had
come
You
are
following
my
story
'Yes
please
go
on
'All
right
Well
when
I
was
sixteen
my
mother
promptly
dismissed
my
teacher
of
French
a
German
Filip
vitch
from
the
Greek
settlement
of
Nyezhin
She
conducted
me
to
Moscow
put
down
my
name
for
the
university
and
gave
up
her
soul
to
the
Almighty
leaving
me
in
the
hands
of
my
uncle
the
attorney
Koltun-Babur
one
of
a
sort
well-known
not
only
in
the
Shtchigri
district
My
uncle
the
attorney
Koltun-Babur
plundered
me
to
the
last
half-penny
after
the
custom
of
guardians
But
again
that
's
neither
here
nor
there
I
entered
the
university
I
must
do
so
much
justice
to
my
mother
rather
well
grounded
but
my
lack
of
originality
was
even
then
apparent
My
childhood
was
in
no
way
distinguished
from
the
childhood
of
other
boys
I
grew
up
just
as
languidly
and
dully
much
as
if
I
were
under
a
feather-bed
just
as
early
I
began
repeating
poetry
by
heart
and
moping
under
the
pretence
of
a
dreamy
inclination
for
what
why
for
the
beautiful
and
so
on
In
the
university
I
went
on
in
the
same
way
I
promptly
got
into
a
circle
Times
were
different
then
But
you
do
n't
know
perhaps
what
sort
of
thing
a
student
's
circle
is
I
remember
Schiller
said
somewhere
Gef
hrlich
ist
's
den
Leu
zu
wecken
Und
schrecklich
ist
des
Tigers
Zahn
Doch
das
schrecklichste
der
Schrecken
Das
ist
der
Mensch
in
seinem
Wahn
He
did
n't
mean
that
I
can
assure
you
he
meant
to
say
Das
ist
ein
circle
in
der
Stadt
Moskau
'But
what
do
you
find
so
awful
in
the
circle
I
asked
My
neighbour
snatched
his
cap
and
pulled
it
down
on
to
his
nose
'What
do
I
find
so
awful
he
shouted
'Why
this
the
circle
is
the
destruction
of
all
independent
development
the
circle
is
a
hideous
substitute
for
society
woman
life
the
circle
oh
wait
a
bit
I'll
tell
you
what
a
circle
is
A
circle
is
a
slothful
dull
living
side
by
side
in
common
to
which
is
attached
a
serious
significance
and
a
show
of
rational
activity
the
circle
replaces
conversation
by
debate
trains
you
in
fruitless
discussion
draws
you
away
from
solitary
useful
labour
develops
in
you
the
itch
for
authorship
deprives
you
in
fact
of
all
freshness
and
virgin
vigour
of
soul
The
circle
why
it's
vulgarity
and
boredom
under
the
name
of
brotherhood
and
friendship
a
concatenation
of
misunderstandings
and
cavillings
under
the
pretence
of
openness
and
sympathy
in
the
circle
thanks
to
the
right
of
every
friend
at
all
hours
and
seasons
to
poke
his
unwashed
fingers
into
the
very
inmost
soul
of
his
comrade
no
one
has
a
single
spot
in
his
soul
pure
and
undefiled
in
the
circle
they
fall
down
before
the
shallow
vain
smart
talker
and
the
premature
wise-acre
and
worship
the
rhymester
with
no
poetic
gift
but
full
of
subtle
ideas
in
the
circle
young
lads
of
seventeen
talk
glibly
and
learnedly
of
women
and
of
love
while
in
the
presence
of
women
they
are
dumb
or
talk
to
them
like
a
book
and
what
do
they
talk
about
The
circle
is
the
hot-bed
of
glib
fluency
in
the
circle
they
spy
on
one
another
like
so
many
police
officials
Oh
circle
thou'rt
not
a
circle
but
an
enchanted
ring
which
has
been
the
ruin
of
many
a
decent
fellow
'Come
you
're
exaggerating
allow
me
to
observe
I
broke
in
My
neighbour
looked
at
me
in
silence
'Perhaps
God
knows
perhaps
But
you
see
there
's
only
one
pleasure
left
your
humble
servant
and
that
's
exaggeration
well
that
was
the
way
I
spent
four
years
in
Moscow
I
ca
n't
tell
you
my
dear
sir
how
quickly
how
fearfully
quickly
that
time
passed
it
's
positively
painful
and
vexatious
to
remember
Some
mornings
one
gets
up
and
it's
like
sliding
downhill
on
little
sledges
Before
one
can
look
round
one
's
flown
to
the
bottom
it
's
evening
already
and
already
the
sleepy
servant
is
pulling
on
one
's
coat
one
dresses
and
trails
off
to
a
friend
and
may
be
smokes
a
pipe
drinks
weak
tea
in
glasses
and
discusses
German
philosophy
love
the
eternal
sunshine
of
the
spirit
and
other
far-fetched
topics
But
even
there
I
met
original
independent
people
however
some
men
stultify
themselves
and
warp
themselves
out
of
shape
still
nature
asserts
itself
I
alone
poor
wretch
moulded
myself
like
soft
wax
and
my
pitiful
little
nature
never
made
the
faintest
resistance
Meantime
I
had
reached
my
twenty-first
year
I
came
into
possession
of
my
inheritance
or
more
correctly
speaking
that
part
of
my
inheritance
which
my
guardian
had
thought
fit
to
leave
me
gave
a
freed
house-serf
Vassily
Kudryashev
a
warranty
to
superintend
all
my
patrimony
and
set
off
abroad
to
Berlin
I
was
abroad
as
I
have
already
had
the
pleasure
of
telling
you
three
years
Well
There
too
abroad
too
I
remained
the
same
unoriginal
creature
In
the
first
place
I
need
not
say
that
of
Europe
of
European
life
I
really
learnt
nothing
I
listened
to
German
professors
and
read
German
books
on
their
birthplace
that
was
all
the
difference
I
led
as
solitary
a
life
as
any
monk
I
got
on
good
terms
with
a
retired
lieutenant
weighed
down
like
myself
by
a
thirst
for
knowledge
but
always
dull
of
comprehension
and
not
gifted
with
a
flow
of
words
I
made
friends
with
slow-witted
families
from
Penza
and
other
agricultural
provinces
hung
about
caf
s
read
the
papers
in
the
evening
went
to
the
theatre
With
the
natives
I
associated
very
little
I
talked
to
them
with
constraint
and
never
had
one
of
them
to
see
me
at
my
own
place
except
two
or
three
intrusive
fellows
of
Jewish
extraction
who
were
constantly
running
in
upon
me
and
borrowing
money
thanks
to
der
Russe's
gullibility
A
strange
freak
of
chance
brought
me
at
last
to
the
house
of
one
of
my
professors
It
was
like
this
I
came
to
him
to
enter
my
name
for
a
course
of
lectures
and
he
all
of
a
sudden
invited
me
to
an
evening
party
at
his
house
This
professor
had
two
daughters
of
twenty-seven
such
stumpy
little
things
God
bless
them
with
such
majestic
noses
frizzed
curls
and
pale-blue
eyes
and
red
hands
with
white
nails
One
was
called
Linchen
and
the
other
Minchen
I
began
to
go
to
the
professor
's
I
ought
to
tell
you
that
the
professor
was
not
exactly
stupid
but
seemed
as
it
were
dazed
in
his
professorial
desk
he
spoke
fairly
consecutively
but
at
home
he
lisped
and
always
had
his
spectacles
on
his
forehead
he
was
a
very
learned
man
though
Well
suddenly
it
seemed
to
me
that
I
was
in
love
with
Linchen
and
for
six
whole
months
this
impression
remained
I
talked
to
her
it
's
true
very
little
it
was
more
that
I
looked
at
her
but
I
used
to
read
various
touching
passages
aloud
to
her
to
press
her
hand
on
the
sly
and
to
dream
beside
her
in
the
evenings
gazing
persistently
at
the
moon
or
else
simply
up
aloft
Besides
she
made
such
delicious
coffee
One
asks
oneself
what
more
could
one
desire
Only
one
thing
troubled
me
at
the
very
moments
of
ineffable
bliss
as
it
's
called
I
always
had
a
sort
of
sinking
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
and
a
cold
shudder
ran
down
my
back
At
last
I
could
not
stand
such
happiness
and
ran
away
Two
whole
years
after
that
I
was
abroad
I
went
to
Italy
stood
before
the
Transfiguration
in
Rome
and
before
the
Venus
in
Florence
and
suddenly
fell
into
exaggerated
raptures
as
though
an
attack
of
delirium
had
come
upon
me
in
the
evenings
I
wrote
verses
began
a
diary
in
fact
there
too
I
behaved
just
like
everyone
else
And
just
mark
how
easy
it
is
to
be
original
I
take
no
interest
for
instance
in
painting
and
sculpture
But
simply
saying
so
aloud
no
it
was
impossible
I
must
needs
take
a
cicerone
and
run
to
gaze
at
the
frescoes
He
looked
down
again
and
again
pulled
off
his
nightcap
'Well
I
came
back
to
my
own
country
at
last
he
went
on
in
a
weary
voice
'I
went
to
Moscow
In
Moscow
a
marvellous
transformation
took
place
in
me
Abroad
I
was
mostly
silent
but
now
suddenly
I
began
to
talk
with
unexpected
smartness
and
at
the
same
time
I
began
to
conceive
all
sorts
of
ideas
of
myself
There
were
kindly
disposed
persons
to
be
found
to
whom
I
seemed
all
but
a
genius
ladies
listened
sympathetically
to
my
diatribes
but
I
was
not
able
to
keep
on
the
summit
of
my
glory
One
fine
morning
a
slander
sprang
up
about
me
who
had
originated
it
I
do
n't
know
it
must
have
been
some
old
maid
of
the
male
sex
there
are
any
number
of
such
old
maids
in
Moscow
it
sprang
up
and
began
to
throw
off
outshoots
and
tendrils
like
a
strawberry
plant
I
was
abashed
tried
to
get
out
of
it
to
break
through
its
clinging
toils
that
was
no
good
I
went
away
Well
in
that
too
I
showed
that
I
was
an
absurd
person
I
ought
to
have
calmly
waited
for
the
storm
to
blow
over
just
as
one
waits
for
the
end
of
nettle-rash
and
the
same
kindly-disposed
persons
would
have
opened
their
arms
to
me
again
the
same
ladies
would
have
smiled
approvingly
again
at
my
remarks
But
what
's
wrong
is
just
that
I
'm
not
an
original
person
Conscientious
scruples
please
to
observe
had
been
stirred
up
in
me
I
was
somehow
ashamed
of
talk
talk
without
ceasing
nothing
but
talk
yesterday
in
Arbat
to-day
in
Truba
to-morrow
in
Sivtsevy-Vrazhky
and
all
about
the
same
thing
But
if
that
is
what
people
want
of
me
Look
at
the
really
successful
men
in
that
line
they
do
n't
ask
its
use
on
the
contrary
it
's
all
they
need
some
will
keep
their
tongues
wagging
twenty
years
together
and
always
in
one
direction
That
's
what
comes
of
self-confidence
and
conceit
I
had
that
too
conceit
indeed
even
now
it
's
not
altogether
stifled
But
what
was
wrong
was
that
I
say
again
I
'm
not
an
original
person
I
stopped
midway
nature
ought
to
have
given
me
far
more
conceit
or
none
at
all
But
at
first
I
felt
the
change
a
very
hard
one
moreover
my
stay
abroad
too
had
utterly
drained
my
resources
while
I
was
not
disposed
to
marry
a
merchant
's
daughter
young
but
flabby
as
a
jelly
so
I
retired
to
my
country
place
I
fancy
added
my
neighbour
with
another
glance
sideways
at
me
'I
may
pass
over
in
silence
the
first
impressions
of
country
life
references
to
the
beauty
of
nature
the
gentle
charm
of
solitude
etc
'You
can
indeed
I
put
in
'All
the
more
he
continued
'as
all
that
's
nonsense
at
least
as
far
as
I
'm
concerned
I
was
as
bored
in
the
country
as
a
puppy
locked
up
though
I
will
own
that
on
my
journey
home
when
I
passed
through
the
familiar
birchwood
in
spring
for
the
first
time
my
head
was
in
a
whirl
and
my
heart
beat
with
a
vague
sweet
expectation
But
these
vague
expectations
as
you
're
well
aware
never
come
to
pass
on
the
other
hand
very
different
things
do
come
to
pass
which
you
do
n't
at
all
expect
such
as
cattle
disease
arrears
sales
by
auction
and
so
on
and
so
on
I
managed
to
make
a
shift
from
day
to
day
with
the
aid
of
my
agent
Yakov
who
replaced
the
former
superintendent
and
turned
out
in
the
course
of
time
to
be
as
great
if
not
a
greater
robber
and
over
and
above
that
poisoned
my
existence
by
the
smell
of
his
tarred
boots
suddenly
one
day
I
remembered
a
family
I
knew
in
the
neighbourhood
consisting
of
the
widow
of
a
retired
colonel
and
her
two
daughters
ordered
out
my
droshky
and
set
off
to
see
them
That
day
must
always
be
a
memorable
one
for
me
six
months
later
I
was
married
to
the
retired
colonel
's
second
daughter
The
speaker
dropped
his
head
and
lifted
his
hands
to
heaven
'And
now
he
went
on
warmly
'I
could
n't
bear
to
give
you
an
unfavourable
opinion
of
my
late
wife
Heaven
forbid
She
was
the
most
generous
sweetest
creature
a
loving
nature
capable
of
any
sacrifice
though
I
must
between
ourselves
confess
that
if
I
had
not
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
her
I
should
probably
not
be
in
a
position
to
be
talking
to
you
to-day
since
the
beam
is
still
there
in
my
barn
to
which
I
repeatedly
made
up
my
mind
to
hang
myself
'Some
pears
he
began
again
after
a
brief
pause
'need
to
lie
in
an
underground
cellar
for
a
time
to
come
as
they
say
to
their
real
flavour
my
wife
it
seems
belonged
to
a
similar
order
of
nature's
works
It
's
only
now
that
I
do
her
complete
justice
It
's
only
now
for
instance
that
memories
of
some
evenings
I
spent
with
her
before
marriage
no
longer
awaken
the
slightest
bitterness
but
move
me
almost
to
tears
They
were
not
rich
people
their
house
was
very
old-fashioned
and
built
of
wood
but
comfortable
it
stood
on
a
hill
between
an
overgrown
courtyard
and
a
garden
run
wild
At
the
bottom
of
the
hill
ran
a
river
which
could
just
be
seen
through
the
thick
leaves
A
wide
terrace
led
from
the
house
to
the
garden
before
the
terrace
flaunted
a
long
flower-bed
covered
with
roses
at
each
end
of
the
flower-bed
grew
two
acacias
which
had
been
trained
to
grow
into
the
shape
of
a
screw
by
its
late
owner
A
little
farther
in
the
very
midst
of
a
thicket
of
neglected
and
overgrown
raspberries
stood
an
arbour
smartly
painted
within
but
so
old
and
tumble-down
outside
that
it
was
depressing
to
look
at
it
A
glass
door
led
from
the
terrace
into
the
drawing-room
in
the
drawing-room
this
was
what
met
the
eye
of
the
inquisitive
spectator
in
the
various
corners
stoves
of
Dutch
tiles
a
squeaky
piano
to
the
right
piled
with
manuscript
music
a
sofa
covered
with
faded
blue
material
with
a
whitish
pattern
a
round
table
two
what-nots
of
china
and
glass
knicknacks
of
the
Catherine
period
on
the
wall
the
well-known
picture
of
a
flaxen-haired
girl
with
a
dove
on
her
breast
and
eyes
turned
upwards
on
the
table
a
vase
of
fresh
roses
You
see
how
minutely
I
describe
it
In
that
drawing-room
on
that
terrace
was
rehearsed
all
the
tragi-comedy
of
my
love
The
colonel
's
wife
herself
was
an
ill-natured
old
dame
whose
voice
was
always
hoarse
with
spite
a
petty
snappish
creature
Of
the
daughters
one
Vera
did
not
differ
in
any
respect
from
the
common
run
of
young
ladies
of
the
provinces
the
other
Sofya
I
fell
in
love
with
The
two
sisters
had
another
little
room
too
their
common
bedroom
with
two
innocent
little
wooden
bedsteads
yellowish
albums
mignonette
portraits
of
friends
sketched
in
pencil
rather
badly
among
them
was
one
gentleman
with
an
exceptionally
vigorous
expression
of
face
and
a
still
more
vigorous
signature
who
had
in
his
youth
raised
disproportionate
expectations
but
had
come
like
all
of
us
to
nothing
with
busts
of
Goethe
and
Schiller
German
books
dried
wreaths
and
other
objects
kept
as
souvenirs
But
that
room
I
rarely
and
reluctantly
entered
I
felt
stifled
there
somehow
And
too
strange
to
say
I
liked
Sofya
best
of
all
when
I
was
sitting
with
my
back
to
her
or
still
more
perhaps
when
I
was
thinking
or
dreaming
about
her
in
the
evening
on
the
terrace
At
such
times
I
used
to
gaze
at
the
sunset
at
the
trees
at
the
tiny
leaves
already
in
darkness
but
standing
out
sharply
against
the
rosy
sky
in
the
drawing-room
Sofya
sat
at
the
piano
continually
playing
over
and
over
again
some
favourite
passionately
pathetic
phrase
from
Beethoven
the
ill-natured
old
lady
snored
peacefully
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
the
dining-room
which
was
flooded
by
a
glow
of
lurid
light
Vera
was
bustling
about
getting
tea
the
samovar
hissed
merrily
as
though
it
were
pleased
at
something
the
cracknels
snapped
with
a
pleasant
crispness
and
the
spoons
tinkled
against
the
cups
the
canary
which
trilled
mercilessly
all
day
was
suddenly
still
and
only
chirruped
from
time
to
time
as
though
asking
for
something
from
a
light
transparent
cloud
there
fell
a
few
passing
drops
of
rain
And
I
would
sit
and
sit
listen
listen
and
look
my
heart
would
expand
and
again
it
seemed
to
me
that
I
was
in
love
Well
under
the
influence
of
such
an
evening
I
one
day
asked
the
old
lady
for
her
daughter
's
hand
and
two
months
later
I
was
married
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
loved
her
By
now
indeed
it
's
time
I
should
know
but
by
God
even
now
I
don't
know
whether
I
loved
Sofya
She
was
a
sweet
creature
clever
silent
and
warm-hearted
but
God
only
knows
from
what
cause
whether
from
living
too
long
in
the
country
or
for
some
other
reason
there
was
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
if
only
there
is
a
bottom
to
the
heart
a
secret
wound
or
to
put
it
better
a
little
open
sore
which
nothing
could
heal
to
which
neither
she
nor
I
could
give
a
name
Of
the
existence
of
this
sore
of
course
I
only
guessed
after
marriage
The
struggles
I
had
over
it
nothing
availed
When
I
was
a
child
I
had
a
little
bird
which
had
once
been
caught
by
the
cat
in
its
claws
it
was
saved
and
tended
but
the
poor
bird
never
got
right
it
moped
it
pined
it
ceased
to
sing
It
ended
by
a
cat
getting
into
its
open
cage
one
night
and
biting
off
its
beak
after
which
it
made
up
its
mind
at
last
to
die
I
do
n't
know
what
cat
had
caught
my
wife
in
its
claws
but
she
too
moped
and
pined
just
like
my
unlucky
bird
Sometimes
she
obviously
made
an
effort
to
shake
herself
to
rejoice
in
the
open
air
in
the
sunshine
and
freedom
she
would
try
and
shrink
up
into
herself
again
And
you
know
she
loved
me
how
many
times
has
she
assured
me
that
she
had
nothing
left
to
wish
for
oof
damn
my
soul
and
the
light
was
fading
out
of
her
eyes
all
the
while
I
wondered
whether
there
hadn't
been
something
in
her
past
I
made
investigations
there
was
nothing
forthcoming
Well
you
may
form
your
own
judgment
an
original
man
would
have
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
heaved
a
sigh
or
two
perhaps
and
would
have
proceeded
to
live
his
own
life
but
I
not
being
an
original
creature
began
to
contemplate
a
beam
and
halter
My
wife
was
so
thoroughly
permeated
by
all
the
habits
of
an
old
maid
Beethoven
evening
walks
mignonette
corresponding
with
her
friends
albums
et
cetera
that
she
never
could
accustom
herself
to
any
other
mode
of
life
especially
to
the
life
of
the
mistress
of
a
house
and
yet
it
seemed
absurd
for
a
married
woman
to
be
pining
in
vague
melancholy
and
singing
in
the
evening
Waken
her
not
at
the
dawn
'Well
we
were
blissful
after
that
fashion
for
three
years
in
the
fourth
Sofya
died
in
her
first
confinement
and
strange
to
say
I
had
felt
as
it
were
beforehand
that
she
would
not
be
capable
of
giving
me
a
daughter
or
a
son
of
giving
the
earth
a
new
inhabitant
I
remember
how
they
buried
her
It
was
in
the
spring
Our
parish
church
was
small
and
old
the
screen
was
blackened
the
walls
bare
the
brick
floor
worn
into
hollows
in
parts
there
was
a
big
old-fashioned
holy
picture
in
each
half
of
the
choir
They
brought
in
the
coffin
placed
it
in
the
middle
before
the
holy
gates
covered
it
with
a
faded
pall
set
three
candlesticks
about
it
The
service
commenced
A
decrepit
deacon
with
a
little
shock
of
hair
behind
belted
low
down
with
a
green
kerchief
was
mournfully
mumbling
before
a
reading-desk
a
priest
also
an
old
man
with
a
kindly
purblind
face
in
a
lilac
cassock
with
yellow
flowers
on
it
served
the
mass
for
himself
and
the
deacon
At
all
the
open
windows
the
fresh
young
leaves
were
stirring
and
whispering
and
the
smell
of
the
grass
rose
from
the
churchyard
outside
the
red
flame
of
the
wax-candles
paled
in
the
bright
light
of
the
spring
day
the
sparrows
were
twittering
all
over
the
church
and
every
now
and
then
there
came
the
ringing
cry
of
a
swallow
flying
in
under
the
cupola
In
the
golden
motes
of
the
sunbeams
the
brown
heads
of
the
few
peasants
kept
rising
and
dropping
down
again
as
they
prayed
earnestly
for
the
dead
in
a
thin
bluish
stream
the
smoke
issued
from
the
holes
of
the
censer
I
looked
at
the
dead
face
of
my
wife
My
God
even
death
death
itself
had
not
set
her
free
had
not
healed
her
wound
the
same
sickly
timid
dumb
look
as
though
even
in
her
coffin
she
were
ill
at
ease
My
heart
was
filled
with
bitterness
A
sweet
sweet
creature
she
was
and
she
did
well
for
herself
to
die
The
speaker
's
cheeks
flushed
and
his
eyes
grew
dim
'When
at
last
he
began
again
'I
emerged
from
the
deep
depression
which
overwhelmed
me
after
my
wife
's
death
I
resolved
to
devote
myself
as
it
is
called
to
work
I
went
into
a
government
office
in
the
capital
of
the
province
but
in
the
great
apartments
of
the
government
institution
my
head
ached
and
my
eyesight
too
began
to
fail
other
incidental
causes
came
in
I
retired
I
had
thought
of
going
on
a
visit
to
Moscow
but
in
the
first
place
I
had
n't
the
money
and
secondly
I
've
told
you
already
I
'm
resigned
This
resignation
came
upon
me
both
suddenly
and
not
suddenly
In
spirit
I
had
long
ago
resigned
myself
but
my
brain
was
still
unwilling
to
accept
the
yoke
I
ascribed
my
humble
temper
and
ideas
to
the
influence
of
country
life
and
happiness
On
the
other
side
I
had
long
observed
that
all
my
neighbours
young
and
old
alike
who
had
been
frightened
at
first
by
my
learning
my
residence
abroad
and
my
other
advantages
of
education
had
not
only
had
time
to
get
completely
used
to
me
but
had
even
begun
to
treat
me
half-rudely
half-contemptuously
did
not
listen
to
my
observations
and
in
talking
to
me
no
longer
made
use
of
superfluous
signs
of
respect
I
forgot
to
tell
you
too
that
during
the
first
year
after
my
marriage
I
had
tried
to
launch
into
literature
and
even
sent
a
thing
to
a
journal
a
story
if
I
'm
not
mistaken
but
in
a
little
time
I
received
a
polite
letter
from
the
editor
in
which
among
other
things
I
was
told
that
he
could
not
deny
I
had
intelligence
but
he
was
obliged
to
say
I
had
no
talent
and
talent
alone
was
what
was
needed
in
literature
To
add
to
this
it
came
to
my
knowledge
that
a
young
man
on
a
visit
from
Moscow
a
most
good-natured
youth
too
had
referred
to
me
at
an
evening
party
at
the
governor
's
as
a
shallow
person
antiquated
and
behind
the
times
But
my
half-wilful
blindness
still
persisted
I
was
unwilling
to
give
myself
a
slap
in
the
face
you
know
at
last
one
fine
morning
my
eyes
were
opened
This
was
how
it
happened
The
district
captain
of
police
came
to
see
me
with
the
object
of
calling
my
attention
to
a
tumble-down
bridge
on
my
property
which
I
had
absolutely
no
money
to
repair
After
consuming
a
glass
of
vodka
and
a
snack
of
dried
fish
this
condescending
guardian
of
order
reproached
me
in
a
paternal
way
for
my
heedlessness
sympathising
however
with
my
position
and
only
advising
me
to
order
my
peasants
to
patch
up
the
bridge
with
some
rubbish
he
lighted
a
pipe
and
began
talking
of
the
coming
elections
A
candidate
for
the
honourable
post
of
marshal
of
the
province
was
at
that
time
one
Orbassanov
a
noisy
shallow
fellow
who
took
bribes
into
the
bargain
Besides
he
was
not
distinguished
either
for
wealth
or
for
family
I
expressed
my
opinion
with
regard
to
him
and
rather
casually
too
I
regarded
Mr
Orbassanov
I
must
own
as
beneath
my
level
The
police-captain
looked
at
me
patted
me
amicably
on
the
shoulder
and
said
good-naturedly
Come
come
Vassily
Vassilyevitch
it
's
not
for
you
and
me
to
criticise
men
like
that
how
are
we
qualified
to
Let
the
shoemaker
stick
to
his
last
But
upon
my
word
I
retorted
with
annoyance
whatever
difference
is
there
between
me
and
Mr
Orbassanov
The
police-captain
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
fairly
roared
Well
you
're
an
amusing
chap
he
observed
at
last
while
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
what
a
joke
to
make
Ah
you
are
a
funny
fellow
And
till
his
departure
he
never
ceased
jeering
at
me
now
and
then
giving
me
a
poke
in
the
ribs
with
his
elbow
and
addressing
me
by
my
Christian
name
He
went
away
at
last
This
was
enough
it
was
the
last
drop
and
my
cup
was
overflowing
I
paced
several
times
up
and
down
the
room
stood
still
before
the
looking-glass
and
gazed
a
long
long
while
at
my
embarrassed
countenance
and
deliberately
putting
out
my
tongue
I
shook
my
head
with
a
bitter
smile
The
scales
fell
from
my
eyes
I
saw
clearly
more
clearly
than
I
saw
my
face
in
the
glass
what
a
shallow
insignificant
worthless
unoriginal
person
I
was
He
paused
'In
one
of
Voltaire
's
tragedies
he
went
on
wearily
'there
is
some
worthy
who
rejoices
that
he
has
reached
the
furthest
limit
of
unhappiness
Though
there
is
nothing
tragic
in
my
fate
I
will
admit
I
have
experienced
something
of
that
sort
I
have
known
the
bitter
transports
of
cold
despair
I
have
felt
how
sweet
it
is
lying
in
bed
to
curse
deliberately
for
a
whole
morning
together
the
hour
and
day
of
my
birth
I
could
not
resign
myself
all
at
once
And
indeed
think
of
it
yourself
I
was
kept
by
impecuniosity
in
the
country
which
I
hated
I
was
not
fitted
for
managing
my
land
nor
for
the
public
service
nor
for
literature
nor
anything
my
neighbours
I
did
n't
care
for
and
books
I
loathed
as
for
the
mawkish
and
morbidly
sentimental
young
ladies
who
shake
their
curls
and
feverishly
harp
on
the
word
life
I
had
ceased
to
have
any
attraction
for
them
ever
since
I
gave
up
ranting
and
gushing
complete
solitude
I
could
not
face
I
began
what
do
you
suppose
I
began
hanging
about
visiting
my
neighbours
As
though
drunk
with
self-contempt
I
purposely
exposed
myself
to
all
sorts
of
petty
slights
I
was
missed
over
in
serving
at
table
I
was
met
with
supercilious
coldness
and
at
last
was
not
noticed
at
all
I
was
not
even
allowed
to
take
part
in
general
conversation
and
from
my
corner
I
myself
used
purposely
to
back
up
some
stupid
talker
who
in
those
days
at
Moscow
would
have
ecstatically
licked
the
dust
off
my
feet
and
kissed
the
hem
of
my
cloak
I
did
not
even
allow
myself
to
believe
that
I
was
enjoying
the
bitter
satisfaction
of
irony
What
sort
of
irony
indeed
can
a
man
enjoy
in
solitude
Well
so
I
have
behaved
for
some
years
on
end
and
so
I
behave
now
'Really
this
is
beyond
everything
grumbled
the
sleepy
voice
of
Mr
Kantagryuhin
from
the
next
room
'what
fool
is
it
that
has
taken
a
fancy
to
talk
all
night
The
speaker
promptly
ducked
under
the
clothes
and
peeping
out
timidly
held
up
his
finger
to
me
warningly
'Sh
sh
he
whispered
and
as
it
were
bowing
apologetically
in
the
direction
of
Kantagryuhin
's
voice
he
said
respectfully
'I
obey
sir
I
obey
I
beg
your
pardon
It
's
permissible
for
him
to
sleep
he
ought
to
sleep
he
went
on
again
in
a
whisper
'he
must
recruit
his
energies
well
if
only
to
eat
his
dinner
with
the
same
relish
to-morrow
We
have
no
right
to
disturb
him
Besides
I
think
I
've
told
you
all
I
wanted
to
probably
you
're
sleepy
too
I
wish
you
good-night
He
turned
away
with
feverish
rapidity
and
buried
his
head
in
the
pillow
'Let
me
at
least
know
