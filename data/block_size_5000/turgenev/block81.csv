no
more
A
picture
had
somehow
come
into
his
hands
representing
a
burning
candle
which
the
winds
with
puffed-out
cheeks
were
blowing
upon
from
all
sides
below
was
the
inscription
Such
is
the
life
of
man
He
was
very
fond
of
this
picture
he
had
hung
it
up
in
his
own
room
but
at
ordinary
not
melancholy
times
he
used
to
keep
it
turned
face
to
the
wall
so
that
it
might
not
depress
him
Harlov
that
colossus
was
afraid
of
death
To
the
consolations
of
religion
to
prayer
however
he
rarely
had
recourse
in
his
fits
of
melancholy
Even
then
he
chiefly
relied
on
his
own
intelligence
He
had
no
particular
religious
feeling
he
was
not
often
seen
in
church
he
used
to
say
it
is
true
that
he
did
not
go
on
the
ground
that
owing
to
his
corporeal
dimensions
he
was
afraid
of
squeezing
other
people
out
The
fit
of
depression
commonly
ended
in
Martin
Petrovitch
s
beginning
to
whistle
and
suddenly
in
a
voice
of
thunder
ordering
out
his
droshky
and
dashing
off
about
the
neighbourhood
vigorously
brandishing
his
disengaged
hand
over
the
peak
of
his
cap
as
though
he
would
say
For
all
that
I
don
t
care
a
straw
He
was
a
regular
Russian
Strong
men
like
Martin
Petrovitch
are
for
the
most
part
of
a
phlegmatic
disposition
but
he
on
the
contrary
was
rather
easily
irritated
He
was
specially
short-tempered
with
a
certain
Bitchkov
who
had
found
a
refuge
in
our
house
where
he
occupied
a
position
between
that
of
a
buffoon
and
a
dependant
He
was
the
brother
of
Harlov
s
deceased
wife
had
been
nicknamed
Souvenir
as
a
little
boy
and
Souvenir
he
had
remained
for
every
one
even
the
servants
who
addressed
him
it
is
true
as
Souvenir
Timofeitch
His
real
name
he
seemed
hardly
to
know
himself
He
was
a
pitiful
creature
looked
down
upon
by
every
one
a
toady
in
fact
He
had
no
teeth
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
which
gave
his
little
wrinkled
face
a
crooked
appearance
He
was
in
a
perpetual
fuss
and
fidget
he
used
to
poke
himself
into
the
maids
room
or
into
the
counting-house
or
into
the
priest
s
quarters
or
else
into
the
bailiff
s
hut
He
was
repelled
from
everywhere
but
he
only
shrugged
himself
up
and
screwed
up
his
little
eyes
and
laughed
a
pitiful
mawkish
laugh
like
the
sound
of
rinsing
a
bottle
It
always
seemed
to
me
that
had
Souvenir
had
money
he
would
have
turned
into
the
basest
person
unprincipled
spiteful
even
cruel
Poverty
kept
him
within
bounds
He
was
only
allowed
drink
on
holidays
He
was
decently
dressed
by
my
mother
s
orders
since
in
the
evenings
he
took
a
hand
in
her
game
of
picquet
or
boston
Souvenir
was
constantly
repeating
Certainly
d
rectly
d
rectly
D
rectly
what
my
mother
would
ask
with
annoyance
He
instantly
drew
back
his
hands
in
a
scare
and
lisped
At
your
service
ma
am
Listening
at
doors
backbiting
and
above
all
quizzing
teasing
were
his
sole
interest
and
he
used
to
quiz
as
though
he
had
a
right
to
as
though
he
were
avenging
himself
for
something
He
used
to
call
Martin
Petrovitch
brother
and
tormented
him
beyond
endurance
What
made
you
kill
my
sister
Margarita
Timofeevna
he
used
to
persist
wriggling
about
before
him
and
sniggering
One
day
Martin
Petrovitch
was
sitting
in
the
billiard-room
a
cool
apartment
in
which
no
one
had
ever
seen
a
single
fly
and
which
our
neighbour
disliking
heat
and
sunshine
greatly
favoured
on
this
account
He
was
sitting
between
the
wall
and
the
billiard-table
Souvenir
was
fidgeting
before
his
bulky
person
mocking
him
grimacing
Martin
Petrovitch
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
and
thrust
both
hands
out
in
front
of
him
Luckily
for
Souvenir
he
managed
to
get
away
his
brother-in-law
s
open
hands
came
into
collision
with
the
edge
of
the
billiard-table
and
the
billiard-board
went
flying
off
all
its
six
screws
What
a
mass
of
batter
Souvenir
would
have
been
turned
into
under
those
mighty
hands
I
had
long
been
curious
to
see
how
Martin
Petrovitch
arranged
his
household
what
sort
of
a
home
he
had
One
day
I
invited
myself
to
accompany
him
on
horseback
as
far
as
Eskovo
that
was
the
name
of
his
estate
Upon
my
word
you
want
to
have
a
look
at
my
dominion
was
Martin
Petrovitch
s
comment
By
all
means
I
ll
show
you
the
garden
and
the
house
and
the
threshing-floor
and
everything
I
have
plenty
of
everything
We
set
off
It
was
reckoned
hardly
more
than
a
couple
of
miles
from
our
place
to
Eskovo
Here
it
is
my
dominion
Martin
Petrovitch
roared
suddenly
trying
to
turn
his
immovable
neck
and
waving
his
arm
to
right
and
left
It
s
all
mine
Harlov
s
homestead
lay
on
the
top
of
a
sloping
hill
At
the
bottom
a
few
wretched-looking
peasants
huts
clustered
close
to
a
small
pond
At
the
pond
on
a
washing
platform
an
old
peasant
woman
in
a
check
petticoat
was
beating
some
soaked
linen
with
a
bat
Axinia
boomed
Martin
Petrovitch
but
in
such
a
note
that
the
rooks
flew
up
in
a
flock
from
an
oat-field
near
Washing
your
husband
s
breeches
The
peasant
woman
turned
at
once
and
bowed
very
low
Yes
sir
sounded
her
weak
voice
Ay
ay
Yonder
look
Martin
Petrovitch
continued
proceeding
at
a
trot
alongside
a
half-rotting
wattle
fence
that
is
my
hemp-patch
and
that
yonder
s
the
peasants
see
the
difference
And
this
here
is
my
garden
the
apple-trees
I
planted
and
the
willows
I
planted
too
Else
there
was
no
timber
of
any
sort
here
Look
at
that
and
learn
a
lesson
We
turned
into
the
courtyard
shut
in
by
a
fence
right
opposite
the
gate
rose
an
old
tumbledown
lodge
with
a
thatch
roof
and
steps
up
to
it
raised
on
posts
On
one
side
stood
another
rather
newer
and
with
a
tiny
attic
but
it
too
was
a
ramshackly
affair
Here
you
may
learn
a
lesson
again
observed
Harlov
see
what
a
little
manor-house
our
fathers
lived
in
but
now
see
what
a
mansion
I
have
built
myself
This
mansion
was
like
a
house
of
cards
Five
or
six
dogs
one
more
ragged
and
hideous
than
another
welcomed
us
with
barking
Sheep-dogs
observed
Martin
Petrovitch
Pure-bred
Crimeans
Sh
damned
brutes
I
ll
come
and
strangle
you
one
after
another
On
the
steps
of
the
new
building
there
came
out
a
young
man
in
a
long
full
nankeen
overall
the
husband
of
Martin
Petrovitch
s
elder
daughter
Skipping
quickly
up
to
the
droshky
he
respectfully
supported
his
father-in-law
under
the
elbow
as
he
got
up
and
even
made
as
though
he
would
hold
the
gigantic
feet
which
the
latter
bending
his
bulky
person
forward
lifted
with
a
sweeping
movement
across
the
seat
then
he
assisted
me
to
dismount
from
my
horse
Anna
cried
Harlov
Natalia
Nikolaevna
s
son
has
come
to
pay
us
a
visit
you
must
find
some
good
cheer
for
him
But
where
s
Evlampia
Anna
was
the
name
of
the
elder
daughter
Evlampia
of
the
younger
She
s
not
at
home
she
s
gone
into
the
fields
to
get
cornflowers
responded
Anna
appearing
at
a
little
window
near
the
door
Is
there
any
junket
queried
Harlov
Yes
And
cream
too
Yes
Well
set
them
on
the
table
and
I
ll
show
the
young
gentleman
my
own
room
meanwhile
This
way
please
this
way
he
added
addressing
me
and
beckoning
with
his
forefinger
In
his
own
house
he
treated
me
less
familiarly
as
a
host
he
felt
obliged
to
be
more
formally
respectful
He
led
me
along
a
corridor
Here
is
where
I
abide
he
observed
stepping
sideways
over
the
threshold
of
a
wide
doorway
this
is
my
room
Pray
walk
in
His
room
turned
out
to
be
a
big
unplastered
apartment
almost
empty
on
the
walls
on
nails
driven
in
askew
hung
two
riding-whips
a
three-cornered
hat
reddish
with
wear
a
single-barrelled
gun
a
sabre
a
sort
of
curious
horse-collar
inlaid
with
metal
plates
and
the
picture
representing
a
burning
candle
blown
on
by
the
winds
In
one
corner
stood
a
wooden
settle
covered
with
a
particoloured
rug
Hundreds
of
flies
swarmed
thickly
about
the
ceiling
yet
the
room
was
cool
But
there
was
a
very
strong
smell
of
that
peculiar
odour
of
the
forest
which
always
accompanied
Martin
Petrovitch
Well
is
it
a
nice
room
Harlov
questioned
me
Very
nice
Look-ye
there
hangs
my
Dutch
horse-collar
Harlov
went
on
dropping
into
his
familiar
tone
again
A
splendid
horse-collar
got
it
by
barter
off
a
Jew
Just
you
look
at
it
It
s
a
good
horse-collar
It
s
most
practical
And
just
sniff
it
what
leather
I
smelt
the
horse-collar
It
smelt
of
rancid
oil
and
nothing
else
Now
be
seated
there
on
the
stool
make
yourself
at
home
observed
Harlov
while
he
himself
sank
on
to
the
settle
and
seemed
to
fall
into
a
doze
shutting
his
eyes
and
even
beginning
to
snore
I
gazed
at
him
without
speaking
with
ever
fresh
wonder
he
was
a
perfect
mountain
there
was
no
other
word
Suddenly
he
started
Anna
he
shouted
while
his
huge
stomach
rose
and
fell
like
a
wave
on
the
sea
what
are
you
about
Look
sharp
Didn
t
you
hear
me
Everything
s
ready
father
come
in
I
heard
his
daughter
s
voice
I
inwardly
marvelled
at
the
rapidity
with
which
Martin
Petrovitch
s
behests
had
been
carried
out
and
followed
him
into
the
drawing-room
where
on
a
table
covered
with
a
red
cloth
with
white
flowers
on
it
lunch
was
already
prepared
junket
cream
wheaten
bread
even
powdered
sugar
and
ginger
While
I
set
to
work
on
the
junket
Martin
Petrovitch
growled
affectionately
Eat
my
friend
eat
my
dear
boy
don
t
despise
our
country
cheer
and
sitting
down
again
in
a
corner
again
seemed
to
fall
into
a
doze
Before
me
perfectly
motionless
with
downcast
eyes
stood
Anna
Martinovna
while
I
saw
through
the
window
her
husband
walking
my
cob
up
and
down
the
yard
and
rubbing
the
chain
of
the
snaffle
with
his
own
hands
My
mother
did
not
like
Harlov
s
elder
daughter
she
called
her
a
stuck-up
thing
Anna
Martinovna
scarcely
ever
came
to
pay
us
her
respects
and
behaved
with
chilly
decorum
in
my
mother
s
presence
though
it
was
by
her
good
offices
she
had
been
well
educated
at
a
boarding-school
and
had
been
married
and
on
her
wedding-day
had
received
a
thousand
roubles
and
a
yellow
Turkish
shawl
the
latter
it
is
true
a
trifle
the
worse
for
wear
She
was
a
woman
of
medium
height
thin
very
brisk
and
rapid
in
her
movements
with
thick
fair
hair
and
a
handsome
dark
face
on
which
the
pale-blue
narrow
eyes
showed
up
in
a
rather
strange
but
pleasing
way
She
had
a
straight
thin
nose
her
lips
were
thin
too
and
her
chin
was
like
the
loop-end
of
a
hair-pin
No
one
looking
at
her
could
fail
to
think
Well
you
are
a
clever
creature
and
a
spiteful
one
too
And
for
all
that
there
was
something
attractive
about
her
too
Even
the
dark
moles
scattered
like
buck-wheat
over
her
face
suited
her
and
increased
the
feeling
she
inspired
Her
hands
thrust
into
her
kerchief
she
was
slily
watching
me
looking
downwards
I
was
seated
while
she
was
standing
A
wicked
little
smile
strayed
about
her
lips
and
her
cheeks
and
in
the
shadow
of
her
long
eyelashes
Ugh
you
pampered
little
fine
gentleman
this
smile
seemed
to
express
Every
time
she
drew
a
breath
her
nostrils
slightly
distended
this
too
was
rather
strange
But
all
the
same
it
seemed
to
me
that
were
Anna
Martinovna
to
love
me
or
even
to
care
to
kiss
me
with
her
thin
cruel
lips
I
should
simply
bound
up
to
the
ceiling
with
delight
I
knew
she
was
very
severe
and
exacting
that
the
peasant
women
and
girls
went
in
terror
of
her
but
what
of
that
Anna
Martinovna
secretly
excited
my
imagination
though
after
all
I
was
only
fifteen
then
and
at
that
age
Martin
Petrovitch
roused
himself
again
Anna
he
shouted
you
ought
to
strum
something
on
the
pianoforte
young
gentlemen
are
fond
of
that
I
looked
round
there
was
a
pitiful
semblance
of
a
piano
in
the
room
Yes
father
responded
Anna
Martinovna
Only
what
am
I
to
play
the
young
gentleman
He
won
t
find
it
interesting
Why
what
did
they
teach
you
at
your
young
ladies
seminary
I
ve
forgotten
everything
besides
the
notes
are
broken
Anna
Martinovna
s
voice
was
very
pleasant
resonant
and
rather
plaintive
like
the
note
of
some
birds
of
prey
Very
well
said
Martin
Petrovitch
and
he
lapsed
into
dreaminess
again
Well
he
began
once
more
wouldn
t
you
like
then
to
see
the
threshing-floor
and
have
a
look
round
Volodka
will
escort
you
Hi
Volodka
he
shouted
to
his
son-in-law
who
was
still
pacing
up
and
down
the
yard
with
my
horse
take
the
young
gentleman
to
the
threshing-floor
and
show
him
my
farming
generally
But
I
must
have
a
nap
So
good-bye
He
went
out
and
I
after
him
Anna
Martinovna
at
once
set
to
work
rapidly
and
as
it
were
angrily
clearing
the
table
In
the
doorway
I
turned
and
bowed
to
her
But
she
seemed
not
to
notice
my
bow
and
only
smiled
again
more
maliciously
than
before
I
took
my
horse
from
Harlov
s
son-in-law
and
led
him
by
the
bridle
We
went
together
to
the
threshing-floor
but
as
we
discovered
nothing
very
remarkable
about
it
and
as
he
could
not
suppose
any
great
interest
in
farming
in
a
young
lad
like
me
we
returned
through
the
garden
to
the
main
road
I
was
well
acquainted
with
Harlov
s
son-in-law
His
name
was
Vladimir
Vassilievitch
Sletkin
He
was
an
orphan
brought
up
by
my
mother
and
the
son
of
a
petty
official
to
whom
she
had
intrusted
some
business
He
had
first
been
placed
in
the
district
school
then
he
had
entered
the
seignorial
counting-house
then
he
had
been
put
into
the
service
of
the
government
stores
and
finally
married
to
the
daughter
of
Martin
Petrovitch
My
mother
used
to
call
him
a
little
Jew
and
certainly
with
his
curly
hair
his
black
eyes
always
moist
like
damson
jam
his
hook
nose
and
wide
red
mouth
he
did
suggest
the
Jewish
type
But
the
colour
of
his
skin
was
white
and
he
was
altogether
very
good-looking
He
was
of
a
most
obliging
temper
so
long
as
his
personal
advantage
was
not
involved
Then
he
promptly
lost
all
self-control
from
greediness
and
was
moved
even
to
tears
He
was
ready
to
whine
the
whole
day
long
to
gain
the
paltriest
trifle
he
would
remind
one
a
hundred
times
over
of
a
promise
and
be
hurt
and
complain
if
it
were
not
carried
out
at
once
He
liked
sauntering
about
the
fields
with
a
gun
and
when
he
happened
to
get
a
hare
or
a
wild
duck
he
would
thrust
his
booty
into
his
game-bag
with
peculiar
zest
saying
Now
you
may
be
as
tricky
as
you
like
you
won
t
escape
me
Now
you
re
mine
You
ve
a
good
horse
he
began
in
his
lisping
voice
as
he
assisted
me
to
get
into
the
saddle
I
ought
to
have
a
horse
like
that
But
where
can
I
get
one
I
ve
no
such
luck
If
you
d
ask
your
mamma
now
remind
her
Why
has
she
promised
you
one
Promised
No
but
I
thought
that
in
her
great
kindness
You
should
apply
to
Martin
Petrovitch
To
Martin
Petrovitch
Sletkin
repeated
dwelling
on
each
syllable
To
him
I
m
no
better
than
a
worthless
page
like
Maximka
He
keeps
a
tight
hand
on
us
that
he
does
and
you
get
nothing
from
him
for
all
your
toil
Really
Yes
by
God
He
ll
say
My
word
s
sacred
and
there
it
s
as
though
he
s
chopped
it
off
with
an
axe
You
may
beg
or
not
it
s
all
one
Besides
Anna
Martinovna
my
wife
is
not
in
such
favour
with
him
as
Evlampia
Martinovna
O
merciful
God
bless
us
and
save
us
he
suddenly
interrupted
himself
flinging
up
his
hands
in
despair
Look
what
s
that
A
whole
half-rood
of
oats
our
oats
some
wretch
has
gone
and
cut
The
villain
Just
see
Thieves
thieves
It
s
a
true
saying
to
be
sure
don
t
trust
Eskovo
Beskovo
Erino
and
Byelino
these
were
the
names
of
four
villages
near
Ah
ah
what
a
thing
A
rouble
and
a
half
s
worth
or
maybe
two
roubles
loss
In
Sletkin
s
voice
one
could
almost
hear
sobs
I
gave
my
horse
a
poke
in
the
ribs
and
rode
away
from
him
Sletkin
s
ejaculations
still
reached
my
hearing
when
suddenly
at
a
turn
in
the
road
I
came
upon
the
second
daughter
of
Harlov
Evlampia
who
had
in
the
words
of
Anna
Martinovna
gone
into
the
fields
to
get
cornflowers
A
thick
wreath
of
those
flowers
was
twined
about
her
head
We
exchanged
bows
in
silence
Evlampia
too
was
very
good-looking
as
much
so
as
her
sister
though
in
a
different
style
She
was
tall
and
stoutly
built
everything
about
her
was
on
a
large
scale
her
head
and
her
feet
and
hands
and
her
snow-white
teeth
and
especially
her
eyes
prominent
languishing
eyes
of
the
dark
blue
of
glass
beads
Everything
about
her
while
still
beautiful
had
positively
a
monumental
character
she
was
a
true
daughter
of
Martin
Petrovitch
She
did
not
it
seemed
know
what
to
do
with
her
massive
fair
mane
and
she
had
twisted
it
in
three
plaits
round
her
head
Her
mouth
was
charming
crimson
and
fresh
as
a
rose
and
as
she
talked
her
upper
lip
was
lifted
in
the
middle
in
a
very
fascinating
way
But
there
was
something
wild
and
almost
fierce
in
the
glance
of
her
huge
eyes
A
free
bird
wild
Cossack
breed
so
Martin
Petrovitch
used
to
speak
of
her
I
was
in
awe
of
her
This
stately
beauty
reminded
one
of
her
father
I
rode
on
a
little
farther
and
heard
her
singing
in
a
strong
even
rather
harsh
voice
a
regular
peasant
voice
suddenly
she
ceased
I
looked
round
and
from
the
crest
of
the
hill
saw
her
standing
beside
Harlov
s
son-in-law
facing
the
rood
of
oats
The
latter
was
gesticulating
and
pointing
but
she
stood
without
stirring
The
sun
lighted
up
her
tall
figure
and
the
wreath
of
cornflowers
shone
brilliantly
blue
on
her
head
I
believe
I
have
already
mentioned
that
for
this
second
daughter
of
Harlov
s
too
my
mother
had
already
prepared
a
match
This
was
one
of
the
poorest
of
our
neighbours
a
retired
army
major
Gavrila
Fedulitch
Zhitkov
a
man
no
longer
young
and
as
he
himself
expressed
it
not
without
a
certain
complacency
however
as
though
recommending
himself
battered
and
broken
down
He
could
barely
read
and
write
and
was
exceedingly
stupid
but
secretly
aspired
to
become
my
mother
s
steward
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
a
man
of
action
I
can
warm
the
peasant
s
hides
for
them
if
I
can
do
anything
he
used
to
say
almost
gnashing
his
own
teeth
because
I
was
used
to
it
he
used
to
explain
in
my
former
duties
I
mean
Had
Zhitkov
been
less
of
a
fool
he
would
have
realised
that
he
had
not
the
slightest
chance
of
being
steward
to
my
mother
seeing
that
for
that
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
get
rid
of
the
present
steward
one
Kvitsinsky
a
very
capable
Pole
of
great
character
in
whom
my
mother
had
the
fullest
confidence
Zhitkov
had
a
long
face
like
a
horse
s
it
was
all
overgrown
with
hair
of
a
dusty
whitish
colour
his
cheeks
were
covered
with
it
right
up
to
the
eyes
and
even
in
the
severest
frosts
it
was
sprinkled
with
an
abundant
sweat
like
drops
of
dew
At
the
sight
of
my
mother
he
drew
himself
upright
as
a
post
his
head
positively
quivered
with
zeal
his
huge
hands
slapped
a
little
against
his
thighs
and
his
whole
person
seemed
to
express
Command
and
I
will
strive
my
utmost
My
mother
was
under
no
illusion
on
the
score
of
his
abilities
which
did
not
however
hinder
her
from
taking
steps
to
marry
him
to
Evlampia
Only
will
you
be
able
to
manage
her
my
good
sir
she
asked
him
one
day
Zhitkov
smiled
complacently
Upon
my
word
Natalia
Nikolaevna
I
used
to
keep
a
whole
regiment
in
order
they
were
tame
enough
in
my
hands
and
what
s
this
A
trumpery
business
A
regiment
s
one
thing
sir
but
a
well-bred
girl
a
wife
is
a
very
different
matter
my
mother
observed
with
displeasure
Upon
my
word
ma
am
Natalia
Nikolaevna
Zhitkov
cried
again
that
we
re
quite
able
to
understand
In
one
word
a
young
lady
a
delicate
person
Well
my
mother
decided
at
length
Evlampia
won
t
let
herself
be
trampled
upon
One
day
it
was
the
month
of
June
and
evening
was
coming
on
a
servant
announced
the
arrival
of
Martin
Petrovitch
My
mother
was
surprised
we
had
not
seen
him
for
over
a
week
but
he
had
never
visited
us
so
late
before
Something
has
happened
she
exclaimed
in
an
undertone
The
face
of
Martin
Petrovitch
when
he
rolled
into
the
room
and
at
once
sank
into
a
chair
near
the
door
wore
such
an
unusual
expression
it
was
so
preoccupied
and
positively
pale
that
my
mother
involuntarily
repeated
her
exclamation
aloud
Martin
Petrovitch
fixed
his
little
eyes
upon
her
was
silent
for
a
space
sighed
heavily
was
silent
again
and
articulated
at
last
that
he
had
come
about
something
which
was
of
a
kind
that
on
account
of
Muttering
these
disconnected
words
he
suddenly
got
up
and
went
out
My
mother
rang
ordered
the
footman
who
appeared
to
overtake
Martin
Petrovitch
at
once
and
bring
him
back
without
fail
but
the
latter
had
already
had
time
to
get
into
his
droshky
and
drive
away
Next
morning
my
mother
who
was
astonished
and
even
alarmed
as
much
by
Martin
Petrovitch
s
strange
behaviour
as
by
the
extraordinary
expression
of
his
face
was
on
the
point
of
sending
a
special
messenger
to
him
when
he
made
his
appearance
This
time
he
seemed
more
composed
Tell
me
my
good
friend
tell
me
cried
my
mother
directly
she
saw
him
what
ever
has
happened
to
you
I
thought
yesterday
upon
my
word
I
did
Mercy
on
us
I
thought
Hasn
t
our
old
friend
gone
right
off
his
head
I
ve
not
gone
off
my
head
madam
answered
Martin
Petrovitch
I
m
not
that
sort
of
man
But
I
want
to
consult
with
you
What
about
I
m
only
in
doubt
whether
it
will
be
agreeable
to
you
in
this
same
contingency
Speak
away
speak
away
my
good
sir
but
more
simply
Don
t
alarm
me
What
s
this
same
contingency
Speak
more
plainly
Or
is
it
your
melancholy
come
upon
you
again
Harlov
scowled
No
it
s
not
melancholy
that
comes
upon
me
in
the
new
moon
but
allow
me
to
ask
you
madam
what
do
you
think
about
death
My
mother
was
taken
aback
About
what
About
death
Can
death
spare
any
one
whatever
in
this
world
What
have
you
got
in
your
head
my
good
friend
Who
of
us
is
immortal
For
all
you
re
born
a
giant
even
to
you
there
ll
be
an
end
in
time
There
will
oh
there
will
Harlov
assented
and
he
looked
downcast
I
ve
had
a
vision
come
to
me
in
my
dreams
he
brought
out
at
last
What
are
you
saying
my
mother
interrupted
him
A
vision
in
my
dreams
he
repeated
I
m
a
seer
of
visions
you
know
You
I
Didn
t
you
know
it
Harlov
sighed
Well
so
Over
a
week
ago
madam
I
lay
down
on
the
very
last
day
of
eating
meat
before
St
Peter
s
fast-day
I
lay
down
after
dinner
to
rest
a
bit
well
and
so
I
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
a
raven
colt
ran
into
the
room
to
me
And
this
colt
began
sporting
about
and
grinning
Black
as
a
beetle
was
the
raven
colt
Harlov
ceased
Well
said
my
mother
And
all
of
a
sudden
this
same
colt
turns
round
and
gives
me
a
kick
in
the
left
elbow
right
in
the
funny
bone
I
waked
up
my
arm
would
not
move
nor
my
leg
either
Well
thinks
I
it
s
paralysis
however
I
worked
them
up
and
down
and
got
them
to
move
again
only
there
were
shooting
pains
in
the
joints
a
long
time
and
there
are
still
When
I
open
my
hand
the
pains
shoot
through
the
joints
Why
Martin
Petrovitch
you
must
have
lain
upon
your
arm
somehow
and
crushed
it
No
madam
pray
don
t
talk
like
that
It
was
an
intimation
referring
to
my
death
I
mean
Well
upon
my
word
my
mother
was
beginning
An
intimation
Prepare
thyself
man
as
twere
to
say
And
therefore
madam
here
is
what
I
have
to
announce
to
you
without
a
moment
s
delay
Not
wishing
Harlov
suddenly
began
shouting
that
the
same
death
should
come
upon
me
the
servant
of
God
unawares
I
have
planned
in
my
own
mind
this
to
divide
now
during
my
lifetime
my
estate
between
my
two
daughters
Anna
and
Evlampia
according
as
God
Almighty
directs
me
Martin
Petrovitch
stopped
groaned
and
added
without
a
moment
s
delay
Well
that
would
be
a
good
idea
observed
my
mother
though
I
think
you
have
no
need
to
be
in
a
hurry
And
seeing
that
herein
I
desire
Harlov
continued
raising
his
voice
still
higher
to
be
observant
of
all
due
order
and
legality
so
I
humbly
beg
your
young
son
Dmitri
Semyonovitch
I
would
not
venture
madam
to
trouble
you
I
beg
the
said
Dmitri
Semyonovitch
your
son
and
I
claim
of
my
kinsman
Bitchkov
as
a
plain
duty
to
assist
at
the
ratification
of
the
formal
act
and
transference
of
possession
to
my
two
daughters
Anna
married
and
Evlampia
spinster
Which
act
will
be
drawn
up
in
readiness
the
day
after
to-morrow
at
twelve
o
clock
at
my
own
place
Eskovo
also
called
Kozulkino
in
the
presence
of
the
ruling
authorities
and
functionaries
who
are
thereto
invited
Martin
Petrovitch
with
difficulty
reached
the
end
of
this
speech
which
he
had
obviously
learnt
by
heart
and
which
was
interspersed
with
frequent
sighs
He
seemed
to
have
no
breath
left
in
his
chest
his
pale
face
was
crimson
again
and
he
several
times
wiped
the
sweat
off
it
So
you
ve
already
composed
the
deed
dividing
your
property
my
mother
queried
When
did
you
manage
that
I
managed
it
oh
Neither
eating
nor
drinking
Did
you
write
it
yourself
Volodka
oh
helped
And
have
you
forwarded
a
petition
I
have
and
the
chamber
has
sanctioned
it
and
notice
has
been
given
to
the
district
court
and
the
temporary
division
of
the
local
court
has
oh
been
notified
to
be
present
My
mother
laughed
I
see
Martin
Petrovitch
you
ve
made
every
arrangement
already
and
how
quickly
You
ve
not
spared
money
I
should
say
No
indeed
madam
Well
well
And
you
say
you
want
to
consult
with
me
Well
my
little
Dmitri
can
go
and
I
ll
send
Souvenir
with
him
and
speak
to
Kvitsinsky
But
you
haven
t
invited
Gavrila
Fedulitch
Gavrila
Fedulitch
Mr
Zhitkov
has
had
notice
from
me
also
As
a
betrothed
it
was
only
fitting
Martin
Petrovitch
had
obviously
exhausted
all
the
resources
of
his
eloquence
Besides
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
he
did
not
look
altogether
favourably
on
the
match
my
mother
had
made
for
his
daughter
possibly
he
had
expected
a
more
advantageous
marriage
for
his
darling
Evlampia
He
got
up
from
his
chair
and
made
a
scrape
with
his
foot
Thank
you
for
your
consent
Where
are
you
off
to
asked
my
mother
Stay
a
bit
I
ll
order
some
lunch
to
be
served
you
Much
obliged
responded
Harlov
But
I
can
not
Oh
I
must
get
home
He
backed
and
was
about
to
move
sideways
as
his
habit
was
through
the
door
Stop
stop
a
minute
my
mother
went
on
can
you
possibly
mean
to
make
over
the
whole
of
your
property
without
reserve
to
your
daughters
Certainly
without
reserve
Well
but
how
about
yourself
where
are
you
going
to
live
Harlov
positively
flung
up
his
hands
in
amazement
You
ask
where
In
my
house
at
home
as
I
ve
lived
hitherto
so
henceforward
Whatever
difference
could
there
be
You
have
such
confidence
in
your
daughters
and
your
son-in-law
then
Were
you
pleased
to
speak
of
Volodka
A
poor
stick
like
him
Why
I
can
do
as
I
like
with
him
whatever
it
is
what
authority
has
he
As
for
them
my
daughters
that
is
to
care
for
me
till
I
m
in
the
grave
to
give
me
meat
and
drink
and
clothe
me
Merciful
heavens
it
s
their
first
duty
I
shall
not
long
be
an
eyesore
to
them
Death
s
not
over
the
hills
it
s
upon
my
shoulders
Death
is
in
God
s
hands
observed
my
mother
though
that
is
their
duty
to
be
sure
Only
pardon
me
Martin
Petrovitch
your
elder
girl
Anna
is
well
known
to
be
proud
and
imperious
and
well
the
second
has
a
fierce
look
Natalia
Nikolaevna
Harlov
broke
in
why
do
you
say
that
Why
as
though
they
My
daughters
Why
as
though
I
Forget
their
duty
Never
in
their
wildest
dreams
Offer
opposition
To
whom
Their
parent
Dare
to
do
such
a
thing
Have
they
not
my
curse
to
fear
They
ve
passed
their
life
long
in
fear
and
in
submission
and
all
of
a
sudden
Good
Lord
Harlov
choked
there
was
a
rattle
in
his
