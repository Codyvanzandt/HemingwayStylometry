Vladimir
Sergeitch
And
that
is
quite
right
on
your
part
an
swered
Ipatov
but
draughts
is
hardly
a
game
but
rather
an
amusement
a
pastime
is
n't
it
Ivan
Ilyitch
Ivan
Ilyitch
looked
at
Ipatov
with
an
apa
thetic
expression
which
seemed
to
say
The
devil
knows
which
it
is
a
game
or
an
amuse
ment
but
after
a
brief
pause
he
brought
out
Yes
draughts
is
all
right
Chess
now
they
say
is
a
different
matter
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Ipatov
went
on
they
say
it
is
a
very
difficult
game
But
to
my
mind
ah
but
here
are
my
young
people
he
interrupted
himself
look
ing
through
the
half-open
glass
door
that
led
into
the
park
Vladimir
Sergeitch
got
up
turned
round
and
saw
first
two
little
girls
about
ten
years
old
in
pink
cotton
dresses
and
big
hats
running
nimbly
up
the
verandah
steps
not
far
behind
them
appeared
a
tall
plump
graceful
girl
of
twenty
wearing
a
dark
dress
They
all
came
into
the
room
the
little
girls
made
formal
curt
seys
to
the
visitor
Let
me
introduce
my
little
daughters
said
the
old
gentleman
This
is
Katya
and
this
is
Nastya
and
this
is
my
sister-in-law
Marya
Pavlovna
whom
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
mentioning
to
you
already
I
hope
you
will
be
good
friends
Vladimir
Sergeitch
bowed
to
Marya
Pav
lovna
she
responded
with
a
hardly
perceptible
inclination
of
her
head
Marya
Pavlovna
had
a
large
open
knife
in
her
hand
her
thick
brown
hair
was
a
little
untidy
a
small
green
leaf
had
caught
in
it
a
tress
had
come
loose
from
the
comb
there
was
a
flush
on
her
dark
skin
her
red
lips
were
parted
her
dress
looked
crumpled
She
was
out
of
breath
her
eyes
were
shining
evidently
she
had
been
working
in
the
garden
She
went
out
of
the
room
at
once
and
the
little
girls
ran
after
her
To
smarten
themselves
up
a
little
ob
served
the
old
gentleman
addressing
Vladimir
Sergeitch
they
must
think
of
that
of
course
Vladimir
Sergeitch
smirked
in
response
and
grew
a
little
thoughtful
Marya
Pavlovna
had
made
an
impression
upon
him
It
was
many
years
since
he
had
seen
such
a
typical
beauty
of
the
Russian
steppes
She
soon
came
back
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
and
sat
without
mov
ing
She
had
done
her
hair
but
she
had
not
changed
her
dress
and
had
not
even
put
on
cuffs
There
was
an
expression
on
her
face
not
so
much
of
pride
as
of
severity
almost
of
roughness
her
brow
was
broad
and
low
her
nose
was
short
and
straight
from
time
to
time
her
lips
curved
in
a
slow
languid
smile
there
was
a
scornful
frown
on
her
straight
brows
Nearly
all
the
time
she
kept
her
big
dark
eyes
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
cast
down
I
know
her
ungracious
young
face
seemed
to
be
saying
I
know
that
you
are
all
looking
at
me
well
look
you
weary
me
When
she
did
raise
her
eyes
there
was
some
thing
wild
beautiful
and
unseeing
in
them
that
recalled
the
eyes
of
a
doe
She
was
beauti
fully
proportioned
A
classical
poet
would
have
compared
her
to
Ceres
or
Juno
What
were
you
doing
in
the
garden
Ipatov
asked
trying
to
draw
her
into
the
con
versation
I
was
cutting
off
the
dead
branches
and
ligging
the
flower-beds
she
said
in
a
rather
low
agreeable
and
resonant
voice
Well
and
are
you
tired
The
children
are
tired
I
am
not
I
know
said
the
old
man
with
a
smile
you
are
a
regular
Bobelina
And
have
you
been
in
to
Grandmamma
Yes
she
is
asleep
Are
you
fond
of
flowers
Vladimir
Serge
itch
asked
her
Yes
Why
do
n't
you
put
your
hat
on
when
you
go
out
Ipatov
observed
to
her
see
how
red
and
sunburnt
you
are
She
passed
her
hand
over
her
face
and
said
nothing
Her
hands
were
not
large
but
rather
broad
and
red
She
did
not
wear
gloves
And
are
you
fond
of
gardening
Vladimir
Sergeitch
asked
again
Yes
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
to
describe
a
beau
tiful
garden
belonging
to
a
wealthy
landowner
in
his
neighbourhood
The
German
head
gar
dener
alone
receives
a
salary
of
two
thousand
silver
roubles
he
observed
among
other
things
And
what
is
the
name
of
the
gardener
Ivan
Ilyitch
asked
suddenly
I
do
n't
remember
Meyer
or
Miller
I
be
lieve
Why
do
you
ask
Oh
said
Ivan
Ilyitch
simply
to
know
his
surname
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
on
with
his
descrip
tion
The
little
girls
Mihail
Nikolaitch's
daughters
came
in
quietly
sat
down
and
be
gan
quietly
listening
A
servant
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
an
nounced
that
Yegor
Kapitonitch
had
arrived
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Ah
Ask
him
in
ask
him
in
cried
Ipatov
A
short
stout
old
gentleman
came
in
one
of
those
people
who
are
described
as
stubby
or
stumpy
with
a
puffy
and
at
the
same
time
wrinkled
face
that
recalled
a
baked
apple
He
had
on
a
grey
Hungarian
jacket
with
black
frogs
and
a
stand-up
collar
his
full
coffee-col
oured
plush
breeches
ended
far
above
his
ankles
How
are
you
honoured
Yegor
Kapiton
itch
exclaimed
Ipatov
going
to
meet
him
It
is
a
long
time
since
we
have
seen
you
But
Mihail
Nikolaitch
began
Yegor
Kapi
tonitch
in
a
lisping
and
plaintive
voice
first
bowing
to
all
present
you
know
I
am
not
a
free
man
am
I
In
what
way
are
you
not
a
free
man
Yegor
Kapitonitch
Why
Mihail
Nikolaitch
my
family
things
to
see
to
And
then
there
is
Matryona
Markovna
And
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair
What
about
Matryona
Markovna
And
Ipatov
winked
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
as
though
wishing
to
secure
his
attention
Why
to
be
sure
said
Yegor
Kapltonitch
sitting
down
she
is
dissatisfied
with
me
as
though
you
did
n't
know
Whatever
I
say
it
is
ahvays
wrong
unrefined
improper
And
why
it
is
improper
God
only
knows
And
the
young
ladies
that
is
my
daughters
do
the
same
following
their
mother
's
example
I
am
not
saying
anything
against
her
of
course
Matryona
Markovna
is
an
excellent
woman
but
very
strict
about
manners
But
upon
my
word
Yegor
Kapitonitch
what
is
there
wrong
with
your
manners
That
's
just
what
I
think
myself
but
it
seems
she
is
hard
to
please
Yesterday
for
instance
I
said
at
table
'Matryona
Markovna
and
Yegor
Kapitonitch
put
a
most
ingratiating
in
tonation
into
his
voice
'Matr
'ona
Markovna
I
said
'how
careless
Alyoshka
is
with
the
horses
He
does
not
know
how
to
drive
he
has
quite
knocked
up
the
black
stallion
And
dear
me
how
Matryona
Markovna
did
flare
iip
and
began
crying
shame
on
me
'You
don't
know
how
to
express
yourself
decently
in
la
dies
society
she
said
the
young
ladies
jumped
up
and
left
the
table
at
once
and
next
day
the
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Biryulovsky
young
ladies
my
wife
's
nieces
knew
all
about
it
And
what
improper
expres
sion
did
I
use
Judge
for
yourself
And
whatever
I
say
I
may
speak
a
little
incau
tiously
sometimes
everyone
does
especially
at
home
the
Biryulovsky
young
ladies
know
all
about
it
next
day
I
simply
do
n't
know
what
to
do
Sometimes
I
am
sitting
like
this
think
ing
as
my
way
is
as
perhaps
you
are
aware
I
breathe
rather
heavily
and
Matryona
Mark
ovna
scolds
me
again
'Do
n't
snuffle
she
says
'nobody
snuffles
nowadays
'Why
are
you
scolding
Matryona
Markovna
I
say
'you
ought
to
be
sorry
for
me
and
you
are
scolding
Well
I
have
had
to
give
up
thinking
at
home
I
sit
and
simply
look
at
the
floor
like
this
yes
indeed
And
the
other
day
we
were
going
to
bed
'Matryona
Markovna
I
said
'it
's
dread
ful
how
you
spoil
your
page
my
dear
he
is
such
a
little
pig
said
I
'he
might
wash
his
face
on
Sunday
anyway
Well
I
hinted
it
deli
cately
enough
I
should
have
thought
but
I
did
not
please
her
this
time
either
Matryona
Markovna
began
putting
me
to
shame
again
'You
do
not
know
how
to
behave
in
the
com
pany
of
a
lady
said
she
and
next
day
the
Biryulovsky
young
ladies
knew
all
about
it
So
how
can
I
have
the
heart
to
go
out
paying
visits
Mihail
Nikolaitch
I
am
astonished
at
what
you
tell
me
re
plied
Ipatov
I
should
never
have
expected
this
of
Matryona
Markovna
I
should
have
thought
she
was
The
best
of
women
Yegor
Kapitonitch
caught
him
up
an
exemplary
wife
and
mother
one
may
say
but
strict
on
the
point
of
man
ners
She
says
that
in
everything
what
is
needed
is
ensemble
and
that
I
have
not
got
that
I
do
n't
speak
French
as
you
know
I
only
un
derstand
it
But
what
is
this
ensemble
which
I
am
lacking
in
Ipatov
who
was
not
very
great
at
French
himself
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
And
how
are
your
children
your
sons
that
is
he
asked
Yegor
Kapitonitch
after
a
brief
pause
Yegor
Kapitonitch
looked
at
him
sideways
My
sons
They
are
all
right
I
am
pleased
with
them
The
young
ladies
have
got
out
of
hand
but
I
am
satisfied
with
my
sons
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Alyoshka
is
doing
well
in
the
service
his
su
periors
praise
him
my
Alyoshka
is
a
shrewd
lad
Mihets
is
different
he
has
turned
out
a
sort
of
a
philanthropist
Why
a
philanthropist
'Goodness
knows
never
speaks
to
anyone
fights
shy
of
us
all
Matryona
Markovna
only
makes
him
worse
'Why
do
you
follow
your
father
's
example
she
says
You
should
respect
him
but
you
should
imitate
your
moth
er
's
manners
When
he
is
grown
up
he
will
get
on
too
Vladimir
Sergeitch
asked
Ipatov
to
intro
duce
him
to
Yegor
Kapitonitch
A
conversa
tion
followed
Marya
Pavlovna
took
no
part
in
it
Ivan
Ilyitch
sat
down
beside
her
but
he
only
said
two
words
to
her
the
little
girls
went
up
to
him
and
began
telling
him
some
thing
in
a
whisper
The
housekeeper
a
thin
old
woman
with
a
dark
kerchief
on
her
head
came
in
and
announced
that
dinner
was
ready
They
all
went
into
the
dining-room
Dinner
lasted
rather
a
long
time
Ipatov
kept
a
good
cook
and
had
good
wine
though
it
did
not
come
from
Moscow
but
from
the
town
of
the
province
Ipatov
lived
in
com
fort
he
had
no
more
than
three
hundred
serfs
but
he
was
in
debt
to
no
one
and
his
estate
was
in
good
order
The
master
of
the
house
himself
did
most
of
the
talking
at
dinner
Yegor
Kapitonitch
seconded
him
but
did
not
forget
to
look
after
himself
he
ate
and
drank
in
fine
style
Marya
Pavlovna
was
silent
only
answering
with
a
half
smile
the
hurried
say
ings
of
the
two
little
girls
sitting
one
on
each
side
of
her
they
seemed
to
be
very
fond
of
her
Vladimir
Sergeitch
attempted
several
times
to
talk
to
her
but
with
no
great
success
The
Adjustable
Soul
Bodryakov
was
sloth
ful
and
apathetic
even
in
his
eating
After
dinner
they
all
went
on
to
the
veran
dah
to
drink
coffee
The
weather
was
lovely
the
sweet
fragrance
of
lime-trees
in
full
flower
was
wafted
from
the
park
the
summer
air
slightly
freshened
by
the
thick
shade
of
the
trees
and
the
dampness
of
the
pond
close
by
was
full
of
caressing
warmth
All
at
once
from
beyond
the
poplars
of
the
dam
came
the
sound
of
scurrying
horses
hoofs
and
a
moment
later
a
lady
wearing
a
long
rid
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
ing
habit
and
a
round
grey
hat
came
into
sight
mounted
on
a
bay
horse
she
was
riding
at
a
gallop
a
page
rode
behind
on
a
small
white
cob
Ah
cried
Ipatov
here
is
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
what
a
pleasant
surprise
Alone
asked
Marya
Pavlovna
who
had
till
that
moment
stood
motionless
by
the
door
Yes
alone
I
suppose
something
has
detained
Pyotr
Alexeitch
Marya
Pavlovna
looked
up
from
under
her
brows
her
face
was
suffused
with
colour
and
she
turned
away
Meanwhile
the
lady
on
horseback
rode
through
the
little
gate
into
the
garden
galloped
up
to
the
terrace
and
leapt
lightly
to
the
ground
without
waiting
for
her
page
or
Ipatov
who
was
coming
to
meet
her
Dexterously
picking
up
the
hem
of
her
long
skirt
she
ran
up
the
steps
and
as
she
landed
on
the
verandah
she
called
gaily
Here
I
am
You
are
very
welcome
said
Ipatov
How
unexpected
How
delightful
Allow
me
to
kiss
your
hand
Certainly
replied
the
visitor
only
pull
off
my
glove
yourself
I
ca
n't
do
it
And
stretching
out
her
hand
to
him
she
nodded
to
Marya
Pavlovna
Masha
only
fancy
my
brother
wo
n't
be
here
to-day
she
said
with
a
faint
sigh
I
see
that
he
is
not
here
Marya
Pavlovna
answered
in
an
undertone
He
told
me
to
tell
you
that
he
is
busy
Do
n't
be
angry
Good
afternoon
Yegor
Kapi
tonitch
good
afternoon
Ivan
Ilyitch
good
af
ternoon
children
Vassya
said
the
vis
itor
addressing
her
page
tell
them
to
walk
Beauty
up
and
down
a
little
do
you
hear
Masha
give
me
a
pin
please
to
fasten
up
my
train
Mihail
Nikolaitch
come
here
Ipatov
went
nearer
to
her
Who
is
that
new
person
she
asked
in
a
fairly
loud
voice
A
neighbour
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Astahov
you
know
the
owner
of
Sasovo
Shall
I
introduce
him
Very
well
presently
Oh
what
lovely
weather
she
went
on
Yegor
Kapitonitch
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
tell
me
does
Matryona
Markovna
scold
even
in
weather
like
this
Matryona
I\Iarkovna
does
not
scold
in
any
weather
Madam
she
is
only
strict
about
man
ners
And
what
are
the
Biryulovsky
young
ladies
doing
They
know
everything
next
day
don't
they
And
she
broke
into
a
ringing
silvery
laugh
You
are
always
pleased
to
laugh
said
Yegor
Kapitonitch
But
when
should
one
laugh
if
not
at
your
age
Yegor
Kapitonitch
do
n't
be
angry
there's
a
dear
Oh
I
am
tired
let
me
sit
down
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
sank
into
a
low
chair
and
roguishly
pulled
her
hat
right
down
to
her
eyes
Ipatov
brought
Vladimir
Sergeitch
up
to
her
Allow
me
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
to
pre
sent
to
you
our
neighbour
Monsieur
Astahov
of
whom
you
have
probably
heard
a
great
deal
Vladimir
Sergeitch
bowed
and
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
looked
up
at
him
from
under
the
brim
of
her
round
hat
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
Veretyev
is
our
neighbour
Ipatov
went
on
addressing
Vladi
mir
Sergeitch
She
lives
here
with
her
brother
Pyotr
Alexeitch
formerly
a
lieutenant
in
the
Guards
She
is
a
great
friend
of
my
sis
ter-in-law
and
is
agreeably
disposed
to
us
all
A
full
and
complete
description
said
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
with
a
mocking
smile
looking
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
from
under
her
hat
again
And
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
thinking
mean
while
She
is
very
pretty
too
And
cer
tainly
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
was
a
very
charm
ing
girl
slim
and
graceful
she
looked
much
younger
than
she
was
She
was
twenty-seven
She
had
a
round
face
and
a
little
head
fluffy
fair
hair
a
sharp
almost
saucily
turned-up
nose
and
gay
rather
sly
eyes
Her
eyes
fairly
gleamed
and
flashed
with
mockery
Her
ex
tremely
lively
and
mobile
features
wore
at
times
an
amusing
expression
they
seemed
to
be
alive
with
humour
From
time
to
time
as
a
rule
quite
suddenly
a
shade
of
pensiveness
would
pass
over
her
face
and
then
it
became
gentle
and
good-natured
but
she
could
not
be
A
OUIET
BACKWATER
thoughtful
for
long
She
readily
detected
the
comic
side
of
people
and
drew
rather
good
caricatures
From
her
birth
upwards
she
had
been
spoiled
by
everyone
and
that
could
be
seen
from
the
first
moment
people
who
have
been
spoiled
in
their
childhood
retain
a
certain
stamp
all
their
lives
Her
brother
was
fond
of
her
though
he
did
declare
that
she
stung
not
like
a
bee
but
like
a
wasp
since
the
bee
dies
when
it
stings
while
stinging
means
noth
ing
to
the
wasp
This
comparison
vexed
her
Are
you
staying
here
long
she
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
dropping
her
eyes
and
twisting
her
riding
whip
in
her
hands
No
I
propose
going
away
to-morrow
Where
are
you
going
Home
Home
Why
may
I
venture
to
ask
Why
I
have
business
at
home
that
ad
mits
of
no
delay
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
looked
at
him
Are
you
such
a
business-like
person
I
try
to
be
business-like
replied
Vladimir
Sergeitch
In
our
practical
age
every
decent
person
ought
to
be
practical
and
business-like
THE
two
FRIENBS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
That
is
perfectly
true
observed
Ipatov
Is
n't
it
Ivan
llyitch
Ivan
llyitch
simply
glanced
at
Ipatov
while
Yegor
Kapitonitch
commented
Yes
that
is
so
It
is
a
pity
said
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
a
jeune
premier
is
just
what
we
are
short
of
You
can
act
comedy
ca
n't
you
I
have
never
tried
my
powers
in
that
line
I
am
sure
you
would
act
well
You
have
such
a
dignified
deportment
that
's
essen
tial
for
a
jeune
premier
of
to-day
My
brother
and
I
are
thinking
of
setting
up
a
dramatic
society
here
But
we
shall
not
con
fine
ourselves
to
comedies
we
shall
act
every
thing
dramas
ballets
and
even
tragedies
Would
n't
Masha
make
a
fine
Cleopatra
or
Phaedra
Look
at
her
Vladimir
Sergeitch
turned
round
Lean
ing
with
her
head
against
the
door
Marya
Pav
lovna
was
standing
with
her
arms
folded
gaz
ing
dreamily
into
the
distance
Certainly
at
that
moment
her
harmonious
features
were
suggestive
of
antique
sculpture
She
had
not
A
QUIET
jSACKWATER
heard
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
's
last
words
but
noticing
that
all
eyes
were
suddenly
turned
upon
her
she
immediately
guessed
what
was
being
said
flushed
crimson
and
was
on
the
point
of
retreating
into
the
drawing-room
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
quickly
seized
her
by
the
hand
and
with
the
coquettish
tenderness
of
a
kitten
drew
the
almost
masculine-looking
hand
to
her
and
kissed
it
Marya
Pavlcvna
flushed
a
deeper
colour
You
are
always
full
of
mischief
Nadya
she
said
Did
n't
I
tell
the
truth
about
you
I
ap
peal
to
you
all
Well
there
there
I'll
stop
But
I
tell
you
again
Nadyezhda
Alex
yevna
went
on
addressing
Vladimir
Sergeitch
it
is
a
pity
you
are
going
away
It
is
true
we
have
got
a
jeune
pre\mier
he
forces
him
self
upon
us
indeed
but
he
is
a
very
poor
one
Who
is
that
may
I
ask
Bodryakov
the
poet
How
can
a
poet
be
a
jcune
premier
In
the
first
place
he
dresses
horribly
in
the
second
though
he
writes
epi
grams
in
the
presence
of
any
woman
even
of
me
imagine
he
is
overcome
with
shyness
He
lisps
always
holds
one
arm
above
his
head
and
I
do
n't
know
what
he
does
n't
do
Tell
me
please
Monsieur
Astahov
are
all
poets
like
that
Vladimir
Sergeitch
drew
himself
up
a
little
I
have
never
known
one
personally
and
I
must
confess
I
have
never
sought
their
ac
quaintance
Yes
of
course
you
are
a
practical
man
We
shall
have
to
take
Bodryakov
there
is
no
help
for
it
The
other
jeunes
premiers
are
even
worse
He
would
learn
his
part
any
way
In
addition
to
the
tragic
parts
Masha
will
be
our
prima-donna
Have
you
heard
her
sing
Monsieur
Astahov
No
replied
Vladimir
Sergeitch
with
a
smirk
I
did
n't
know
What
is
the
matter
with
you
to-day
Nadya
said
Marya
Pavlovna
with
an
air
of
vexation
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
jumped
up
Do
sing
us
something
Masha
please
do
I
'll
give
you
no
peace
till
you
do
Masha
darling
I
'd
sing
myself
to
entertain
your
vis
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
tor
but
you
know
what
a
horrid
voice
I
have
But
see
how
nicely
I
'll
accompany
you
Marya
Pavlovna
did
not
speak
for
a
minute
There
's
no
putting
you
off
she
said
at
last
You
are
used
to
having
your
own
way
in
everything
like
a
spoiled
child
Very
well
I
will
sing
Bravo
bravo
cried
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
and
she
clapped
her
hands
Gentlemen
let
us
go
into
the
drawing-room
As
for
having
my
own
way
I
'll
score
that
against
you
she
added
laughing
How
can
you
expose
my
weaknesses
before
strangers
Yegor
Kapiton
itch
is
that
how
Matryona
Markovna
puts
you
to
shame
before
strangers
Matryona
Markovna
muttered
Yegor
Kapitonitch
is
a
very
estimable
lady
only
on
the
point
of
manners
Well
come
along
come
along
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
interrupted
him
and
she
went
into
the
drawing-room
Everyone
followed
her
She
flung
down
her
hat
and
sat
down
at
the
piano
Marya
Pavlovna
stood
by
the
wall
at
some
distance
from
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
Masha
she
said
after
a
moment
's
thought
sing
us
'The
Peasant
Lad
the
Wheat
Is
Sow
ing
Iarya
Pavlovna
began
singing
Her
voice
was
pure
and
strong
and
she
sang
well
sim
ply
and
naturally
Everyone
listened
to
her
with
great
attention
and
Vladimir
Sergeitch
could
not
conceal
his
astonishment
When
Marya
Pavlovna
had
finished
he
went
up
to
her
and
began
declaring
that
he
had
had
no
idea
Wait
a
bit
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
inter
rupted
him
there
's
better
to
come
Masha
I
will
comfort
your
Little
Russian
heart
sing
us
now
'Merry
Uproar
in
the
Oakwood
Are
you
a
Little
Russian
Vladimir
Serge
itch
asked
her
I
was
born
in
Little
Russia
she
answered
and
she
began
singing
the
Merry
Uproar
At
first
she
articulated
the
words
indiffer
ently
but
the
mournfully
passionate
tune
of
her
native
land
by
degrees
roused
her
her
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
cheeks
flushed
her
eyes
shone
there
was
a
warm
ring
in
her
voice
She
finished
Good
heavens
how
well
you
sang
that
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
commented
bending
over
the
keys
What
a
pity
my
brother
is
not
here
Marya
Pavlovna
dropped
her
eyes
at
once
and
her
characteristic
bitter
smile
came
on
to
her
lips
And
now
we
must
have
something
more
observed
Ipatov
Yes
if
you
would
be
so
good
added
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Excuse
me
I
wo
n't
sing
any
more
to-night
said
Marya
Pavlovna
and
she
walked
away
from
the
piano
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
looked
after
her
seemed
thoughtful
for
a
minute
then
smiled
began
playing
with
one
finger
The
Peasant
Lad
the
Wheat
Is
Sowing
then
suddenly
broke
into
a
brilliant
polka
and
without
finishing
it
struck
a
loud
chord
shut
the
piano
and
got
up
It
is
a
pity
there
's
no
one
to
dance
with
she
exclaimed
That
would
have
been
just
the
thing
TME
TWO
FRIfiNBS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
up
to
her
What
a
wonderful
voice
Marya
Pavlovna
has
he
said
and
with
what
feeling
she
sings
Are
you
fond
of
music
Yes
very
Such
a
learned
person
and
fond
of
music
i
Why
do
you
suppose
that
I
am
learned
Oh
yes
I
beg
your
pardon
I
was
forget
ting
you
are
a
practical
man
Where
is
Masha
gone
Wait
I
'll
go
and
fetch
her
And
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
fluttered
out
of
the
room
Giddy
head
as
you
see
said
Ipatov
going
up
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
but
a
very
good
heart
And
what
an
education
she
has
had
you
can
not
fancy
she
can
speak
in
every
lan
guage
Of
course
they
are
people
of
property
so
no
wonder
Yes
Vladimir
Sergeitch
acquiesced
ab
sent-mindedly
very
charming
young
lady
But
tell
me
was
your
wife
also
from
Little
Russia
Yes
My
wife
was
a
Little
Russian
like
her
sister
Marya
Pavlovna
To
tell
the
truth
my
wife
's
accent
was
not
perfect
though
she
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
knew
the
Russian
language
perfectly
she
did
not
pronounce
it
correctly
her
vowel
sounds
were
not
quite
pure
Marya
Pavlovna
now
left
her
own
country
when
she
was
little
Yet
one
can
see
the
Little
Russian
blood
can't
oner
Marya
Pavlovna
sings
wonderfully
ob
served
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Yes
she
does
sing
well
But
why
is
it
they
do
n't
bring
in
the
tea
And
what
has
be
come
of
the
young
ladies
It
is
tea-time
The
young
ladies
did
not
return
for
some
time
Meanwhile
the
samovar
was
brought
in
and
the
table
was
set
for
tea
Ipatov
sent
for
them
They
came
back
together
Marya
Pav
lovna
sat
down
at
the
table
to
pour
out
tea
while
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
went
to
the
door
of
the
verandah
and
looked
out
into
the
gar
den
The
bright
summer
day
was
followed
by
a
soft
clear
evening
there
was
the
glow
of
sunset
the
broad
pond
half
flooded
with
its
crimson
light
stood
a
motionless
mirror
with
stately
serenity
reflecting
in
the
silvery
darkness
of
its
deep
bosom
all
ihe
fathomless
ethereal
sky
and
the
black
shapes
of
the
trees
upside
down
and
the
house
Everything
had
sunk
into
silence
there
was
not
a
sound
anywhere
Look
how
beautiful
said
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
as
he
came
up
to
her
Out
there
in
the
pond
a
star
has
just
come
out
beside
the
lights
of
the
house
they
are
red
but
it
is
golden
Here
is
Grand
mamma
coming
she
added
A
bath-chair
came
into
view
from
behind
the
lilac
bushes
Two
men
were
drawing
it
The
bent
figure
of
an
old
lady
with
her
head
bowed
on
her
breast
was
sitting
muffled
up
in
it
The
fringe
of
her
white
cap
almost
completely
cov
ered
her
withered
and
shrunken
face
The
bath-chair
stopped
before
the
verandah
Ipa
tov
went
out
of
the
drawing-room
his
little
daughters
ran
out
after
him
They
had
been
scurrying
from
room
to
room
like
mice
all
the
evening
I
wish
you
good-evening
mother
said
Ipatov
going
up
to
the
old
lady
and
raising
his
voice
How
do
you
feel
I
have
come
to
have
a
look
at
you
the
old
lady
enunciated
with
an
efifort
in
a
tone
less
voice
What
a
lovely
evening
I
have
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
been
asleep
all
day
and
now
my
legs
are
ach
ing
Ah
my
legs
They
are
no
use
and
they
ache
Allow
me
to
present
to
you
mother
our
neighbour
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Astahov
Delighted
said
the
old
lady
turning
upon
him
her
big
black
lustreless
eyes
I
hope
you
will
be
friends
with
my
son
He
is
a
good
man
I
gave
him
all
the
education
I
could
of
course
I
am
only
a
woman
He
is
a
bit
weak
yet
but
with
time
he
will
grow
steadier
it's
high
time
he
did
it
's
time
for
me
to
hand
things
over
to
him
Is
that
you
Nadya
shf
added
looking
at
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
Yes
Grandmamma
And
is
Masha
pouring
out
tea
Yes
Grandmamma
And
who
else
is
there
Ivan
Ilyitch
and
Yegor
Kapitonitch
Matryona
Markovna
's
husband
Yes
Grandmamma
The
old
lady
chewed
her
lips
Well
Misha
I
ca
n't
get
at
the
village
elder
tell
him
to
come
to
me
early
to-morrow
I
have
a
great
deal
of
business
to
do
with
him
Everything
goes
wrong
without
me
I
see
Well
that
's
enough
I
am
llred
take
me
home
Good-bye
sir
I
ca
n't
remember
your
name
she
added
addressing
Vladimir
Sergeitch
you
must
forgive
an
old
woman
And
do
n't
come
with
me
grandchildren
there's
no
need
All
you
think
of
is
to
be
running
about
Sit
still
sit
still
and
learn
your
les
sons
do
you
hear
Masha
spoils
you
Come
set
off
The
old
lady
's
head
raised
with
difficulty
sank
back
upon
her
breast
The
bath-chair
started
and
moved
slowly
away
How
old
is
your
mother
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
She
is
only
seventy-two
but
she
lost
the
use
of
her
legs
twenty-six
years
ago
it
hap
pened
to
her
soon
after
my
father
's
death
But
she
was
a
beauty
Everyone
was
silent
All
at
once
Nadyezhda
Alexycvna
started
What
's
that
I
believe
it
was
a
bat
Oh
how
horrid
And
she
went
hurriedly
back
into
the
drawing-room
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
It
is
time
for
me
to
go
home
Mihail
Nikolaitch
tell
them
to
saddle
my
horse
It
's
time
for
me
to
go
too
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Why
should
you
go
said
Ipatov
Stay
the
night
here
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
has
only
a
mile
and
a
half
to
go
but
you
have
nine
And
why
are
you
in
a
hurry
Nadyezhda
Alex
yevna
Wait
for
the
moon
it
will
soon
be
up
It
will
be
lighter
riding
then
Perhaps
replied
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
it
is
a
long
time
since
I
have
been
for
a
ride
by
moonlight
And
will
you
stay
the
night
said
Ipatov
addressing
himself
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
I
really
do
n't
know
But
if
I
am
not
in
the
way
Not
in
the
least
I
assure
you
I
win
bid
them
prepare
a
room
for
you
at
once
It
is
nice
riding
by
moonlight
began
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
as
soon
as
they
had
brought
the
candles
and
handed
the
tea
and
Ipatov
and
Yegor
Kapitonitch
had
sat
down
to
a
game
of
two-handed
preference
and
the
Adjustable
Soul
had
installed
himself
beside
them
without
uttering
a
word
especially
through
woods
between
the
nut
bushes
It's
uncanny
and
delightful
and
there
is
a
strange
play
of
light
and
shadow
one
feels
as
though
someone
were
lurking
behind
or
in
front
Vladimir
Sergeitch
gave
a
condescending
smile
And
has
it
happened
to
you
she
went
on
to
sit
on
a
warm
dark
still
night
near
a
wood
It
always
seems
to
me
then
as
though
two
voices
were
arguing
hotly
in
a
faint
whisper
behind
me
close
to
my
ear
That
's
the
throbbing
of
the
blood
ob
served
Ipatov
Your
description
is
very
poetical
ob
served
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
looked
at
him
You
think
so
In
that
case
my
de
scriptions
would
not
please
Iasha
Why
so
Does
n't
Marya
Pavlovna
like
