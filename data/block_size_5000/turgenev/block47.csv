a
look
of
sadness
and
complete
detachment
such
a
look
of
being
ut
terly
broken
as
it
is
called
The
features
of
his
face
were
of
the
ordinary
country
type
a
wrinkled
forehead
little
grey
eyes
a
thick
nose
a
wedge-shaped
beard
a
swarthy
sun
burnt
skin
But
the
expression
the
expres
sion
There
was
but
a
faint
melancholy
glim
mer
of
life
in
his
lustreless
eyes
his
voice
too
seemed
colourless
and
scarcely
living
I
was
taken
ill
and
laid
up
for
a
few
days
Father
Alexey
used
to
come
and
see
me
in
the
eve
nings
not
to
talk
but
to
play
a
game
of
cards
called
fools
Playing
cards
seemed
to
en
tertain
him
even
more
than
me
One
evening
after
having
been
made
the
fool
several
times
in
succession
at
which
Father
Alexey
was
much
gratified
I
began
talking
of
his
past
life
of
the
troubles
which
had
left
on
him
such
unmistakable
traces
Father
Alexey
held
back
for
a
long
time
but
ended
by
telling
me
his
story
He
must
have
taken
a
liking
to
me
or
he
would
not
have
been
so
open
with
me
I
will
try
and
repeat
his
story
in
his
own
words
Father
Alexey
spoke
very
simply
and
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
clearly
without
any
clerical
or
provincial
man
nerisms
or
phrases
I
have
observed
more
than
once
that
Russians
of
all
classes
who
have
gone
through
a
great
deal
and
have
learned
resigna
tion
express
themselves
just
in
that
language
I
had
a
good
and
sensible
wife
was
how
he
began
I
loved
her
from
my
heart
and
we
had
eight
children
but
almost
all
of
them
died
when
they
were
little
One
of
my
sons
became
a
bishop
and
died
not
long
ago
in
his
diocese
about
my
other
son
Yakov
I
am
going
to
tell
you
now
I
sent
him
to
the
semi
nary
in
the
town
of
T
and
soon
began
re
ceiving
the
most
gratifying
reports
of
him
he
was
the
top
of
his
class
in
all
the
subjects
At
home
as
a
child
he
had
been
remarkable
for
his
studiousness
and
modesty
sometimes
you
would
hear
nothing
of
him
all
day
he
would
be
sitting
at
his
book
reading
He
never
caused
his
mother
or
me
the
slightest
annoy
ance
he
was
always
a
good
boy
Only
some
times
he
was
too
thoughtful
for
his
age
his
health
was
frail
One
day
something
strange
happened
to
him
He
was
ten
years
old
at
the
time
He
left
home
at
dawn
it
was
the
eve
of
St
Peter
's
day
and
was
away
almost
the
whole
morning
At
last
he
came
back
My
wife
and
I
asked
him
where
he
had
been
I
went
for
a
walk
in
the
forest
he
told
us
and
there
I
met
a
little
green
old
man
who
talked
to
me
a
great
deal
and
gave
me
such
delicious
nuts
What
little
green
old
man
we
asked
him
I
do
n't
know
he
said
I
have
never
seen
him
before
He
is
a
little
hunchbacked
old
man
he
keeps
laughing
and
his
feet
are
never
itill
and
he
is
green
as
a
leaf
all
over
What
we
said
was
his
face
green
too
Yes
his
face
and
his
hair
and
even
his
eyes
Our
son
had
neVer
told
a
lie
but
this
time
my
wife
and
I
were
doubtful
You
must
have
fallen
asleep
in
the
forest
in
the
heat
and
dreamed
of
the
old
man
I
did
n't
go
to
sleep
not
a
wink
he
said
Why
do
n't
you
believe
me
Why
I
have
one
of
the
nuts
left
in
my
pocket
Yakov
took
the
nut
out
of
his
pocket
and
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
showed
it
us
It
had
a
small
kernel
some
thing
like
a
chestnut
with
a
rough
skin
it
was
not
like
our
ordinary
nuts
I
put
it
away
I
wanted
to
show
it
to
the
doctor
but
it
was
lost
I
could
not
find
it
afterwards
Well
we
sent
him
to
the
seminary
and
as
I
have
told
you
already
he
delighted
us
with
his
success
So
my
wife
and
I
expected
he
would
turn
out
well
When
he
came
home
for
his
holidays
it
was
a
pleasure
to
look
at
him
there
was
so
much
goodness
in
his
face
and
there
was
no
fault
you
could
find
with
him
Only
he
was
thin
and
there
was
no
proper
colour
in
his
face
Well
he
reached
his
nine
teenth
year
and
his
studies
were
nearly
over
And
all
at
once
we
got
a
letter
from
him
He
wrote
to
us
Father
and
mother
do
not
be
angry
with
me
allow
me
to
take
up
a
secular
calling
my
heart
is
not
in
the
vocation
of
a
priest
I
am
terrified
at
the
responsibility
I
am
afraid
of
sin
doubts
have
begun
to
stir
in
me
Without
your
parental
permission
and
blessing
T
shall
not
venture
on
anything
but
I
will
tell
you
one
thing
I
am
afraid
of
my
self
for
I
have
begun
to
think
a
great
deal
I
must
tell
you
sir
I
was
terribly
grieved
at
this
letter
it
was
like
a
stab
in
the
heart
for
I
saw
I
should
oot
have
anyone
to
take
my
place
after
me
Lly
elder
son
was
a
monk
and
this
one
wanted
to
leave
the
priesthood
altogether
It
was
a
grief
to
me
too
because
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
the
priests
in
this
parish
have
been
of
our
family
However
I
thought
it
was
no
use
kicking
against
the
pricks
it
seemed
that
this
was
ordained
for
him
What
sort
of
pas
tor
would
he
make
if
he
had
let
doubts
assail
him
I
took
council
with
my
wife
and
I
wrote
to
him
in
this
sense
Yakov
my
son
think
it
over
well
measure
ten
times
before
you
cut
once
there
are
great
difficulties
in
a
secular
calling
cold
and
hunger
and
contempt
for
our
class
And
you
must
understand
that
no
one
will
give
you
a
helping
hand
mind
you
don't
repent
too
late
My
desire
as
you
know
has
always
been
that
you
should
succeed
me
here
but
if
you
really
doubt
of
your
vocation
and
your
faith
has
been
shaken
it
is
not
for
me
to
try
and
compel
you.V
God
's
will
be
done
Your
mother
and
I
do
not
refuse
you
our
blessing
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
Yakov
answered
me
with
a
grateful
letter
You
have
relieved
me
father
he
wrote
it
is
my
intention
to
devote
myself
to
a
learned
career
and
I
have
help
promised
me
I
shall
enter
the
University
and
become
a
doctor
for
I
feel
a
great
inclination
for
science
I
read
Yasha
's
letter
and
was
more
grieved
than
ever
and
soon
I
had
no
one
to
share
my
sorrow
my
old
wife
caught
cold
about
that
time
and
died
whether
of
the
cold
or
because
the
Lord
took
her
in
His
mercy
I
can
not
tell
I
wept
and
wept
in
my
solitary
bereavement
but
t
here
was
no
help
for
it
So
it
was
to
be
it
seems
I
should
have
been
glad
to
be
under
the
soil
too
but
the
earth
was
hard
it
would
not
open
And
I
was
expecting
my
son
for
he
sent
me
word
'before
I
go
to
Mos
cow
I
shall
come
home
to
see
you
And
he
did
indeed
come
home
but
he
did
not
stay
long
Something
seemed
urging
him
on
it
seemed
as
though
he
longed
to
fly
to
Moscow
to
his
be
loved
University
I
began
questioning
him
about
his
doubts
and
asked
him
what
was
the
reason
of
them
but
I
could
not
get
much
talk
out
of
him
his
mind
was
pos
sessed
by
one
idea
and
that
was
all
'I
want
to
help
my
fellow-creatures
he
said
Well
he
went
away
he
scarcely
took
a
farthing
with
him
nothing
but
a
few
clothes
He
had
great
confidence
in
himself
And
not
without
good
reason
He
passed
the
examination
brilliantly
became
a
student
got
lessons
in
private
fam
ilies
He
was
good
at
Greek
and
Latin
And
would
you
believe
it
he
actually
sent
me
money
I
felt
a
little
more
cheerful
not
on
account
of
the
money
of
course
I
sent
it
back
to
him
and
scolded
him
too
I
was
cheered
because
I
saw
he
would
do
well
But
my
cheerfulness
did
not
last
long
He
came
home
for
his
first
vacation
And
it
was
strange
I
hardly
knew
my
Yakov
He
had
become
so
depressed
so
gloomy
there
was
no
getting
a
word
out
of
him
And
his
face
was
changed
too
he
looked
almost
ten
years
older
He
had
always
been
of
a
retiring
dis
position
that
's
true
the
least
thing
and
he
would
be
shy
and
blushing
like
a
girl
But
if
he
raised
his
eyes
you
ould
see
that
his
soul
was
serene
Now
it
was
not
the
same
thing
though
He
was
not
shy
but
like
some
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
wild
creature
like
a
wolf
and
he
looked
at
everyone
from
under
his
brows
Not
a
smile
not
a
greeting
like
a
stone
When
I
tried
to
question
him
he
would
either
say
nothing
or
growl
at
me
I
began
to
wonder
whether
God
forbid
he
had
taken
to
drinking
or
whether
he
had
given
way
to
gambling
or
whether
he
had
got
into
some
trouble
through
weakness
in
regard
to
women
In
youth
the
spell
of
love
is
potent
and
there
are
sure
to
be
bad
examples
and
temptations
in
a
big
town
like
Moscow
But
no
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
to
be
seen
He
drank
nothing
but
water
or
kvass
had
no
eyes
for
the
fair
sex
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
people
in
general
And
what
was
bitterer
than
anything
he
no
longer
put
the
same
confidence
in
me
he
seemed
indifferent
as
though
he
were
sick
of
everything
belonging
to
him
I
would
turn
the
conversation
on
his
studies
on
the
University
but
I
could
get
no
real
answer
out
of
him
He
would
go
to
church
but
there
was
something
strange
about
that
too
everywhere
else
he
was
morose
and
sullen
but
in
church
he
looked
as
though
he
were
grin
ning
all
the
time
He
spent
six
weeks
with
me
Hke
that
and
went
back
to
Moscow
again
He
wfote
to
me
twice
from
Moscow
and
it
seemed
to
me
from
his
letters
as
though
he
were
com
ing
to
himself
again
But
picture
my
amaze
ment
sir
Suddenly
in
the
very
depth
of
win
ter
just
before
Christmas
he
came
home
How
Why
In
what
way
I
knew
that
there
was
no
vacation
at
that
time
Have
you
come
from
Moscow
I
asked
Yes
And
how
about
the
University
I
have
given
up
the
University
Given
it
up
Yes
For
good
Yes
for
good
Are
you
ill
then
or
what
Yakov
No
father
he
said
I
am
not
ill
only
do
n't
worry
me
with
your
questions
father
or
I
shall
go
away
from
here
and
you
will
never
see
me
again
Yako.v
said
he
was
not
ill
but
I
was
h6rrified
at
the
look
of
his
face
His
cheeks
were
drawn
so
that
the
bones
stuck
out
he
was
all
skin
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
and
bones
his
voice
had
a
hollow
note
like
a
barrel
and
his
eyes
good
God
what
eyes
Fierce
wild
continually
roving
so
that
you
could
never
catch
them
his
brows
were
knit
his
lips
too
seemed
twisted
on
one
side
What
had
become
of
my
beloved
Joseph
my
gentle
boy
I
could
n't
imagine
Is
he
out
of
his
mind
I
wondered
He
wandered
about
like
an
uneasy
spirit
did
not
sleep
at
night
and
all
of
a
sudden
would
stare
into
a
corner
and
seem
to
grow
stiff
with
terror
It
was
uncanny
Though
he
did
threaten
me
that
he
would
not
stay
if
I
asked
him
questions
yet
I
was
his
father
My
last
hope
was
being
shattered
and
was
I
to
keep
silent
One
day
choosing
my
time
I
began
imploring
Yakov
with
tears
entreating
him
for
the
sake
of
his
mother
Tell
me
your
father
in
flesh
and
in
spirit
Yasha
what
is
wrong
with
you
Don't
destroy
me
explain
open
your
heart
Have
you
slain
some
Christian
soul
perhaps
Then
repent
Well
father
he
said
all
at
once
it
was
in
the
evening
you
have
touched
my
heart
I
will
tell
you
the
whole
truth
I
have
hurt
no
other
soul
but
my
own
is
being
lost
In
what
way
It
's
like
this
and
Yakov
raised
his
eyes
to
me
for
the
first
time
for
the
last
four
months
he
began
but
all
at
once
his
voice
broke
and
he
began
breathing
hard
What
is
it
for
the
last
four
months
Tell
me
do
n't
torture
me
For
the
last
four
months
I
have
been
seeing
him
Him
What
him
Why
him
whose
name
one
ca
n't
utter
at
night
I
turned
cold
all
over
and
began
to
tremble
What
I
said
do
you
see
himt
Yes
And
do
you
see
him
now
Yes
Where
And
I
did
not
dare
to
turn
round
myself
and
we
both
spoke
in
a
whisper
Over
there
he
said
and
showed
me
with
his
eyes
over
there
in
the
corner
Father
alexey
's
story
I
plucked
up
my
spirit
and
looked
into
the
corner
there
was
nothing
there
But
there
's
nothing
there
Yakov
really
You
do
n't
see
him
but
I
do
I
looked
again
again
there
was
nothing
I
suddenly
thought
of
the
little
old
man
in
the
wood
who
gave
him
the
nut
What
is
he
Hke
I
said
Green
No
not
green
black
With
horns
No
he
is
like
a
man
but
all
black
As
Yakov
spoke
his
mouth
was
twisted
so
that
his
teeth
showed
he
was
pale
as
death
and
he
huddled
up
to
me
in
terror
his
eyes
seemed
as
though
they
were
starting
out
of
his
head
but
he
still
looked
into
the
corner
That
's
the
shadow
makes
you
fancy
it
I
said
it
's
the
blackness
of
the
shadow
and
you
take
it
for
a
human
form
Not
at
all
I
see
his
eyes
there
he
is
show
ing
the
whites
of
his
eyes
there
he
is
lifting
his
hands
and
beckoning
'^Yakov
Yakov
you
should
try
and
pray
it
would
break
the
spell
Let
the
Lord
arise
and
His
enemies
be
scattered
Z7
I
have
tried
he
said
but
it
is
no
use
Wait
wait
Yakov
do
n't
be
faint-hearted
I
will
burn
incense
I
will
say
a
prayer
I
will
sprinkle
holy
water
around
you
Yakov
merely
waved
his
hand
in
despair
I
do
n't
believe
in
your
incense
nor
in
your
holy
water
they
are
not
a
hap'orth
of
use
to
me
now
There
's
no
parting
from
htm
for
me
now
Since
he
came
to
me
on3
cursed
day
in
summer
he
has
been
my
constant
visitor
and
there
is
no
getting
rid
of
him
Understand
that
father
and
do
n't
be
surprised
at
my
be
haviour
and
do
n't
torment
me
What
day
did
he
come
to
you
I
asked
and
I
kept
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
Was
it
when
you
were
writing
to
me
about
your
doubts
Yakov
put
aside
my
hand
Leave
me
alone
father
he
said
don't
make
me
angry
for
fear
worse
may
happen
I
am
not
far
from
laying
hands
on
myself
You
can
imagine
sir
what
it
was
for
me
to
hear
that
I
remember
I
cried
all
night
How
have
I
deserved
the
wrath
of
God
I
wondered
Here

out

nothing
else
but
the
dread
that
he
should
run
away
or
God
forbid
do
himself
some
mischief
I
kept
watch
over
every
step
he
took
but
I
was
afraid
of
talking
to
him
At
that
time
there
was
living
near
us
a
lady
the
widow
of
a
colonel
called
Marfa
Savvishna
I
had
a
great
respect
for
her
for
she
was
a
gentle
and
sensible
woman
though
she
was
young
and
of
prepossessing
appear
ance
I
used
to
visit
her
often
and
she
did
not
despise
me
for
being
a
priest
In
my
grief
and
misery
not
knowing
what
to
do
I
went
and
told
her
all
about
it
At
first
she
was
horrified
and
quite
overwhelmed
and
then
she
began
to
think
For
a
long
time
she
sat
silent
and
then
she
expressed
a
desire
to
see
my
son
and
talk
to
him
And
I
felt
at
once
that
I
must
do
as
she
wished
for
it
was
no
feminine
curiosity
that
prompted
her
request
but
something
else
When
I
got
home
I
began
persuading
Yakov
Come
with
me
to
see
the
colonel
's
lady
He
would
n't
hear
of
it
I
wo
n't
he
said
noth
ing
would
induce
me
What
could
I
talk
to
her
about
He
even
shouted
at
me
How
ever
I
succeeded
in
persuading
him
at
last
and
putting
the
horse
in
the
sledge
I
took
him
to
Marfa
Savvishna
and
as
arranged
left
him
alone
with
her
I
was
surprised
myself
that
he
had
agreed
so
soon
Never
mind
we
shall
see
what
comes
of
it
I
thought
Three
or
four
hours
later
my
Yakov
came
back
WeU
I
asked
him
how
did
you
like
our
neighbour
He
made
no
answer
I
tried
again
She
is
a
virtuous
lady
I
said
I
suppose
she
was
kind
to
you
Yes
he
said
she
is
not
like
other
people
I
saw
he
seemed
to
be
softer
and
I
ventured
to
ask
him
about
his
affliction
The
look
in
Yakov
's
eye
was
like
the
lash
of
a
whip
and
again
he
said
nothing
I
did
not
trouble
him
further
and
went
out
of
the
room
an
hour
later
I
went
to
the
door
looked
through
the
key-hole
and
what
do
you
think
My
Yakov
was
asleep
He
was
lying
asleep
on
his
bed
I
crossed
myself
several
times
May
God
shower
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
every
blessing
upon
Marfa
Savvishna
I
thought
So
the
dear
woman
had
succeeded
in
touching
his
hardened
heart
Next
day
I
saw
Yakov
take
his
cap
I
thought
of
asking
where
he
was
going
but
no
better
not
ask
no
doubt
it
is
to
her
And
it
really
was
to
Marfa
Savvishna
that
Yakov
went
and
he
stayed
longer
still
and
the
next
day
he
went
again
and
then
a
day
later
again
My
spirit
began
to
revive
for
I
saw
a
change
in
my
son
his
face
was
different
and
one
could
look
into
his
eyes
he
did
not
turn
away
His
depression
was
still
there
but
the
despair
the
horror
had
gone
But
I
had
hardly
begun
to
be
more
hopeful
when
every
thing
was
shattered
again
Yakov
became
like
a
wild
creature
again
there
was
no
going
near
him
He
sat
shut
up
all
day
in
his
room
and
went
no
more
to
the
colonel
's
widow
Had
he
offended
her
in
some
way
I
wondered
and
had
she
forbidden
him
the
house
But
no
I
thought
though
he
is
afflicted
he
would
not
venture
on
that
and
besides
she
is
not
that
sort
of
woman
I
could
not
refrain
from
ask
ing
him
at
last
What
about
our
neighbour
Yakov
You
seem
to
have
quite
forgotten
her
And
he
positively
shouted
at
me
Our
neighbour
Do
you
want
him
to
laugh
at
me
What
I
said
But
he
clenched
his
fists
and
vras
quite
savage
Yes
he
said
he
used
only
to
stand
there
but
now
he
has
taken
to
laughing
and
grinning
Get
away
go
To
whom
he
addressed
those
words
I
don't
know
I
could
hardly
stagger
out
of
the
room
I
was
so
frightened
Only
imagine
his
face
was
as
red
as
copper
he
was
foaming
at
the
mouth
his
voice
was
hoarse
as
though
some
one
was
suffocating
him
I
went
off
feeling
utterly
desolate
to
Mar
fa
Savvishna
that
very
day
I
found
her
in
great
distress
Her
very
appearance
was
changed
she
was
thinner
in
the
face
But
she
would
not
talk
to
me
about
my
son
She
only
said
one
thing
that
no
hu
man
help
could
be
of
any
avail
You
must
pray
father
And
then
she
gave
me
a
hundred
roubles
for
the
poor
and
sick
of
my
parish
and

FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
again
repeated
pray
My
God
as
though
I
did
not
pray
day
and
night
as
it
was
Father
Alexey
took
out
his
handkerchief
again
and
wiped
away
his
tears
this
time
openly
after
a
brief
pause
he
went
on
with
his
sad
story
After
that
we
went
from
bad
to
worse
Hke
a
snowball
rolling
down
hill
we
could
see
there
was
a
precipice
at
the
bottom
but
we
could
not
stop
ourselves
And
there
was
no
con
cealing
it
there
was
great
commotion
in
the
whole
parish
because
the
priest
's
son
was
pos
sessed
by
the
devil
People
said
that
the
au
thorities
ought
to
be
informed
of
it
And
they
would
have
informed
them
no
doubt
but
my
parishioners
God
bless
them
for
it
were
sorry
for
me
Meanwhile
the
winter
was
over
and
spring
had
come
And
the
Lord
sent
us
such
a
beautiful
fine
spring
as
even
the
old
people
did
not
remember
the
sun
shone
all
day
it
was
warm
and
still
And
a
happy
thought
came
to
me
to
persuade
Yakov
to
go
with
me
on
a
pilgrimage
to
St
Alitrofany
's
at
Voronezh
If
that
last
resource
is
of
no
avail
I
thought
then
the
only
hope
is
the
grave
Well
I
was
sitting
one
evening
on
the
steps
of
the
porch
there
was
a
glow
of
sunset
in
the
sky
the
larks
were
singing
the
apple
blos
som
was
out
the
grass
was
green
I
sat
and
wondered
how
to
tell
Yakov
of
my
plan
All
at
once
I
saw
him
coming
out
on
to
the
steps
he
stood
and
looked
heaved
a
sigh
and
squatted
on
the
step
beside
me
I
was
quite
frightened
with
joy
but
I
did
not
say
a
word
And
he
sat
looked
at
the
sunset
and
was
silent
too
And
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
he
were
in
a
softened
mood
The
wrinkles
were
smoothed
on
his
forehead
even
his
eyes
were
clearer
it
looked
as
though
tears
were
almost
coming
into
them
Seeing
such
a
change
in
him
I
confess
I
grew
bolder
Yakov
I
said
hear
what
I
have
to
say
and
do
n't
be
angry
And
I
told
him
of
my
plan
of
how
we
should
go
on
foot
together
to
St
Mitro
fany
's
it
was
about
a
hundred
miles
from
us
to
Voronezh
and
how
pleasant
it
would
be
for
the
two
of
us
getting
up
before
the
sunrise
to
go
on
and
on
in
the
cool
of
the
spring
through
the
green
grass
in
the
high-road
and
I
told
him
that
if
we
fall
down
and
pray
at
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
the
shrine
of
the
saint
perhaps
who
knows
the
Lord
God
may
have
mercy
on
us
and
he
may
be
healed
of
which
there
have
been
many
examples
And
imagine
my
happiness
sir
Very
good
said
Yakov
and
he
did
turn
round
but
kept
looking
at
the
sky
I
agree
Let
us
go
I
was
overwhelmed
My
dear
I
said
my
darling
thank
you
He
asked
me
When
are
we
going
To-morrow
if
you
like
I
said
So
next
day
we
set
off
We
put
wallets
on
our
backs
took
staves
in
our
hands
and
started
We
walked
for
seven
whole
days
and
all
the
time
the
weather
was
propitious
It
was
won
derful
There
was
no
rain
and
it
was
not
too
hot
the
flies
did
not
bite
us
and
the
dust
was
not
annoying
And
my
Yakov
looked
better
every
day
I
must
tell
you
that
in
the
open
air
Yakov
never
saw
him
but
he
felt
his
pres
ence
behind
him
just
at
his
back
or
his
shadow
would
glide
by
him
which
troubled
my
son
very
much
But
this
time
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
and
at
the
inns
where
we
stayed
the
night
he
saw
nothing
either
We
did
not
talk
much
but
how
happy
we
were
especially
I
I
saw
my
poor
boy
coming
back
to
life
I
can
not
describe
sir
what
I
felt
then
Well
we
reached
Voronezh
at
last
We
washed
and
made
ourselves
clean
and
went
to
the
Ca
thedral
to
the
shrine
of
the
saint
For
three
whole
days
we
scarcely
left
the
Cathedral
How
many
special
services
we
had
said
for
us
how
many
candles
we
set
up
and
all
went
smoothly
and
well
our
days
were
devout
our
nights
were
tranquil
my
Yasha
slept
like
a
baby
He
began
talking
to
me
of
his
own
accord
He
would
ask
me
Father
do
you
see
anything
while
he
smiled
I
see
nothing
I
would
re
ply
Nor
I
either
he
would
say
What
more
could
I
desire
My
gratitude
to
the
saint
knew
no
bounds
Three
days
passed
and
I
said
to
Yakov
Well
now
my
boy
things
are
better
it
is
a
happy
day
for
us
There
is
only
one
thing
left
to
do
make
your
confession
and
take
the
sacrament
and
then
let
us
go
home
in
God's
name
and
after
a
good
rest
and
working
on
the
land
to
restore
your
strength
we
can
begin
to
look
about
us
and
find
a
post
or
something
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
Marfa
Savvishna
will
be
sure
to
help
us
in
that
No
said
Yakov
why
should
we
trouble
her
I
will
take
her
a
ring
from
St
Mjtrof
any's
shrine
I
was
quite
carried
away
Mind
you
take
a
silver
and
not
a
gold
one
not
a
betrothal
ring
I
said
My
Yakov
flushed
and
only
repeated
We
must
not
trouble
her
but
he
agreed
to
every
thing
at
once
We
went
next
day
to
the
Cathedral
my
Yakov
went
to
confession
and
how
earnestl
he
prayed
before
that
and
then
he
went
to
the
sacrament
I
stood
a
little
apart
and
could
hardly
feel
the
earth
tinder
my
feet
The
angels
in
heaven
are
not
happier
than
I
was
Only
I
looked
and
wondered
what
it
meant
my
Yakov
had
taken
the
sacrament
but
he
did
not
go
to
drink
the
wine
afterwards
He
stood
with
his
back
to
me
Yakov
I
said
to
him
why
are
you
stand
ing
still
He
turned
round
sharply
and
would
you
be
lieve
it
I
stepped
back
I
was
so
frightened
his
face
sometimes
looked
dreadful
but
now
it
had
become
savage
and
terrible
He
was
pale
as
death
his
hair
was
standing
on
end
his
eyes
were
squinting
my
voice
failed
me
from
terror
I
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
I
almost
swooned
And
he
simply
dashed
out
of
the
church
I
followed
him
he
went
straight
to
the
inn
where
we
had
slept
the
night
put
his
wallet
on
his
back
and
set
off
Where
are
you
going
I
shouted
Yakov
what
is
the
matter
with
you
Stop
wait
But
not
a
word
did
Yakov
say
in
answer
he
ran
like
a
hare
and
it
was
impossible
to
overtake
him
He
vanished
I
turned
back
at
once
hired
a
cart
I
was
all
of
a
shake
and
could
say
nothing
but
Lord
Lord
And
I
did
not
understand
what
had
happened
to
us
I
made
my
way
home
for
I
felt
sure
that
he
had
gone
there
And
I
did
in
fact
come
upon
him
striding
along
the
high-road
four
miles
from
the
town
I
overtook
him
jumped
out
of
the
cart
and
ran
up
to
him
Yasha
Yasha
He
stopped
turned
round
facing
me
but
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
his
mouth
tightly
shut
And
whatever
I
said
to
him
he
stood
like
a
post
and
FATHER
ALEXEY
'S
STORY
one
could
only
see
he
was
breathing
And
at
last
he
set
off
along
the
road
again
What
could
I
do
I
trudged
after
him
Oh
what
a
journey
that
was
sir
Our
re
turn
was
as
awful
as
our
journey
to
Voronezh
had
been
joyful
If
I
began
talking
to
him
he
would
turn
round
and
snap
with
his
teeth
like
a
tiger
or
hyaena
I
do
not
know
how
it
was
I
did
not
go
out
of
my
mind
then
At
last
one
night
in
a
peasant
's
smoky
hut
he
sat
on
the
sleeping
shelf
dangling
his
legs
and
look
ing
about
him
I
fell
on
my
knees
before
him
and
wept
and
bitterly
prayed
to
him
Don't
kill
your
old
father
outright
do
n't
drive
him
to
despair
tell
me
what
has
happened
to
you
He
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
though
till
then
he
had
looked
as
though
he
had
not
seen
who
was
before
him
and
all
at
once
he
began
to
speak
and
in
such
a
voice
that
it
is
ringing
in
my
ears
till
now
Listen
father
he
said
do
you
want
to
know
the
whole
truth
Here
it
is
for
you
When
I
took
the
sacrament
as
you
remember
and
while
the
consecrated
element
was
still
in
my
mouth
he
suddenly
stood
before
me
as
though
he
had
sprung
out
of
the
ground
in
the
church
in
full
daylight
and
whispered
in
my
ear
and
he
