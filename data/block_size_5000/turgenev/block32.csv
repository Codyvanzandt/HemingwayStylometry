the
hay
scattered
around
smelt
strong
and
was
slightly
damp
through
the
slender
rafters
of
the
half-open
roof
pale
stars
were
faintly
twinkling
I
went
out
The
glow
of
sunset
had
long
died
away
and
its
last
trace
showed
in
a
faint
light
on
the
horizon
but
above
the
freshness
of
the
night
there
was
still
a
feeling
of
heat
in
the
atmosphere
lately
baked
through
by
the
sun
and
the
breast
still
craved
for
a
draught
of
cool
air
There
was
no
wind
nor
were
there
any
clouds
the
sky
all
round
was
clear
and
transparently
dark
softly
glimmering
with
innumerable
but
scarcely
visible
stars
There
were
lights
twinkling
about
the
village
from
the
flaring
tavern
close
by
rose
a
confused
discordant
din
amid
which
I
fancied
I
recognised
the
voice
of
Yakov
Violent
laughter
came
from
there
in
an
outburst
at
times
I
went
up
to
the
little
window
and
pressed
my
face
against
the
pane
I
saw
a
cheerless
though
varied
and
animated
scene
all
were
drunk
all
from
Yakov
upwards
With
breast
bared
he
sat
on
a
bench
and
singing
in
a
thick
voice
a
street
song
to
a
dance-tune
he
lazily
fingered
and
strummed
on
the
strings
of
a
guitar
His
moist
hair
hung
in
tufts
over
his
fearfully
pale
face
In
the
middle
of
the
room
the
Gabbler
completely
'screwed
and
without
his
coat
was
hopping
about
in
a
dance
before
the
peasant
in
the
grey
smock
the
peasant
on
his
side
was
with
difficulty
stamping
and
scraping
with
his
feet
and
grinning
meaninglessly
over
his
dishevelled
beard
he
waved
one
hand
from
time
to
time
as
much
as
to
say
'Here
goes
Nothing
could
be
more
ludicrous
than
his
face
however
much
he
twitched
up
his
eyebrows
his
heavy
lids
would
hardly
rise
but
seemed
lying
upon
his
scarcely
visible
dim
and
mawkish
eyes
He
was
in
that
amiable
frame
of
mind
of
a
perfectly
intoxicated
man
when
every
passer-by
directly
he
looks
him
in
the
face
is
sure
to
say
'Bless
you
brother
bless
you
The
Blinkard
as
red
as
a
lobster
and
his
nostrils
dilated
wide
was
laughing
malignantly
in
a
corner
only
Nikolai
Ivanitch
as
befits
a
good
tavern-keeper
preserved
his
composure
unchanged
The
room
was
thronged
with
many
new
faces
but
the
Wild
Master
I
did
not
see
in
it
I
turned
away
with
rapid
steps
and
began
descending
the
hill
on
which
Kolotovka
lies
At
the
foot
of
this
hill
stretches
a
wide
plain
plunged
in
the
misty
waves
of
the
evening
haze
it
seemed
more
immense
and
was
as
it
were
merged
in
the
darkening
sky
I
walked
with
long
strides
along
the
road
by
the
ravine
when
all
at
once
from
somewhere
far
away
in
the
plain
came
a
boy
's
clear
voice
'Antropka
Antropka-a-a
He
shouted
in
obstinate
and
tearful
desperation
with
long
long
drawing
out
of
the
last
syllable
He
was
silent
for
a
few
instants
and
started
shouting
again
His
voice
rang
out
clear
in
the
still
lightly
slumbering
air
Thirty
times
at
least
he
had
called
the
name
Antropka
When
suddenly
from
the
farthest
end
of
the
plain
as
though
from
another
world
there
floated
a
scarcely
audible
reply
'Wha-a-t
The
boy
's
voice
shouted
back
at
once
with
gleeful
exasperation
'Come
here
devil
woo-od
imp
'What
fo-or
replied
the
other
after
a
long
interval
'Because
dad
wants
to
thrash
you
the
first
voice
shouted
back
hurriedly
The
second
voice
did
not
call
back
again
and
the
boy
fell
to
shouting
Antropka
once
more
His
cries
fainter
and
less
and
less
frequent
still
floated
up
to
my
ears
when
it
had
grown
completely
dark
and
I
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
wood
which
skirts
my
village
and
lies
over
three
miles
from
Kolotovka
'Antropka-a-a
was
still
audible
in
the
air
filled
with
the
shadows
of
night
PIOTR
PETROVITCH
KARATAEV
One
autumn
five
years
ago
I
chanced
when
on
the
road
from
Moscow
to
Tula
to
spend
almost
a
whole
day
at
a
posting
station
for
want
of
horses
I
was
on
the
way
back
from
a
shooting
expedition
and
had
been
so
incautious
as
to
send
my
three
horses
on
in
front
of
me
The
man
in
charge
of
the
station
a
surly
elderly
man
with
hair
hanging
over
his
brows
to
his
very
nose
with
little
sleepy
eyes
answered
all
my
complaints
and
requests
with
disconnected
grumbling
slammed
the
door
angrily
as
though
he
were
cursing
his
calling
in
life
and
going
out
on
the
steps
abused
the
postilions
who
were
sauntering
in
a
leisurely
way
through
the
mud
with
the
weighty
wooden
yokes
on
their
arms
or
sat
yawning
and
scratching
themselves
on
a
bench
and
paid
no
special
attention
to
the
wrathful
exclamations
of
their
superior
I
had
already
sat
myself
down
three
times
to
tea
had
several
times
tried
in
vain
to
sleep
and
had
read
all
the
inscriptions
on
the
walls
and
windows
I
was
overpowered
by
fearful
boredom
In
chill
and
helpless
despair
I
was
staring
at
the
upturned
shafts
of
my
carriage
when
suddenly
I
heard
the
tinkling
of
a
bell
and
a
small
trap
drawn
by
three
jaded
horses
drew
up
at
the
steps
The
new
arrival
leaped
out
of
the
trap
and
shouting
'Horses
and
look
sharp
he
went
into
the
room
While
he
was
listening
with
the
strange
wonder
customary
in
such
cases
to
the
overseer
's
answer
that
there
were
no
horses
I
had
time
to
scan
my
new
companion
from
top
to
toe
with
all
the
greedy
curiosity
of
a
man
bored
to
death
He
appeared
to
be
nearly
thirty
Small-pox
had
left
indelible
traces
on
his
face
which
was
dry
and
yellowish
with
an
unpleasant
coppery
tinge
his
long
blue-black
hair
fell
in
ringlets
on
his
collar
behind
and
was
twisted
into
jaunty
curls
in
front
his
small
swollen
eyes
were
quite
expressionless
a
few
hairs
sprouted
on
his
upper
lip
He
was
dressed
like
a
dissipated
country
gentleman
given
to
frequenting
horse-fairs
in
a
rather
greasy
striped
Caucasian
jacket
a
faded
lilac
silk-tie
a
waistcoat
with
copper
buttons
and
grey
trousers
shaped
like
huge
funnels
from
under
which
the
toes
of
unbrushed
shoes
could
just
be
discerned
He
smelt
strongly
of
tobacco
and
spirits
on
his
fat
red
hands
almost
hidden
in
his
sleeves
could
be
seen
silver
and
Tula
rings
Such
figures
are
met
in
Russia
not
by
dozens
but
by
hundreds
an
acquaintance
with
them
is
not
to
tell
the
truth
productive
of
any
particular
pleasure
but
in
spite
of
the
prejudice
with
which
I
looked
at
the
new-comer
I
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
recklessly
good-natured
and
passionate
expression
of
his
face
'This
gentleman
's
been
waiting
more
than
an
hour
here
too
observed
the
overseer
indicating
me
More
than
an
hour
The
rascal
was
making
fun
of
me
'But
perhaps
he
does
n't
need
them
as
I
do
answered
the
new
comer
'I
know
nothing
about
that
said
the
overseer
sulkily
'Then
is
it
really
impossible
Are
there
positively
no
horses
'Impossible
There
's
not
a
single
horse
'Well
tell
them
to
bring
me
a
samovar
I
'll
wait
a
little
there's
nothing
else
to
be
done
The
new
comer
sat
down
on
the
bench
flung
his
cap
on
the
table
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
hair
'Have
you
had
tea
already
he
inquired
of
me
'Yes
'But
wo
n't
you
have
a
little
more
for
company
I
consented
The
stout
red
samovar
made
its
appearance
for
the
fourth
time
on
the
table
I
brought
out
a
bottle
of
rum
I
was
not
wrong
in
taking
my
new
acquaintance
for
a
country
gentleman
of
small
property
His
name
was
Piotr
Petrovitch
Karataev
We
got
into
conversation
In
less
than
half-an-hour
after
his
arrival
he
was
telling
me
his
whole
life
with
the
most
simple-hearted
openness
'I
'm
on
my
way
to
Moscow
now
he
told
me
as
he
sipped
his
fourth
glass
'there
's
nothing
for
me
to
do
now
in
the
country
'How
so
'Well
it
's
come
to
that
My
property
's
in
disorder
I
've
ruined
my
peasants
I
must
confess
there
have
been
bad
years
bad
harvests
and
all
sorts
of
ill-luck
you
know
Though
indeed
he
added
looking
away
dejectedly
'how
could
I
manage
an
estate
'Why
's
that
'But
no
he
interrupted
me
'there
are
people
like
me
who
make
good
managers
You
see
he
went
on
screwing
his
head
on
one
side
and
sucking
his
pipe
assiduously
'looking
at
me
I
dare
say
you
think
I'm
not
much
but
you
see
I
must
confess
I
've
had
a
very
middling
education
I
was
n't
well
off
I
beg
your
pardon
I
'm
an
open
man
and
if
you
come
to
that
He
did
not
complete
his
sentence
but
broke
off
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
I
began
to
assure
him
that
he
was
mistaken
that
I
was
highly
delighted
to
meet
him
and
so
on
and
then
observed
that
I
should
have
thought
a
very
thorough
education
was
not
indispensable
for
the
good
management
of
property
'Agreed
he
responded
'I
agree
with
you
But
still
a
special
sort
of
disposition
's
essential
There
are
some
may
do
anything
they
like
and
it
's
all
right
but
I
Allow
me
to
ask
are
you
from
Petersburg
or
from
Moscow
'I
'm
from
Petersburg
He
blew
a
long
coil
of
smoke
from
his
nostrils
'And
I
'm
going
in
to
Moscow
to
be
an
official
'What
department
do
you
mean
to
enter
'I
do
n't
know
that
's
as
it
happens
I
'll
own
to
you
I
'm
afraid
of
official
life
one
's
under
responsibility
at
once
I
've
always
lived
in
the
country
I
'm
used
to
it
you
know
but
now
there
's
no
help
for
it
it
's
through
poverty
Oh
poverty
how
I
hate
it
'But
then
you
will
be
living
in
the
capital
'In
the
capital
Well
I
do
n't
know
what
there
is
that
's
pleasant
in
the
capital
We
shall
see
may
be
it
's
pleasant
too
Though
nothing
I
fancy
could
be
better
than
the
country
'Then
is
it
really
impossible
for
you
to
live
at
your
country
place
He
gave
a
sigh
'Quite
impossible
It
's
so
to
say
not
my
own
now
'Why
how
so
'Well
a
good
fellow
there
a
neighbour
is
in
possession
a
bill
of
exchange
Poor
Piotr
Petrovitch
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
thought
a
minute
and
shook
his
head
'Well
I
must
own
though
he
added
after
a
brief
silence
'I
ca
n't
blame
anybody
it
's
my
own
fault
I
was
fond
of
cutting
a
dash
I
am
fond
of
cutting
a
dash
damn
my
soul
'You
had
a
jolly
life
in
the
country
I
asked
him
'I
had
sir
he
responded
emphatically
looking
me
straight
in
the
face
'twelve
harriers
harriers
I
can
tell
you
such
as
you
do
n't
very
often
see
The
last
words
he
uttered
in
a
drawl
with
great
significance
'A
grey
hare
they
'd
double
upon
in
no
time
After
the
red
fox
they
were
devils
regular
serpents
And
I
could
boast
of
my
greyhounds
too
It
's
all
a
thing
of
the
past
now
I
've
no
reason
to
lie
I
used
to
go
out
shooting
too
I
had
a
dog
called
the
Countess
a
wonderful
setter
with
a
first-rate
scent
she
took
everything
Sometimes
I
'd
go
to
a
marsh
and
call
Seek
If
she
refused
you
might
go
with
a
dozen
dogs
and
you
'd
find
nothing
But
when
she
was
after
anything
it
was
a
sight
to
see
her
And
in
the
house
so
well-bred
If
you
gave
her
bread
with
your
left
hand
and
said
A
Jew
's
tasted
it
she
would
n't
touch
it
but
give
it
with
your
right
and
say
The
young
lady
's
had
some
and
she
'd
take
it
and
eat
it
at
once
I
had
a
pup
of
hers
capital
pup
he
was
and
I
meant
to
bring
him
with
me
to
Moscow
but
a
friend
asked
me
for
him
together
with
a
gun
he
said
In
Moscow
you
'll
have
other
things
to
think
of
I
gave
him
the
pup
and
the
gun
and
so
you
know
it
stayed
there
'But
you
might
go
shooting
in
Moscow
'No
what
would
be
the
use
I
did
n't
know
when
to
pull
myself
up
so
now
I
must
grin
and
bear
it
But
there
kindly
tell
me
rather
about
the
living
in
Moscow
is
it
dear
'No
not
very
'Not
very
And
tell
me
please
are
there
any
gypsies
in
Moscow
'What
sort
of
gypsies
'Why
such
as
hang
about
fairs
'Yes
there
are
in
Moscow
'Well
that
's
good
news
I
like
gypsies
damn
my
soul
I
like
'em
And
there
was
a
gleam
of
reckless
merriment
in
Piotr
Petrovitch
's
eyes
But
suddenly
he
turned
round
on
the
bench
then
seemed
to
ponder
dropped
his
eyes
and
held
out
his
empty
glass
to
me
'Give
me
some
of
your
rum
he
said
'But
the
tea
's
all
finished
'Never
mind
as
it
is
without
tea
Ah
h
Karataev
laid
his
head
in
his
hands
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
I
looked
at
him
without
speaking
and
although
I
was
expecting
the
sentimental
exclamations
possibly
even
the
tears
of
which
the
inebriate
are
so
lavish
yet
when
he
raised
his
head
I
was
I
must
own
impressed
by
the
profoundly
mournful
expression
of
his
face
'What
's
wrong
with
you
'Nothing
I
was
thinking
of
old
times
An
anecdote
that
I
would
tell
it
you
but
I
am
ashamed
to
trouble
you
'What
nonsense
'Yes
he
went
on
with
a
sigh
'there
are
cases
like
mine
for
instance
Well
if
you
like
I
will
tell
you
Though
really
I
don't
know
'Do
tell
me
dear
Piotr
Petrovitch
'Very
well
though
it
's
a
Well
do
you
see
he
began
'but
upon
my
word
I
do
n't
know
'Come
that
's
enough
dear
Piotr
Petrovitch
'All
right
This
then
was
what
befel
me
so
to
say
I
used
to
live
in
the
country
All
of
a
sudden
I
took
a
fancy
to
a
girl
Ah
what
a
girl
she
was
handsome
clever
and
so
good
and
sweet
Her
name
was
Matrona
But
she
was
n't
a
lady
that
is
you
understand
she
was
a
serf
simply
a
serf-girl
And
not
my
girl
she
belonged
to
someone
else
that
was
the
trouble
Well
so
I
loved
her
it
's
really
an
incident
that
one
can
hardly
well
and
she
loved
me
too
And
so
Matrona
began
begging
me
to
buy
her
off
from
her
mistress
and
indeed
the
thought
had
crossed
my
mind
too
But
her
mistress
was
a
rich
dreadful
old
body
she
lived
about
twelve
miles
from
me
Well
so
one
fine
day
as
the
saying
is
I
ordered
my
team
of
three
horses
to
be
harnessed
abreast
to
the
droshky
in
the
centre
I
'd
a
first-rate
goer
an
extraordinary
Asiatic
horse
for
that
reason
called
Lampurdos
I
dressed
myself
in
my
best
and
went
off
to
Matrona
's
mistress
I
arrived
it
was
a
big
house
with
wings
and
a
garden
Matrona
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
bend
of
the
road
she
tried
to
say
a
word
to
me
but
she
could
only
kiss
her
hand
and
turn
away
Well
so
I
went
into
the
hall
and
asked
if
the
mistress
were
at
home
And
a
tall
footman
says
to
me
What
name
shall
I
say
I
answered
Say
brother
Squire
Karataev
has
called
on
a
matter
of
business
The
footman
walked
away
I
waited
by
myself
and
thought
I
wonder
how
it
'll
be
I
daresay
the
old
beast
'll
screw
out
a
fearful
price
for
all
she
's
so
rich
Five
hundred
roubles
she
'll
ask
I
should
n't
be
surprised
Well
at
last
the
footman
returned
saying
If
you
please
walk
up
I
followed
him
into
the
drawing-room
A
little
yellowish
old
woman
sat
in
an
armchair
blinking
What
do
you
want
To
begin
with
you
know
I
thought
it
necessary
to
say
how
glad
I
was
to
make
her
acquaintance
You
are
making
a
mistake
I
am
not
the
mistress
here
I
'm
a
relation
of
hers
What
do
you
want
I
remarked
upon
that
I
had
to
speak
to
the
mistress
herself
Marya
Ilyinishna
is
not
receiving
to-day
she
is
unwell
What
do
you
want
There's
nothing
for
it
I
thought
to
myself
so
I
explained
my
position
to
her
The
old
lady
heard
me
out
Matrona
what
Matrona
Matrona
Fedorovna
Kulik
's
daughter
Fedor
Kulik
's
daughter
But
how
did
you
come
to
know
her
By
chance
And
is
she
aware
of
your
intention
Yes
The
old
lady
was
silent
for
a
minute
Then
Ah
I
'll
let
her
know
it
the
worthless
hussy
she
said
I
was
astounded
I
must
confess
What
ever
for
upon
my
word
I
'm
ready
to
pay
a
good
sum
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
name
it
'The
old
hag
positively
hissed
at
me
A
surprising
idea
you've
concocted
there
as
though
we
needed
your
money
I
'll
teach
her
I'll
show
her
I
'll
beat
the
folly
out
of
her
The
old
lady
choked
with
spitefulness
Was
n't
she
well
off
with
us
pray
Ah
she
's
a
little
devil
God
forgive
my
transgressions
I
fired
up
I
'll
confess
What
are
you
threatening
the
poor
girl
for
How
is
she
to
blame
The
old
lady
crossed
herself
Ah
Lord
have
mercy
on
me
do
you
suppose
I
'd
But
she
's
not
yours
you
know
Well
Marya
Ilyinishna
knows
best
about
that
it
's
not
your
business
my
good
sir
but
I
'll
show
that
chit
of
a
Matrona
whose
serf
she
is
I
'll
confess
I
almost
fell
on
the
damned
old
woman
but
I
thought
of
Matrona
and
my
hands
dropped
I
was
more
frightened
than
I
can
tell
you
I
began
entreating
the
old
lady
Take
what
you
like
I
said
But
what
use
is
she
to
you
I
like
her
good
ma'am
put
yourself
in
my
position
Allow
me
to
kiss
your
little
hand
And
I
positively
kissed
the
wretch
's
hand
Well
mumbled
the
old
witch
I
'll
tell
Marya
Ilyinishna
it
's
for
her
to
decide
you
come
back
in
a
couple
of
days
I
went
home
in
great
uneasiness
I
began
to
suspect
that
I
'd
managed
the
thing
badly
that
I
'd
been
wrong
in
letting
her
notice
my
state
of
mind
but
I
thought
of
that
too
late
Two
days
after
I
went
to
see
the
mistress
I
was
shown
into
a
boudoir
There
were
heaps
of
flowers
and
splendid
furniture
the
lady
herself
was
sitting
in
a
wonderful
easy-chair
with
her
head
lolling
back
on
a
cushion
and
the
same
relation
was
sitting
there
too
and
some
young
lady
with
white
eyebrows
and
a
mouth
all
awry
in
a
green
gown
a
companion
most
likely
The
old
lady
said
through
her
nose
Please
be
seated
I
sat
down
She
began
questioning
me
as
to
how
old
I
was
and
where
I
'd
been
in
the
service
and
what
I
meant
to
do
and
all
that
very
condescendingly
and
solemnly
I
answered
minutely
The
old
lady
took
a
handkerchief
off
the
table
flourished
it
fanning
herself
Katerina
Karpovna
informed
me
says
she
of
your
scheme
she
informed
me
of
it
but
I
make
it
my
rule
says
she
not
to
allow
my
people
to
leave
my
service
It
is
improper
and
quite
unsuitable
in
a
well-ordered
house
it
is
not
good
order
I
have
already
given
my
orders
says
she
There
will
be
no
need
for
you
to
trouble
yourself
further
says
she
Oh
no
trouble
really
But
can
it
be
Matrona
Fedorovna
is
so
necessary
to
you
No
says
she
she
is
not
necessary
Then
why
wo
n't
you
part
with
her
to
me
Because
I
do
n't
choose
to
I
do
n't
choose
and
that's
all
about
it
I
've
already
says
she
given
my
orders
she
is
being
sent
to
a
village
in
the
steppes
I
was
thunderstruck
The
old
lady
said
a
couple
of
words
in
French
to
the
young
lady
in
green
she
went
out
I
am
says
she
a
woman
of
strict
principles
and
my
health
is
delicate
I
ca
n't
stand
being
worried
You
are
still
young
and
I
'm
an
old
woman
and
entitled
to
give
you
advice
Would
n't
it
be
better
for
you
to
settle
down
get
married
to
look
out
a
good
match
wealthy
brides
are
few
but
a
poor
girl
of
the
highest
moral
character
could
be
found
I
stared
do
you
know
at
the
old
lady
and
did
n't
understand
what
she
was
driving
at
I
could
hear
she
was
talking
about
marriage
but
the
village
in
the
steppes
was
ringing
in
my
ears
all
the
while
Get
married
what
the
devil
Here
he
suddenly
stopped
in
his
story
and
looked
at
me
'You
're
not
married
I
suppose
'No
'There
of
course
I
could
see
it
I
could
n't
stand
it
But
upon
my
word
ma'am
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
How
does
marriage
come
in
I
simply
want
to
know
from
you
whether
you
will
part
with
your
serf-girl
Matrona
or
not
The
old
lady
began
sighing
and
groaning
Ah
he
's
worrying
me
ah
send
him
away
ah
The
relation
flew
to
her
and
began
scolding
me
while
the
lady
kept
on
moaning
What
have
I
done
to
deserve
it
I
suppose
I
'm
not
mistress
in
my
own
house
Ah
ah
I
snatched
my
hat
and
ran
out
of
the
house
like
a
madman
'Perhaps
he
continued
'you
will
blame
me
for
being
so
warmly
attached
to
a
girl
of
low
position
I
do
n't
mean
to
justify
myself
exactly
either
but
so
it
came
to
pass
Would
you
believe
it
I
had
no
rest
by
day
or
by
night
I
was
in
torment
Besides
I
thought
I
have
ruined
the
poor
girl
At
times
I
thought
that
she
was
herding
geese
in
a
smock
and
being
ill-treated
by
her
mistress
's
orders
and
the
bailiff
a
peasant
in
tarred
boots
reviling
her
with
foul
abuse
I
positively
fell
into
a
cold
sweat
Well
I
could
not
stand
it
I
found
out
what
village
she
had
been
sent
to
mounted
my
horse
and
set
off
I
only
got
there
the
evening
of
the
next
day
Evidently
they
hadn't
expected
such
a
proceeding
on
my
part
and
had
given
no
order
in
regard
to
me
I
went
straight
to
the
bailiff
as
though
I
were
a
neighbour
I
go
into
the
yard
and
look
around
there
was
Matrona
sitting
on
the
steps
leaning
on
her
elbow
She
was
on
the
point
of
crying
out
but
I
held
up
my
finger
and
pointed
outside
towards
the
open
country
I
went
into
the
hut
I
chatted
away
a
bit
to
the
bailiff
told
him
ten
thousand
lies
seized
the
right
moment
and
went
out
to
Matrona
She
poor
girl
fairly
hung
round
my
neck
She
was
pale
and
thin
my
poor
darling
I
kept
saying
to
her
do
you
know
There
it
's
all
right
Matrona
it
's
all
right
do
n't
cry
and
my
own
tears
simply
flowed
and
flowed
Well
at
last
though
I
was
ashamed
I
said
to
her
Matrona
tears
are
no
help
in
trouble
but
we
must
act
as
they
say
resolutely
you
must
run
away
with
me
that
's
how
we
must
act
Matrona
fairly
swooned
away
How
can
it
be
I
shall
be
ruined
they
will
be
the
death
of
me
altogether
You
silly
who
will
find
you
They
will
find
me
they
will
be
sure
to
find
me
Thank
you
Piotr
Petrovitch
I
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
but
now
you
must
leave
me
such
is
my
fate
it
seems
Ah
Matrona
Matrona
I
thought
you
were
a
girl
of
character
And
indeed
she
had
a
great
deal
of
character
She
had
a
heart
a
heart
of
gold
Why
should
you
be
left
here
It
makes
no
difference
things
ca
n't
be
worse
Come
tell
me
you
've
felt
the
bailiff
's
fists
eh
Matrona
fairly
crimsoned
and
her
lips
trembled
But
there
'll
be
no
living
for
my
family
on
my
account
Why
your
family
now
will
they
send
them
for
soldiers
Yes
they
'll
send
my
brother
for
a
soldier
And
your
father
Oh
they
wo
n't
send
father
he
's
the
only
good
tailor
among
us
There
you
see
and
it
wo
n't
kill
your
brother
Would
you
believe
it
I
'd
hard
work
to
persuade
her
she
even
brought
forward
a
notion
that
I
might
have
to
answer
for
it
But
that
's
not
your
affair
said
I
However
I
did
carry
her
off
not
that
time
but
another
one
night
I
came
with
a
light
cart
and
carried
her
off
'You
carried
her
off
'Yes
Well
so
she
lived
in
my
house
It
was
a
little
house
and
I'd
few
servants
My
people
I
will
tell
you
frankly
respected
me
they
would
n't
have
betrayed
me
for
any
reward
I
began
to
be
as
happy
as
a
prince
Matrona
rested
and
recovered
and
I
grew
devoted
to
her
And
what
a
girl
she
was
It
seemed
to
come
by
nature
She
could
sing
and
dance
and
play
the
guitar
I
did
n't
show
her
to
my
neighbours
I
was
afraid
they
'd
gossip
But
there
was
one
fellow
my
bosom
friend
Gornostaev
Panteley
you
do
n't
know
him
He
was
simply
crazy
about
her
he
'd
kiss
her
hand
as
though
she
were
a
lady
he
would
really
And
I
must
tell
you
Gornostaev
was
not
like
me
he
was
a
cultivated
man
had
read
all
Pushkin
sometimes
he
'd
talk
to
Matrona
and
me
so
that
we
pricked
up
our
ears
to
listen
He
taught
her
to
write
such
a
queer
chap
he
was
And
how
I
dressed
her
better
than
the
governor
's
wife
really
I
had
a
pelisse
made
her
of
crimson
velvet
edged
with
fur
Ah
how
that
pelisse
suited
her
It
was
made
by
a
Moscow
madame
in
a
new
fashion
with
a
waist
And
what
a
wonderful
creature
Matrona
was
Sometimes
she
'd
fall
to
musing
and
sit
for
hours
together
looking
at
the
ground
without
stirring
a
muscle
and
I
'd
sit
too
and
look
at
her
and
could
never
gaze
enough
just
as
if
I
were
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
Then
she
would
smile
and
my
heart
would
give
a
jump
as
though
someone
were
tickling
me
Or
else
she
'd
suddenly
fall
to
laughing
joking
dancing
she
would
embrace
me
so
warmly
so
passionately
that
my
head
went
round
From
morning
to
evening
I
thought
of
nothing
but
how
I
could
please
her
And
would
you
believe
it
I
gave
her
presents
simply
to
see
how
pleased
she
would
be
the
darling
all
blushing
with
delight
How
she
would
try
on
my
present
how
she
would
come
back
with
her
new
possession
on
and
kiss
me
Her
father
Kulik
got
wind
of
it
somehow
the
old
man
came
to
see
us
and
how
he
wept
In
that
way
we
lived
for
five
months
and
I
should
have
been
glad
to
live
with
her
for
ever
but
for
my
cursed
ill-luck
Piotr
Petrovitch
stopped
'What
was
it
happened
I
asked
him
sympathetically
He
waved
his
hand
'Everything
went
to
the
devil
I
was
the
ruin
of
her
too
My
little
Matrona
was
passionately
fond
of
driving
in
sledges
and
she
used
to
drive
herself
she
used
to
put
on
her
pelisse
and
her
embroidered
Torzhok
gloves
and
cry
out
with
delight
all
the
way
We
used
to
go
out
sledging
always
in
the
evening
so
as
not
to
meet
any
one
you
know
So
once
it
was
such
a
splendid
day
you
know
frosty
and
clear
and
no
wind
we
drove
out
Matrona
had
the
reins
I
looked
where
she
was
driving
Could
it
be
to
Kukuyevka
her
mistress
's
village
Yes
it
was
to
Kukuyevka
I
said
to
her
You
mad
girl
where
are
you
going
She
gave
me
a
look
over
her
shoulder
and
laughed
Let
me
she
said
for
a
lark
Well
thought
I
come
what
may
To
drive
past
her
mistress
's
house
was
nice
was
n't
it
Tell
me
yourself
was
n't
it
nice
So
we
drove
on
The
shaft-horse
seemed
to
float
through
the
air
and
the
trace-horses
went
I
can
tell
you
like
a
regular
whirlwind
We
were
already
in
sight
of
Kukuyevka
when
suddenly
I
see
an
old
green
coach
crawling
along
with
a
groom
on
the
footboard
up
behind
It
was
the
mistress
the
mistress
driving
towards
us
My
heart
failed
me
but
Matrona
how
she
lashed
the
horses
with
the
reins
and
flew
straight
towards
the
coach
The
coachman
he
you
understand
sees
us
flying
to
meet
him
meant
you
know
to
move
on
one
side
turned
too
sharp
and
upset
the
coach
in
a
snowdrift
The
window
was
broken
the
mistress
shrieked
Ai
ai
ai
ai
ai
ai
The
companion
wailed
Help
help
while
we
flew
by
at
the
best
speed
we
might
We
galloped
on
but
I
thought
Evil
will
come
of
it
I
did
wrong
to
let
her
drive
to
Kukuyevka
And
what
do
you
think
Why
the
mistress
had
recognised
Matrona
and
me
too
the
old
wretch
and
made
a
complaint
against
me
My
runaway
serf-girl
said
she
is
living
at
Mr
Karataev
's
and
thereupon
she
made
a
suitable
present
Lo
and
behold
the
captain
of
police
comes
to
me
and
he
was
a
man
