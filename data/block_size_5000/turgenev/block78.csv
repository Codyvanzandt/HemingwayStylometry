merely
the
maids
and
the
footmen
the
coachman
even
could
hear
it
all
Now
he
s
just
tearing
and
raving
round
he
all
but
gave
me
a
thrashing
he
s
bringing
a
father
s
curse
on
the
scene
now
as
cross
as
a
bear
with
a
sore
head
but
that
s
of
no
importance
Anna
Vassilyevna
s
crushed
but
she
s
much
more
brokenhearted
at
her
daughter
leaving
her
than
at
her
marriage
Uvar
Ivanovitch
flourished
his
fingers
A
mother
he
commented
to
be
sure
Your
nephew
resumed
Shubin
threatens
to
lodge
a
complaint
with
the
Metropolitan
and
the
General-Governor
and
the
Minister
but
it
will
end
by
her
going
A
happy
thought
to
ruin
his
own
daughter
He
ll
crow
a
little
and
then
lower
his
colours
They
d
no
right
observed
Uvar
Ivanovitch
and
he
drank
out
of
the
jug
To
be
sure
But
what
a
storm
of
criticism
gossip
and
comments
will
be
raised
in
Moscow
She
s
not
afraid
of
them
Besides
she
s
above
them
She
s
going
away
and
it
s
awful
to
think
where
she
s
going
to
such
a
distance
such
a
wilderness
What
future
awaits
her
there
I
seem
to
see
her
setting
off
from
a
posting
station
in
a
snow-storm
with
thirty
degrees
of
frost
She
s
leaving
her
country
and
her
people
but
I
understand
her
doing
it
Whom
is
she
leaving
here
behind
her
What
people
has
she
seen
Kurnatovsky
and
Bersenyev
and
our
humble
selves
and
these
are
the
best
she
s
seen
What
is
there
to
regret
about
it
One
thing
s
bad
I
m
told
her
husband
the
devil
how
that
word
sticks
in
my
throat
Insarov
I
m
told
is
spitting
blood
that
s
a
bad
lookout
I
saw
him
the
other
day
his
face
you
could
model
Brutus
from
it
straight
off
Do
you
know
who
Brutus
was
Uvar
Ivanovitch
What
is
there
to
know
a
man
to
be
sure
Precisely
so
he
was
a
man
Yes
he
s
a
wonderful
face
but
unhealthy
very
unhealthy
For
fighting
it
makes
no
difference
observed
Uvar
Ivanovitch
For
fighting
it
makes
no
difference
certainly
you
are
pleased
to
express
yourself
with
great
justice
to-day
but
for
living
it
makes
all
the
difference
And
you
see
she
wants
to
live
with
him
a
little
while
A
youthful
affair
responded
Uvar
Ivanovitch
Yes
a
youthful
glorious
bold
affair
Death
life
conflict
defeat
triumph
love
freedom
country
Good
God
grant
as
much
to
all
of
us
That
s
a
very
different
thing
from
sitting
up
to
one
s
neck
in
a
bog
and
pretending
it
s
all
the
same
to
you
when
in
fact
it
really
is
all
the
same
While
there
the
strings
are
tuned
to
the
highest
pitch
to
play
to
all
the
world
or
to
break
Shubin
s
head
sank
on
to
his
breast
Yes
he
resumed
after
a
prolonged
silence
Insarov
deserves
her
What
nonsense
though
No
one
deserves
her
Insarov
Insarov
What
s
the
use
of
pretended
modesty
We
ll
own
he
s
a
fine
fellow
he
stands
on
his
own
feet
though
up
to
the
present
he
has
done
no
more
than
we
poor
sinners
and
are
we
such
absolutely
worthless
dirt
Am
I
such
dirt
Uvar
Ivanovitch
Has
God
been
hard
on
me
in
every
way
Has
He
given
me
no
talents
no
abilities
Who
knows
perhaps
the
name
of
Pavel
Shubin
will
in
time
be
a
great
name
You
see
that
bronze
farthing
there
lying
on
your
table
Who
knows
some
day
perhaps
in
a
century
that
bronze
will
go
to
a
statue
of
Pavel
Shubin
raised
in
his
honour
by
a
grateful
posterity
Uvar
Ivanovitch
leaned
on
his
elbow
and
stared
at
the
enthusiastic
artist
That
s
a
long
way
off
he
said
at
last
with
his
usual
gesture
we
re
speaking
of
other
people
why
bring
in
yourself
O
great
philosopher
of
the
Russian
world
cried
Shubin
every
word
of
yours
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
and
it
s
not
to
me
but
to
you
a
statue
ought
to
be
raised
and
I
would
undertake
it
There
as
you
are
lying
now
in
that
pose
one
doesn
t
know
which
is
uppermost
in
it
sloth
or
strength
That
s
how
I
would
cast
you
in
bronze
You
aimed
a
just
reproach
at
my
egoism
and
vanity
Yes
yes
it
s
useless
talking
of
one
s-self
it
s
useless
bragging
We
have
no
one
yet
no
men
look
where
you
will
Everywhere
either
small
fry
nibblers
Hamlets
on
a
small
scale
self-absorbed
or
darkness
and
subterranean
chaos
or
idle
babblers
and
wooden
sticks
Or
else
they
are
like
this
they
study
themselves
to
the
most
shameful
detail
and
are
for
ever
feeling
the
pulse
of
every
sensation
and
reporting
to
themselves
That
s
what
I
feel
that
s
what
I
think
A
useful
rational
occupation
No
if
we
only
had
some
sensible
men
among
us
that
girl
that
delicate
soul
would
not
have
run
away
from
us
would
not
have
slipped
off
like
a
fish
to
the
water
What
s
the
meaning
of
it
Uvar
Ivanovitch
When
will
our
time
come
When
will
men
be
born
among
us
Give
us
time
answered
Uvar
Ivanovitch
they
will
be
They
will
be
soil
of
our
country
force
of
the
black
earth
thou
hast
said
they
will
be
Look
I
will
write
down
your
words
But
why
are
you
putting
out
the
candle
I
m
going
to
sleep
good-bye
Shubin
had
spoken
truly
The
unexpected
news
of
Elena
s
marriage
nearly
killed
Anna
Vassilyevna
She
took
to
her
bed
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
insisted
on
her
not
admitting
her
daughter
to
her
presence
he
seemed
to
be
enjoying
the
opportunity
of
showing
himself
in
the
fullest
sense
the
master
of
the
house
with
all
the
authority
of
the
head
of
the
family
he
made
an
incessant
uproar
in
the
household
storming
at
the
servants
and
constantly
saying
I
will
show
you
who
I
am
I
will
let
you
know
you
wait
a
little
While
he
was
in
the
house
Anna
Vassilyevna
did
not
see
Elena
and
had
to
be
content
with
Zoya
who
waited
on
her
very
devotedly
but
kept
thinking
to
herself
Diesen
Insarof
vorziehen
und
wem
But
directly
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
went
out
and
that
happened
pretty
often
Augustina
Christianovna
had
come
back
in
sober
earnest
Elena
went
to
her
mother
and
a
long
time
her
mother
gazed
at
her
in
silence
and
in
tears
This
dumb
reproach
more
deeply
than
any
other
cut
Elena
to
the
heart
at
such
moments
she
felt
not
remorse
but
a
deep
boundless
pity
akin
to
remorse
Mamma
dear
mamma
she
would
repeat
kissing
her
hands
what
was
I
to
do
I
m
not
to
blame
I
loved
him
I
could
not
have
acted
differently
Throw
the
blame
on
fate
for
throwing
me
with
a
man
whom
papa
doesn
t
like
and
who
is
taking
me
away
from
you
Ah
Anna
Vassilyevna
cut
her
short
don
t
remind
me
of
that
When
I
think
where
you
mean
to
go
my
heart
is
ready
to
burst
Dear
mamma
answered
Elena
be
comforted
at
least
it
might
have
been
worse
I
might
have
died
But
as
it
is
I
don
t
expect
to
see
you
again
Either
you
will
end
your
days
there
in
a
tent
somewhere
Anna
Vassilyevna
pictured
Bulgaria
as
something
after
the
nature
of
the
Siberian
swamps
or
I
shall
not
survive
the
separation
Don
t
say
that
mamma
dearest
we
shall
see
each
other
again
please
God
There
are
towns
in
Bulgaria
just
as
there
are
here
Fine
towns
there
indeed
There
is
war
going
on
there
now
wherever
you
go
I
suppose
they
are
firing
cannons
off
all
the
while
Are
you
meaning
to
set
off
soon
Soon
if
only
papa
He
means
to
appeal
to
the
authorities
he
threatens
to
separate
us
Anna
Vassilyevna
turned
her
eyes
heavenwards
No
Lenotchka
he
will
not
do
that
I
would
not
myself
have
consented
to
this
marriage
I
would
have
died
first
but
what
s
done
can
t
be
undone
and
I
will
not
let
my
daughter
be
disgraced
So
passed
a
few
days
At
last
Anna
Vassilyevna
plucked
up
her
courage
and
one
evening
she
shut
herself
up
alone
with
her
husband
in
her
room
The
whole
house
was
hushed
to
catch
every
sound
At
first
nothing
was
to
be
heard
then
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
s
voice
began
to
tune
up
then
a
quarrel
broke
out
shouts
were
raised
even
groans
were
discerned
Already
Shubin
was
plotting
with
the
maids
and
Zoya
to
rush
in
to
the
rescue
but
the
uproar
in
the
bedroom
began
by
degrees
to
grow
less
passed
into
quiet
talk
and
ceased
Only
from
time
to
time
a
faint
sob
was
to
be
heard
and
then
those
too
were
still
There
was
the
jingling
of
keys
the
creak
of
a
bureau
being
unfastened
The
door
was
opened
and
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
appeared
He
looked
surlily
at
every
one
who
met
him
and
went
out
to
the
club
while
Anna
Vassilyevna
sent
for
Elena
embraced
her
warmly
and
with
bitter
tears
flowing
down
her
cheeks
she
said
Everything
is
settled
he
will
not
make
a
scandal
and
there
is
nothing
now
to
hinder
you
from
going
from
abandoning
us
You
will
let
Dmitri
come
to
thank
you
Elena
begged
her
mother
as
soon
as
the
latter
had
been
restored
a
little
Wait
a
little
my
darling
I
can
not
bear
yet
to
see
the
man
who
has
come
between
us
We
shall
have
time
before
you
go
Before
we
go
repeated
Elena
mournfully
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
had
consented
not
to
make
a
scandal
but
Anna
Vassilyevna
did
not
tell
her
daughter
what
a
price
he
had
put
on
his
consent
She
did
not
tell
her
that
she
had
promised
to
pay
all
his
debts
and
had
given
him
a
thousand
roubles
down
on
the
spot
Moreover
he
had
declared
decisively
to
Anna
Vassilyevna
that
he
had
no
wish
to
meet
Insarov
whom
he
persisted
in
calling
the
Montenegrin
vagrant
and
when
he
got
to
the
club
he
began
quite
without
occasion
talking
of
Elena
s
marriage
to
his
partner
at
cards
a
retired
general
of
engineers
You
have
heard
he
observed
with
a
show
of
carelessness
my
daughter
through
the
higher
education
has
gone
and
married
a
student
The
general
looked
at
him
through
his
spectacles
muttered
H
m
and
asked
him
what
stakes
would
he
play
for
The
day
of
departure
drew
near
November
was
already
over
the
latest
date
for
starting
had
come
Insarov
had
long
ago
made
his
preparations
and
was
burning
with
anxiety
to
get
out
of
Moscow
as
soon
as
possible
And
the
doctor
was
urging
him
on
You
need
a
warm
climate
he
told
him
you
will
not
get
well
here
Elena
too
was
fretting
with
impatience
she
was
worried
by
Insarov
s
pallor
and
his
emaciation
She
often
looked
with
involuntary
terror
at
his
changed
face
Her
position
in
her
parents
house
had
become
insupportable
Her
mother
mourned
over
her
as
over
the
dead
while
her
father
treated
her
with
contemptuous
coldness
the
approaching
separation
secretly
pained
him
too
but
he
regarded
it
as
his
duty
the
duty
of
an
offended
father
to
disguise
his
feelings
his
weakness
Anna
Vassilyevna
at
last
expressed
a
wish
to
see
Insarov
He
was
taken
up
to
her
secretly
by
the
back
stairs
After
he
had
entered
her
room
for
a
long
time
she
could
not
speak
to
him
she
could
not
even
bring
herself
to
look
at
him
he
sat
down
near
her
chair
and
waited
with
quiet
respectfulness
for
her
first
word
Elena
sat
down
close
and
held
her
mother
s
hand
in
hers
At
last
Anna
Vassilyevna
raised
her
eyes
saying
God
is
your
judge
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
she
stopped
short
the
reproaches
died
away
on
her
lips
Why
you
are
ill
she
cried
Elena
your
husband
s
ill
I
have
been
unwell
Anna
Vassilyevna
answered
Insarov
and
even
now
I
am
not
quite
strong
yet
but
I
hope
my
native
air
will
make
me
perfectly
well
again
Ah
Bulgaria
murmured
Anna
Vassilyevna
and
she
thought
Good
God
a
Bulgarian
and
dying
a
voice
as
hollow
as
a
drum
and
eyes
like
saucers
a
perfect
skeleton
his
coat
hanging
loose
on
his
shoulders
his
face
as
yellow
as
a
guinea
and
she
s
his
wife
she
loves
him
it
must
be
a
bad
dream
But
she
checked
herself
at
once
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
she
said
are
you
absolutely
absolutely
bound
to
go
away
Absolutely
Anna
Vassilyevna
Anna
Vassilyevna
looked
at
him
Ah
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
God
grant
you
never
have
to
go
through
what
I
am
going
through
now
But
you
will
promise
me
to
take
care
of
her
to
love
her
You
will
not
have
to
face
poverty
while
I
am
living
Tears
choked
her
voice
She
opened
her
arms
and
Elena
and
Insarov
flung
themselves
into
her
embrace
The
fatal
day
had
come
at
last
It
had
been
arranged
that
Elena
should
say
good-bye
to
her
parents
at
home
and
should
start
on
the
journey
from
Insarov
s
lodgings
The
departure
was
fixed
for
twelve
o
clock
About
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
appointed
time
Bersenyev
arrived
He
had
expected
to
find
Insarov
s
compatriots
at
his
lodgings
anxious
to
see
him
off
but
they
had
already
gone
before
and
with
them
the
two
mysterious
persons
known
to
the
reader
they
had
been
witnesses
at
Insarov
s
wedding
The
tailor
met
the
kind
gentlemen
with
a
bow
he
presumably
to
drown
his
grief
but
possibly
to
celebrate
his
delight
at
getting
the
furniture
had
been
drinking
heavily
his
wife
soon
led
him
away
In
the
room
everything
was
by
this
time
ready
a
trunk
tied
up
with
cord
stood
on
the
floor
Bersenyev
sank
into
thought
many
memories
came
rushing
upon
him
Twelve
o
clock
had
long
ago
struck
and
the
driver
had
already
brought
round
the
horses
but
the
young
people
still
did
not
appear
At
last
hurrying
steps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
and
Elena
came
out
escorted
by
Insarov
and
Shubin
Elena
s
eyes
were
red
she
had
left
her
mother
lying
unconscious
the
parting
had
been
terrible
Elena
had
not
seen
Bersenyev
for
more
than
a
week
he
had
been
seldom
of
late
at
the
Stahovs
She
had
not
expected
to
meet
him
and
crying
You
thank
you
she
threw
herself
on
his
neck
Insarov
too
embraced
him
A
painful
silence
followed
What
could
these
three
say
to
one
another
what
were
they
feeling
in
their
hearts
Shubin
realised
the
necessity
of
cutting
short
everything
painful
with
light
words
Our
trio
has
come
together
again
he
began
for
the
last
time
Let
us
submit
to
the
decrees
of
fate
speak
of
the
past
with
kindness
and
in
God
s
name
go
forward
to
the
new
life
In
God
s
name
on
our
distant
way
he
began
to
hum
and
stopped
short
He
felt
suddenly
ashamed
and
awkward
It
is
a
sin
to
sing
where
the
dead
are
lying
and
at
that
instant
in
that
room
the
past
of
which
he
had
spoken
was
dying
the
past
of
the
people
met
together
in
it
It
was
dying
to
be
born
again
in
a
new
life
doubtless
still
it
was
death
Come
Elena
began
Insarov
turning
to
his
wife
I
think
everything
is
done
Everything
paid
and
everything
packed
There
s
nothing
more
except
to
take
the
box
down
He
called
his
landlord
The
tailor
came
into
the
room
together
with
his
wife
and
daughter
He
listened
slightly
reeling
to
Insarov
s
instructions
dragged
the
box
up
on
to
his
shoulders
and
ran
quickly
down
the
staircases
tramping
heavily
with
his
boots
Now
after
the
Russian
custom
we
must
sit
down
observed
Insarov
They
all
sat
down
Bersenyev
seated
himself
on
the
old
sofa
Elena
sat
next
him
the
landlady
and
her
daughter
squatted
in
the
doorway
All
were
silent
all
smiled
constrainedly
though
no
one
knew
why
he
was
smiling
each
of
them
wanted
to
say
something
at
parting
and
each
except
of
course
the
landlady
and
her
daughter
they
were
simply
rolling
their
eyes
felt
that
at
such
moments
it
is
only
permissible
to
utter
common-places
that
any
word
of
importance
of
sense
or
even
of
deep
feeling
would
be
somehow
out
of
place
almost
insincere
Insarov
was
the
first
to
get
up
and
he
began
crossing
himself
Farewell
our
little
room
he
cried
Then
came
kisses
the
sounding
but
cold
kisses
of
leave-taking
good
wishes
half
expressed
for
the
journey
promises
to
write
the
last
half-smothered
words
of
farewell
Elena
all
in
tears
had
already
taken
her
seat
in
the
sledge
Insarov
had
carefully
wrapped
her
feet
up
in
a
rug
Shubin
Bersenyev
the
landlord
his
wife
the
little
daughter
with
the
inevitable
kerchief
on
her
head
the
doorkeeper
a
workman
in
a
striped
bedgown
were
all
standing
on
the
steps
when
suddenly
a
splendid
sledge
harnessed
with
spirited
horses
flew
into
the
courtyard
and
from
the
sledge
shaking
the
snow
off
the
collar
of
his
cloak
leapt
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
I
am
not
too
late
thank
God
he
cried
running
up
to
their
sledge
Here
Elena
is
our
last
parental
benediction
he
said
bending
down
under
the
hood
and
taking
from
his
pocket
a
little
holy
image
sewn
in
a
velvet
bag
he
put
it
round
her
neck
She
began
to
sob
and
kiss
his
hands
and
the
coachman
meantime
pulled
out
of
the
forepart
of
the
sledge
a
half
bottle
of
champagne
and
three
glasses
Come
said
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
and
his
own
tears
were
trickling
on
to
the
beaver
collar
of
his
cloak
we
must
drink
to
good
journey
good
wishes
He
began
pouring
out
the
champagne
his
hands
were
shaking
the
foam
rose
over
the
edge
and
fell
on
to
the
snow
He
took
one
glass
and
gave
the
other
two
to
Elena
and
Insarov
who
by
now
was
seated
beside
hen
God
give
you
began
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
and
he
could
not
go
on
he
drank
off
the
wine
they
too
drank
off
their
glasses
Now
you
should
drink
gentlemen
he
added
turning
to
Shubin
and
Bersenyev
but
at
that
instant
the
driver
started
the
horses
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
ran
beside
the
sledge
Mind
and
write
to
us
he
said
in
a
broken
voice
Elena
put
out
her
head
saying
Good-bye
papa
Andrei
Petrovitch
Pavel
Yakovlitch
good-bye
all
good-bye
Russia
and
dropped
back
in
her
place
The
driver
flourished
his
whip
and
gave
a
whistle
the
sledge
its
runners
crunching
on
the
snow
turned
out
of
the
gates
to
the
right
and
disappeared
It
was
a
bright
April
day
On
the
broad
lagoon
which
separates
Venice
from
the
narrow
strip
of
accumulated
sea
sand
called
the
Lido
a
gondola
was
gliding
swaying
rhythmically
at
every
push
made
by
the
gondolier
as
he
leaned
on
the
big
pole
Under
its
low
awning
on
soft
leather
cushions
were
sitting
Elena
and
Insarov
Elena
s
features
had
not
changed
much
since
the
day
of
her
departure
from
Moscow
but
their
expression
was
different
it
was
more
thoughtful
and
more
severe
and
her
eyes
had
a
bolder
look
Her
whole
figure
had
grown
finer
and
more
mature
and
the
hair
seemed
to
lie
in
greater
thickness
and
luxuriance
along
her
white
brow
and
her
fresh
cheeks
Only
about
her
lips
when
she
was
not
smiling
a
scarcely
perceptible
line
showed
the
presence
of
a
hidden
constant
anxiety
In
Insarov
s
face
on
the
contrary
the
expression
had
remained
the
same
but
his
features
had
undergone
a
cruel
change
He
had
grown
thin
old
pale
and
bent
he
was
constantly
coughing
a
short
dry
cough
and
his
sunken
eyes
shone
with
a
strange
brilliance
On
the
way
from
Russia
Insarov
had
lain
ill
for
almost
two
months
at
Vienna
and
only
at
the
end
of
March
had
he
been
able
to
come
with
his
wife
to
Venice
from
there
he
was
hoping
to
make
his
way
through
Zara
to
Servia
to
Bulgaria
the
other
roads
were
closed
The
war
was
now
at
its
height
about
the
Danube
England
and
France
had
declared
war
on
Russia
all
the
Slavonic
countries
were
roused
and
were
preparing
for
an
uprising
The
gondola
put
in
to
the
inner
shore
of
the
Lido
Elena
and
Insarov
walked
along
the
narrow
sandy
road
planted
with
sickly
trees
every
year
they
plant
them
and
every
year
they
die
to
the
outer
shore
of
the
Lido
to
the
sea
They
walked
along
the
beach
The
Adriatic
rolled
its
muddy-blue
waves
before
them
they
raced
into
the
shore
foaming
and
hissing
and
drew
back
again
leaving
fine
shells
and
fragments
of
seaweed
on
the
beach
What
a
desolate
place
observed
Elena
I
m
afraid
it
s
too
cold
for
you
here
but
I
guess
why
you
wanted
to
come
here
Cold
rejoined
Insarov
with
a
rapid
and
bitter
smile
I
shall
be
a
fine
soldier
if
I
m
to
be
afraid
of
the
cold
I
came
here
I
will
tell
you
why
I
look
across
that
sea
and
I
feel
as
though
here
I
am
nearer
my
country
It
is
there
you
know
he
added
stretching
out
his
hand
to
the
East
the
wind
blows
from
there
Will
not
this
wind
bring
the
ship
you
are
expecting
said
Elena
See
there
is
a
white
sail
is
not
that
it
Insarov
gazed
seaward
into
the
distance
to
where
Elena
was
pointing
Renditch
promised
to
arrange
everything
for
us
within
a
week
he
said
we
can
rely
on
him
I
think
Did
you
hear
Elena
he
added
with
sudden
animation
they
say
the
poor
Dalmatian
fishermen
have
sacrificed
their
dredging
weights
you
know
the
leads
they
weigh
their
nets
with
for
letting
them
down
to
the
bottom
to
make
bullets
They
have
no
money
they
only
just
live
by
fishing
but
they
have
joyfully
given
up
their
last
property
and
now
are
starving
What
a
nation
Aufgepasst
shouted
a
haughty
voice
behind
them
The
heavy
thud
of
horse
s
hoofs
was
heard
and
an
Austrian
officer
in
a
short
grey
tunic
and
a
green
cap
galloped
past
them
they
had
scarcely
time
to
get
out
of
the
way
Insarov
looked
darkly
after
him
He
was
not
to
blame
said
Elena
you
know
they
have
no
other
place
where
they
can
ride
He
was
not
to
blame
answered
Insarov
but
he
made
my
blood
boil
with
his
shout
his
moustaches
his
cap
his
whole
appearance
Let
us
go
back
Yes
let
us
go
back
Dmitri
It
s
really
cold
here
You
did
not
take
care
of
yourself
after
your
Moscow
illness
and
you
had
to
pay
for
that
at
Vienna
Now
you
must
be
more
cautious
Insarov
did
not
answer
but
the
same
bitter
smile
passed
over
his
lips
If
you
like
Elena
went
on
we
will
go
along
to
the
Canal
Grande
We
have
not
seen
Venice
properly
you
know
all
the
while
we
have
been
here
And
in
the
evening
we
are
going
to
the
theatre
I
have
two
tickets
for
the
stalls
They
say
there
s
a
new
opera
being
given
If
you
like
we
will
give
up
to-day
to
one
another
we
will
forget
politics
and
war
and
everything
we
will
forget
everything
but
that
we
are
alive
breathing
thinking
together
that
we
are
one
for
ever
would
you
like
that
If
you
would
like
it
Elena
answered
Insarov
it
follows
that
I
should
like
it
too
I
knew
that
observed
Elena
with
a
smile
come
let
us
go
They
went
back
to
the
gondola
took
their
seats
told
the
gondolier
to
take
them
without
hurry
along
the
Canal
Grande
No
one
who
has
not
seen
Venice
in
April
knows
all
the
unutterable
fascinations
of
that
magic
town
The
softness
and
mildness
of
spring
harmonise
with
Venice
just
as
the
glaring
sun
of
summer
suits
the
magnificence
of
Genoa
and
as
the
gold
and
purple
of
autumn
suits
the
grand
antiquity
of
Rome
The
beauty
of
Venice
like
the
spring
touches
the
soul
and
moves
it
to
desire
it
frets
and
tortures
the
inexperienced
heart
like
the
promise
of
a
coming
bliss
mysterious
but
not
elusive
Everything
in
it
is
bright
and
everything
is
wrapt
in
a
drowsy
tangible
mist
as
it
were
of
the
hush
of
love
everything
in
it
is
so
silent
and
everything
in
it
is
kindly
everything
in
it
is
feminine
from
its
name
upwards
It
has
well
been
given
the
name
of
the
fair
city
Its
masses
of
palaces
and
churches
stand
out
light
and
wonderful
like
the
graceful
dream
of
a
young
god
there
is
something
magical
something
strange
and
bewitching
in
the
greenish-grey
light
and
silken
shimmer
of
the
silent
water
of
the
canals
in
the
noiseless
gliding
of
the
gondolas
in
the
absence
of
the
coarse
din
of
a
town
the
coarse
rattling
and
crashing
and
uproar
Venice
is
dead
Venice
is
deserted
her
citizens
will
tell
you
but
perhaps
this
last
charm
the
charm
of
decay
was
not
vouchsafed
her
in
the
very
heyday
of
the
flower
and
majesty
of
her
beauty
He
who
has
not
seen
her
knows
her
not
neither
Canaletto
nor
Guardi
to
say
nothing
of
later
painters
has
been
able
to
convey
the
silvery
tenderness
of
the
atmosphere
the
horizon
so
close
yet
so
elusive
the
divine
harmony
of
exquisite
lines
and
melting
colours
One
who
has
outlived
his
life
who
has
been
crushed
by
it
should
not
visit
Venice
she
will
be
cruel
to
him
as
the
memory
of
unfulfilled
dreams
of
early
days
but
sweet
to
one
whose
strength
is
at
its
full
who
is
conscious
of
happiness
let
him
bring
his
bliss
under
her
enchanted
skies
and
however
bright
it
may
be
Venice
will
make
it
more
golden
with
her
unfading
splendour
The
gondola
in
which
Insarov
and
Elena
were
sitting
passed
Riva
dei
Schiavoni
the
palace
of
the
Doges
and
Piazzetta
and
entered
the
Grand
Canal
On
both
sides
stretched
marble
palaces
they
seemed
to
float
softly
by
scarcely
letting
the
eye
seize
or
absorb
their
beauty
Elena
felt
herself
deeply
happy
in
the
perfect
blue
of
her
heavens
there
was
only
one
dark
cloud
and
it
was
in
the
far
distance
Insarov
was
much
better
that
day
They
glided
as
far
as
the
acute
angle
of
the
Rialto
and
turned
back
Elena
was
afraid
of
the
chill
of
the
churches
for
Insarov
but
she
remembered
the
academy
delle
Belle
Arti
and
told
the
gondolier
to
go
towards
it
They
quickly
walked
through
all
the
rooms
of
that
little
museum
Being
neither
connoisseurs
nor
dilettantes
they
did
not
stop
before
every
picture
they
put
no
constraint
on
themselves
a
spirit
of
light-hearted
gaiety
came
over
them
Everything
seemed
suddenly
very
entertaining
Children
know
this
feeling
very
well
To
the
great
scandal
of
three
English
visitors
Elena
laughed
till
she
cried
over
the
St
Mark
of
Tintoretto
skipping
down
from
the
sky
like
a
frog
into
the
water
to
deliver
the
tortured
slave
Insarov
in
his
turn
fell
into
raptures
over
the
back
and
legs
of
the
sturdy
man
in
the
green
cloak
who
stands
in
the
foreground
of
Titian
s
Ascension
and
holds
his
arms
outstretched
after
the
Madonna
but
the
Madonna
a
splendid
powerful
woman
calmly
and
majestically
making
her
way
towards
the
bosom
of
God
the
Father
impressed
both
Insarov
and
Elena
they
liked
too
the
austere
and
reverent
painting
of
the
elder
Cima
da
Conegliano
As
they
were
leaving
the
academy
they
took
another
look
at
the
Englishmen
behind
them
with
their
long
rabbit-like
teeth
and
drooping
whiskers
and
laughed
they
glanced
at
their
gondolier
with
his
abbreviated
jacket
and
short
breeches
and
laughed
they
caught
sight
of
a
woman
selling
old
clothes
with
a
knob
of
grey
hair
on
the
very
top
of
her
head
and
laughed
more
than
ever
they
looked
into
one
another
s
face
and
went
off
into
peals
of
laughter
and
directly
they
had
sat
down
in
the
gondola
they
clasped
each
other
s
hand
in
a
close
close
grip
They
reached
their
hotel
ran
into
their
room
and
ordered
dinner
to
be
brought
in
Their
gaiety
did
not
desert
them
at
dinner
They
pressed
each
other
to
eat
drank
to
the
health
of
their
friends
in
Moscow
clapped
their
hands
at
the
waiter
for
a
delicious
dish
of
fish
and
kept
asking
him
for
live
frutti
di
mare
the
waiter
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
scraped
with
his
feet
but
when
he
had
left
them
he
shook
his
head
and
once
even
muttered
with
a
sigh
poveretti
poor
things
After
dinner
they
set
off
for
the
theatre
They
were
giving
an
opera
of
Verdi
s
which
though
honestly
speaking
rather
vulgar
has
already
succeeded
in
making
the
round
of
all
the
European
theatres
an
opera
well-known
among
Russians
La
Traviata
The
season
in
Venice
was
over
and
none
of
the
singers
rose
above
the
level
of
mediocrity
every
one
shouted
to
the
best
of
their
abilities
The
part
of
Violetta
was
performed
by
an
artist
of
no
renown
and
judging
by
the
cool
reception
given
her
by
the
public
not
a
favourite
but
she
was
not
destitute
of
talent
She
was
a
young
and
not
very
pretty
black-eyed
girl
with
an
unequal
and
already
overstrained
voice
Her
dress
was
ill-chosen
and
naively
gaudy
her
hair
was
hidden
in
a
red
net
her
dress
of
faded
blue
satin
was
too
tight
for
her
and
thick
Swedish
gloves
reached
up
to
her
sharp
elbows
Indeed
how
could
she
the
daughter
of
some
Bergamese
shepherd
know
how
Parisian
dames
aux
camelias
dress
And
she
did
not
understand
how
to
move
on
the
stage
but
there
was
much
truth
and
artless
simplicity
in
her
acting
and
she
sang
with
that
passion
of
expression
and
rhythm
which
is
only
vouchsafed
to
Italians
Elena
and
