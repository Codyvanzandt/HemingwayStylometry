poetry
No
she
thinks
it
is
all
made
up
all
false
that
is
just
what
she
does
n't
like
What
a
strange
fault
to
find
exclaimed
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Made
up
What
else
could
it
be
That
's
just
what
creative
artists
are
for
Well
there
it
is
but
you
ought
n't
to
like
poetry
either
On
the
contrary
I
am
very
fond
of
good
poetry
when
it
is
really
good
and
musical
and
what
shall
I
say
when
it
presents
ideas
thoughts
Marya
Pavlovna
got
up
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
turned
quickly
to
her
Where
are
you
going
Masha
To
put
the
children
to
bed
It
is
nearly
nine
o'clock
But
ca
n't
they
go
to
bed
without
you
But
Marya
Pavlovna
took
the
children
by
their
hands
and
went
out
with
them
She
is
in
a
bad
mood
to-day
observed
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
and
I
know
why
she
added
in
an
undertone
but
it
will
pass
Allow
me
to
ask
you
began
Vladimir
Sergeitch
where
do
you
intend
to
spend
the
winter
Possibly
here
possibly
in
Petersburg
I
feel
as
though
I
should
be
bored
in
Petersburg
The
two
friends
and
other
stories
Bored
in
Petersburg
You
surprise
me
How
is
that
possible
And
Vladimir
Sergeitch
fell
to
describing
all
the
conveniences
charms
and
advantages
of
life
in
the
capital
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
lis
tened
attentively
without
taking
her
eyes
off
him
She
seemed
to
be
studying
his
features
and
from
time
to
time
smiled
to
herself
I
see
you
are
very
eloquent
she
said
at
last
I
shall
have
to
spend
the
winter
in
Petersburg
You
will
not
regret
it
declared
Vladimir
Sergeitch
I
never
regret
anything
it
is
not
worth
the
trouble
If
you
do
an
i
hing
silly
try
and
forget
it
as
soon
as
possible
that
's
all
Allow
me
to
ask
Vladimir
Sergeitch
asked
in
French
after
a
brief
silence
have
you
known
Marya
Pavlovna
long
Allow
me
to
ask
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
retorted
with
swift
mockery
why
did
you
ask
just
that
question
in
French
Oh
for
no
particular
reason
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
smiled
again
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
No
I
have
not
known
her
very
long
She
is
a
remarkable
girl
is
n't
she
She
is
very
original
Vladimir
Sergeitch
assented
through
his
teeth
Well
from
you
from
a
practical
person
is
that
praise
I
do
n't
think
so
perhaps
I
strike
you
as
original
too
But
the
moon
must
have
risen
she
added
getting
up
from
her
seat
and
glancing
at
the
open
window
that
's
moonlight
on
the
tops
of
the
poplars
It
's
time
to
go
I
'll
go
and
tell
them
to
saddle
Beauty
He
is
saddled
said
her
page
stepping
out
of
the
shade
of
the
park
into
the
streak
of
light
that
fell
on
the
verandah
Oh
that
's
right
Masha
where
are
you
Come
and
say
good-bye
Marya
Pavlovna
came
in
from
the
adjoin
ing
room
The
men
got
up
from
the
card
table
Are
you
going
already
asked
Ipatov
Yes
it
's
time
She
went
towards
the
verandah
door
What
a
night
she
exclaimed
Come
nearer
put
your
face
out
do
you
feel
it
It
seems
to
be
breathing
And
what
a
scent
All
the
flowers
are
awake
now
They
wake
up
while
we
are
thinking
of
going
to
sleep
And
by
the
way
Masha
she
added
I
have
been
telling
Vladimir
Sergeitch
that
you
don't
like
poetry
And
now
good-bye
Here
they
are
bringing
my
horse
And
she
ran
rapidly
down
the
verandah
steps
leapt
lightly
into
the
saddle
said
Good
bye
till
to-morrow
and
switching
the
horse
on
the
neck
galloped
to
the
dam
the
page
trotted
behind
her
Everyone
looked
after
her
Till
to-morrow
they
heard
her
voice
be
yond
the
poplars
The
thud
of
hoof
was
au
dible
for
a
long
time
in
the
stillness
of
the
sum
mer
night
At
last
Ipatov
suggested
they
should
go
back
into
the
house
It
certainly
is
nice
in
the
open
air
he
said
but
we
must
finish
our
game
All
the
company
returned
to
the
house
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
asking
Marya
Pav
lovna
why
she
did
not
like
poetry
I
do
n't
care
for
it
she
answered
with
seem
ing
reluctance
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
But
perhaps
you
have
not
read
much
poetry
I
have
not
read
it
myself
but
it
has
been
read
to
me
And
v^^as
n't
there
a
single
poem
you
liked
No
not
one
Even
Pushkin
Even
Pushkin
Why
Marya
Pavlovna
made
no
answer
and
Ipatov
turning
round
said
over
the
back
of
his
chair
with
a
good-natured
laugh
that
she
did
not
only
dislike
poetry
but
even
sugar
and
in
fact
could
not
bear
sweet
things
at
all
But
there
are
poems
that
are
not
sweet
Vladimir
Sergeitch
retorted
For
instance
asked
Marya
Pavlovna
Vladimir
Sergeitch
scratched
his
head
He
knew
very
little
poetry
by
heart
himself
particularly
of
the
kind
that
was
not
sweet
Well
he
cried
at
last
do
you
know
Push
kin
's
'The
Upas
Tree
No
That
poem
can
not
possibly
be
called
sweet
Repeat
it
IMarya
Pavlovna
asked
him
and
she
dropped
her
eyes
Vladimir
Sergeitch
looked
at
the
ceiling
frowned
muttered
to
himself
and
at
last
re
peated
The
Upas
Tree
After
the
first
four
verses
Marya
Pavlovna
slowly
raised
her
eyes
and
when
Vladimir
Sergeitch
finished
she
said
as
slowly
Please
repeat
it
over
again
You
like
the
poem
then
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Repeat
it
again
Vladimir
Sergeitch
recited
'The
Upas
Tree
again
Marya
Pavlovna
got
up
went
into
an
other
room
and
came
back
with
a
sheet
of
paper
an
inkstand
and
a
pen
Please
write
it
out
for
me
she
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Certainly
with
pleasure
he
answered
be
ginning
to
write
But
I
confess
I
wonder
why
you
like
this
poem
so
much
I
repeated
it
just
to
show
you
that
not
all
poetry
is
sweet
Well
I
declare
exclaimed
Ipatov
what
do
you
think
of
those
verses
Ivan
Ilyitch
Ivan
Ilyitch
as
usual
simply
glanced
at
Ipa
tov
but
did
not
utter
a
word
Here
it
is
finished
said
Vladimir
Serge
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
itch
putting
a
note
of
exclamation
at
the
end
of
the
last
line
Marya
Pavlovna
thanked
him
and
carried
off
the
copy
of
the
poem
to
her
own
room
Half
an
hour
later
supper
was
served
and
within
an
hour
all
the
guests
separated
to
their
rooms
Vladimir
Sergeitch
more
than
once
ad
dressed
Marya
Pavlovna
but
it
was
difficult
to
keep
up
a
conversation
with
her
and
the
things
he
said
did
not
seem
to
interest
her
much
He
would
probably
have
gone
off
to
sleep
at
once
on
getting
into
bed
if
he
had
not
been
kept
awake
by
his
neighbour
Yegor
Kapiton
itch
The
husband
of
Matryona
Markovna
after
undressing
and
getting
into
bed
carried
on
a
long
conversation
with
his
servant
whom
he
kept
admonishing
Every
word
he
uttered
reached
Vladimir
Sergeitch
distinctly
the
rooms
were
only
divided
by
a
thin
partition
wall
Hold
the
candle
straight
in
front
of
you
said
Yegor
Kapitonitch
in
a
complaining
voice
hold
it
so
that
I
can
see
your
face
You
have
turned
my
hair
grey
you
unprincipled
fellow
you
've
turned
my
hair
grey
But
how
have
I
turned
your
hair
grey
Yegor
Kapitonitch
the
indistinct
and
sleepy
voice
of
the
servant
was
heard
How
I
'll
tell
you
how
How
many
times
have
I
said
to
you
'Mitka
I
have
said
to
you
'whenever
you
go
away
with
me
anywhere
on
a
visit
always
pack
two
changes
of
clothes
particularly
hold
the
candle
straight
in
front
of
you
particularly
of
under
clothes
And
what
have
you
done
to
me
to-day
Why
what
sir
You
ask
what
What
am
I
to
put
on
to
morrow
morning
Why
the
same
as
you
had
on
to-day
You
've
turned
my
hair
grey
you
ruffian
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
myself
I
was
so
hot
to-day
Hold
the
candle
straight
in
front
of
you
I
tell
you
and
do
n't
go
to
sleep
when
your
master
is
talking
to
you
And
Matryona
Markovna
told
me
it
was
enough
'Why
always
take
such
a
lot
of
things
with
you
she
said
'They
only
get
worn
out
for
nothing
Matryona
Markovna
As
though
it
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
were
a
woman
's
business
to
go
into
that
You
've
turned
my
hair
grey
you
have
And
Yahim
said
so
too
What
did
you
say
I
say
Yahim
said
so
too
Yahim
Yahim
Yegor
Kapitonitch
re
peated
reproachfully
You
'll
be
the
death
of
me
you
heathens
They
ca
n't
speak
Russian
properly
Yahim
Why
does
Yahim
mean
Yefim
well
at
a
pinch
one
can
say
that
for
the
real
Greek
name
is
Yevfimy
do
you
under
stand
me
Hold
the
candle
straight
be
fore
you
But
for
shortness
one
may
say
Yefim
but
certainly
not
Yahim
Yahim
re
peated
Yegor
Kapitonitch
with
an
emphasis
on
the
ya
You
've
turned
my
hair
grey
you
vil
lains
Hold
the
candle
straight
before
you
And
Yegor
Kapitonitch
went
on
for
a
long
time
lecturing
his
servant
in
spite
of
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
sighs
coughs
and
other
signs
of
impatience
At
last
he
dismissed
his
Mitka
and
went
to
sleep
but
this
did
not
improve
matters
for
Vlad
imir
Sergeitch
Yegor
Kapitonitch
had
such
a
deep
and
powerful
snore
with
such
playful
transitions
from
the
highest
treble
to
the
deep
est
bass
with
such
whistling
and
even
clicking
sounds
that
the
very
partition
wall
seemed
to
be
quivering
in
response
to
it
Poor
Vladimir
Sergeitch
felt
ready
to
cry
It
was
very
stuffy
in
his
room
and
the
feather
bed
on
which
he
lay
seemed
to
wrap
his
whole
person
in
a
sort
of
creeping
heat
In
despair
Vladimir
Sergeitch
got
up
at
last
opened
his
window
and
greedily
drank
in
the
fragrant
freshness
of
the
night
The
window
looked
into
the
park
the
sky
was
light
the
round
face
of
the
full
moon
was
at
one
moment
reflected
clearly
in
the
pond
at
the
next
was
drawn
out
into
a
long
golden
sheaf
of
slowly
shifting
sparkles
In
one
of
the
garden
paths
Vladimir
Sergeitch
saw
a
figure
dressed
like
a
woman
it
was
Marya
Pavlovna
in
the
moon
light
her
face
looked
pale
She
stood
motion
less
and
suddenly
began
speaking
Vlad
imir
Sergeitch
cautiously
put
out
his
head
Yet
thither
with
imperious
glance
A
man
his
fellow-man
has
sent
reached
his
hearing
A
OUIET
6ACICWATER
Imagine
that
he
thought
so
the
verses
have
had
an
effect
on
her
And
he
listened
with
redoubled
attention
But
Marya
Pavlovna
soon
ceased
speaking
and
turned
more
directly
facing
him
he
could
dis
tinguish
her
large
dark
eyes
her
severe
brow
and
lips
Suddenly
she
started
turned
round
passed
into
the
shadow
cast
by
a
dense
wall
of
tall
acacias
and
disappeared
Vladimir
Sergeitch
remained
standing
a
considerable
time
at
the
window
then
at
last
he
got
into
bed
but
did
not
soon
fall
asleep
A
strange
creature
he
thought
as
he
turned
from
side
to
side
and
they
say
there
is
noth
ing
special
to
be
found
in
the
country
Yes
indeed
A
strange
creature
I
'll
ask
her
to-morrow
what
she
was
doing
in
the
garden
Yegor
Kapitonitch
was
still
snoring
as
be
fore

CHAPTER
III
Next
morning
Vladimir
Sergeitch
woke
rather
late
and
immediately
after
breakfast
in
the
dining-room
went
home
to
make
final
arrange
ments
on
his
estate
in
spite
of
old
Ipatov's
efforts
to
keep
him
Marya
Pavlovna
was
present
at
breakfast
Vladimir
Sergeitch
did
not
think
it
necessary
however
to
question
her
about
her
walk
in
the
garden
in
the
night
he
belonged
to
that
class
of
people
to
whom
it
is
difficult
to
give
themselves
up
for
two
days
together
to
unaccustomed
thoughts
and
con
jectures
He
would
have
had
to
talk
about
the
poem
and
the
poetical
mood
as
it
is
called
soon
wearied
him
He
spent
the
whole
day
in
the
fields
till
dinner
for
which
he
had
a
keen
appetite
had
a
nap
and
on
waking
up
was
about
to
look
through
the
rural
clerk
's
account
but
before
he
had
finished
the
first
page
or
dered
his
carriage
and
set
off
to
Ipatovka
Evi
y
i
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
dently
even
practical
people
have
not
hearts
of
stone
and
are
no
fonder
of
being
dull
than
ordi
nary
mortals
As
he
drove
on
to
the
dam
he
heard
voices
and
the
sound
of
music
At
Ipatov
's
house
they
were
singing
Russian
songs
in
chorus
He
found
on
the
verandah
the
whole
company
he
had
left
in
the
morning
they
all
among
them
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
were
sitting
in
a
semi
circle
round
a
man
of
about
thirty-two
with
a
dark
complexion
black
hair
and
black
eyes
wearing
a
short
velvet
coat
and
a
red
cravat
tied
loosely
round
his
neck
and
holding
a
guitar
in
his
hands
This
was
Pyotr
Alexeitch
Veret
yev
the
brother
of
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
On
seeing
Vladimir
Sergeitch
old
Ipatov
went
to
meet
him
with
an
exclamation
of
delight
led
him
up
to
Veretyev
and
introduced
them
After
exchanging
the
usual
greetings
with
his
new
acquaintance
Astahov
bowed
respect
fully
to
the
latter
's
sister
We
are
singing
songs
in
the
village
style
began
Ipatov
and
indicating
Veretyev
he
added
Pyotr
Alexeitch
is
our
conductor
and
such
a
conductor
you
will
hear
V7
The
two
friends
and
otHfiR
stories
It
is
very
delightful
answered
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Wo
n't
you
join
the
chorus
asked
Nad
yezhda
Alexyevna
I
should
be
delighted
but
I
have
no
voice
That
does
not
matter
Look
Yegor
Kapi
tonitch
is
singing
and
I
am
singing
You
need
only
join
in
Sit
down
begin
brother
What
song
shall
we
sing
now
said
Veret
yev
strumming
on
the
guitar
and
stopping
suddenly
he
looked
at
Marya
Pavlovna
who
was
sitting
beside
him
I
think
it
is
your
turn
now
he
said
to
her
No
you
sing
answered
INIarya
Pavlovna
There
is
a
song
'Down
Mother
Volga
Vladimir
Sergeitch
observed
with
dignity
No
we
are
saving
that
for
the
end
an
swered
Veretyev
and
striking
the
strings
he
began
singing
dwelling
on
each
note
The
Sun
Is
Setting
He
sang
capitally
with
spirit
and
gaiety
His
manly
face
which
was
expressive
at
all
times
became
even
livelier
when
he
was
singing
now
and
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
suddenly
pressed
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
on
the
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
strings
raised
his
hand
shook
his
cuds
and
looked
round
him
with
a
keen
proud
air
In
Moscow
he
had
more
than
once
seen
the
famous
gipsy
Ilya
and
was
imitating
him
The
chorus
seconded
him
vigorously
Marya
Pavlovna's
mellow
voice
stood
out
above
all
the
others
it
seemed
to
lead
the
others
but
she
would
not
sing
alone
and
Veretyev
remained
the
con
ductor
to
the
end
They
sang
many
other
songs
Meanwhile
a
storm
was
coming
on
with
the
approach
of
evening
It
had
been
stiflingly
hot
since
mid-day
and
there
had
been
rumblings
in
the
distance
but
now
a
broad
storm-cloud
which
had
long
lain
like
a
leaden
shroud
on
the
very
rim
of
the
horizon
began
to
grow
and
appear
above
the
tree-tops
the
sultry
air
began
quivering
more
perceptibly
more
and
more
vio
lently
troubled
by
the
approaching
storm
a
wind
sprang
up
rustled
abruptly
among
the
leaves
sank
into
silence
again
set
up
a
pro
longed
rustling
and
howled
among
the
trees
a
gloomy
darkness
moved
rapidly
over
the
land
driving
before
it
the
last
glow
of
sunset
dense
clouds
as
though
suddenly
released
floated
upwards
and
flew
across
the
sky
there
came
a
spatter
of
rain
a
red
flash
of
lightning
and
a
heavy
angry
roll
of
thunder
Let
us
go
in
said
old
Ipatov
or
we
may
get
wet
Everyone
got
up
In
a
minute
cried
Veretyev
Let
us
have
the
last
song
Listen
'Oh
my
porch
oh
my
new
porch
He
sang
in
a
loud
voice
rapidly
striking
the
chords
with
the
whole
of
his
hand
My
porch
of
maple
The
chorus
took
it
up
as
though
carried
away
by
the
tune
Almost
at
the
same
instant
the
rain
came
lashing
down
in
streams
but
Veretyev
sang
My
porch
to
the
end
Drowned
from
time
to
time
by
peals
of
thunder
the
gay
reckless
song
sounded
even
gayer
and
more
reckless
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
noisy
patter
and
gurgling
of
the
rain
Finally
the
last
outburst
of
the
chorus
rang
out
and
the
whole
company
ran
laughing
into
the
draw
ing-room
The
little
girls
Ipatov
's
daughters
laughed
more
loudly
than
anyone
as
they
shook
the
raindrops
off
their
dresses
Ipatov
how
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
ever
by
way
of
precaution
dosed
the
window
and
the
door
and
Yegor
Kapitonitch
com
mended
his
prudence
observing
that
Matryona
Markovna
too
insisted
on
all
windows
and
doors
being
shut
during
a
storm
since
electricity
acts
more
freely
in
an
empty
space
Bodryakov
looked
into
his
face
moved
away
and
upset
a
chair
Such
little
mishaps
were
very
frequent
with
him
The
storm
was
very
quickly
over
The
doors
and
windows
were
opened
again
and
the
rooms
were
filled
with
moist
fragrance
Tea
was
brought
in
After
tea
the
old
gentlemen
sat
down
to
cards
again
Ivan
Ilyitch
as
usual
seated
himself
beside
them
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
up
to
Marya
Pavlovna
who
was
sitting
in
the
window
with
Veretyev
but
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
summoned
him
and
immediately
en
tered
into
a
lively
conversation
with
him
about
Petersburg
and
Petersburg
life
She
attacked
it
Vladimir
Sergeitch
began
defending
it
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
seemed
anxious
to
keep
him
at
her
side
What
are
you
arguing
about
said
Veret
yev
getting
up
and
coming
towards
them
He
walked
with
a
lazy
swing
in
all
his
move
ments
there
was
something
between
noncha
lance
and
indolence
About
Petersburg
answered
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
Vladimir
Sergeitch
can
not
say
enough
in
its
praise
It
's
a
nice
town
observed
Veretyev
but
I
think
it
's
nice
everywhere
Yes
really
Where
there
are
two
or
three
women
and
ex
cuse
my
frankness
wine
man
really
has
noth
ing
left
to
desire
That
surprises
me
answered
Vladimir
Sergeitch
can
you
really
be
of
the
opinion
that
for
fin
educated
man
there
exists
nothing
Perhaps
just
so
I
agree
with
you
interrupted
Veretyev
who
with
all
his
politeness
had
the
habit
of
not
letting
other
people
finish
their
sentences
But
that
's
not
in
my
line
I
am
not
a
philosopher
I
am
not
a
philosopher
either
said
Vladi
mir
Sergeitch
and
have
no
desire
to
be
one
but
we
are
talking
of
something
quite
dif
ferent
Veretyev
looked
at
his
sister
with
a
non
A
OUlET
BACKWATER
chalant
air
and
with
a
faint
smile
she
bent
down
to
him
and
half-whispered
Petrusha
darling
act
Yegor
Kapitonitch
for
us
do
Veretyev
's
face
instantly
changed
and
God
knows
by
what
miracle
in
a
flash
be
came
extraordinarily
like
that
of
Yegor
Kapi
tonitch
though
there
was
nothing
in
common
in
the
features
of
the
one
and
the
other
and
all
that
Veretyev
did
was
to
wrinkle
up
his
nose
and
drop
the
corners
of
his
mouth
Of
course
he
began
whispering
in
a
voice
exactly
like
Yegor
Kapitonitch
's
Matryona
Markovna
is
a
lady
very
strict
on
the
point
of
manners
but
she
is
an
exemplary
wife
It
is
true
that
whatever
I
say
The
Biryulovsky
young
ladies
know
all
about
it
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
put
in
hardly
able
to
restrain
her
laughter
They
know
all
about
it
next
day
answered
Veretyev
with
such
a
killing
grimace
such
an
embarrassed
side
glance
that
even
Vladimir
Sergeitch
laughed
You
have
a
great
talent
for
mimicry
I
see
he
observed
Veretyev
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
his
features
resumed
their
ordinary
expression
and
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
cried
Oh
yes
he
can
mimic
anyone
he
likes
He
has
a
genius
for
it
And
could
you
mimic
me
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
To
be
sure
he
can
said
Nadyezhda
Alex
yevna
I
should
think
so
Oh
please
do
mimic
me
said
Astahov
ad
dressing
Veretyev
I
beg
you
not
to
stand
on
ceremony
Did
you
really
beHeve
her
answered
Veret
yev
slightly
screwing
up
one
eye
and
giving
his
voice
Astahov
's
intonation
but
so
slightly
and
discreetly
that
only
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
noticed
it
and
bit
her
lip
You
must
n't
believe
her
please
she
may
tell
you
all
sorts
of
stories
about
me
And
if
only
you
knew
what
an
actor
he
is
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
went
on
he
can
act
any
character
It
's
so
wonderful
He
is
our
stage
manager
and
prompter
and
everything
It
is
a
pity
you
are
going
away
so
soon
Sister
your
partiality
blinds
you
Veretyev
observed
in
a
dignified
voice
but
still
with
the
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
same
intonation
What
will
Mr
Astahov
think
of
you
He
will
think
you
are
a
pro
vincial
young
lady
Oh
I
assure
you
Vladimir
Serge
itch
was
beginning
Petrusha
I
tell
you
what
put
in
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
you
show
us
how
a
drunken
man
can
not
get
a
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
or
better
act
a
boy
trying
to
catch
a
fly
on
the
win
dow
while
it
buzzes
under
his
fingers
You
are
a
regular
child
answered
Veretyev
He
got
up
however
and
going
to
the
window
by
which
Marya
Pavlovna
was
sitting
began
passing
his
hand
over
the
pane
and
acting
a
boy
catching
a
fly
The
accuracy
with
which
he
imitated
the
pitiful
buzz
of
the
insect
was
really
amazing
It
seemed
as
though
a
real
fly
were
under
his
fingers
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
laughed
and
gradually
everyone
in
the
room
began
laughing
Marya
Pavlovna
's
face
did
not
change
however
there
was
not
even
a
quiver
on
her
lips
She
sat
with
downcast
eyes
at
last
she
raised
them
and
looking
with
a
grave
face
at
Veretyev
she
brought
out
through
her
teeth
It
's
a
strange
taste
to
want
to
make
a
fool
of
yourself
Veretyev
turned
away
from
the
window
at
once
and
after
standing
for
a
little
while
in
the
middle
of
the
room
went
out
on
to
the
verandah
and
from
it
into
the
park
which
was
by
now
wrapped
in
darkness
He
is
an
amusing
fellow
that
Pyotr
Alexe
itch
observed
Yegor
Kapitonitch
flinging
down
a
seven
of
trumps
on
his
opponent
's
ace
He
really
is
an
amusing
fellow
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
got
up
and
going
hur
riedly
to
Marya
Pavlovna
asked
her
in
an
undertone
What
did
you
say
to
my
brother
Nothing
she
answered
What
do
you
mean
by
'nothing
It
can't
have
been
nothing
And
after
a
brief
pause
Nadyezhda
Alex
yevna
brought
out
come
along
took
Marya
Pavlovna
by
the
hand
made
her
get
up
and
go
with
her
into
the
garden
Vladimir
Sergeitch
looked
after
the
two
young
ladies
with
some
surprise
But
their
absence
did
not
last
long
they
came
back
within
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
Pyotr
Alexeitch
came
in
with
them
Such
a
lovely
night
cried
Nadyezhda
Alex
yevna
as
she
walked
in
How
nice
it
is
in
the
garden
Oh
yes
by
the
way
said
Vladimir
Serge
itch
was
it
you
I
saw
in
the
garden
last
night
Marya
Pavlovna
Marya
Pavlovna
glanced
rapidly
into
his
eyes
You
were
reciting
Pushkin
's
'Upas
Tree
if
I
am
not
mistaken
Veretyev
gave
a
slight
frown
and
also
began
looking
at
Astahov
Yes
it
was
me
said
Marya
Pavlovna
but
I
was
not
reciting
anything
I
never
recite
Perhaps
it
was
my
fancy
began
Vladimir
Sergeitch
though
It
was
your
fancy
Marya
Pavlovna
added
coldly
What
is
this
'Upas
Tree
asked
Na
dyezhda
Alexyevna
i
Do
n't
you
know
answered
Astahov
Pushkin
's
poem
'on
poor
and
meagre
soil
do
n't
you
remember
it
I
do
n't
seem
to
It
's
about
a
poisonous
tree
is
n't
it
Yes
Like
the
datura
Do
you
remember
Masha
how
beautiful
the
datura
plants
were
on
our
balcony
in
the
moonlight
with
their
long
white
flowers
Do
you
remember
the
sweet
insidious
treacherous
scent
they
had
Treacherous
scent
cried
Vladimir
Serge
itch
Yes
treacherous
Why
does
that
surprise
you
They
say
it
is
dangerous
but
yet
it
at
tracts
one
How
is
it
evil
things
can
attract
one
What
is
evil
ought
not
to
be
lovely
Oho
What
profound
reflections
ob
served
Pyotr
Alexeitch
We
have
got
a
long
way
from
the
poem
I
repeated
that
poem
to
Marya
Pavlovna
yesterday
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
and
she
liked
it
extremely
Oh
do
repeat
it
please
said
Nadyezhda
A.lexyevna
Certainly
And
Astahov
repeated
The
Upas
Tree
Too
stilted
Veretyev
brought
out
as
it
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
were
reluctantly
as
soon
as
Vladimir
Sergeitch
had
finished
The
poem
is
too
stilted
No
not
the
poem
I
beg
your
pardon
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
did
not
repeat
it
simply
enough
The
thing
speaks
for
itself
however
I
may
be
mistaken
No
you
are
not
mistaken
said
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
emphatically
Oh
no
we
all
know
that
In
your
eyes
I
am
a
genius
a
gifted
person
who
knows
every
thing
and
can
do
everything
only
unluckily
he
is
too
lazy
that
's
it
is
n't
it
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
merely
nodded
her
head
I
do
n't
dispute
it
you
ought
to
know
better
than
I
observed
Vladimir
Sergeitch
and
be
came
a
little
sulky
It
is
not
in
my
line
Meanwhile
the
game
of
cards
was
over
Oh
by
the
way
Vladimir
Sergeitch
said
Ipatov
getting
up
a
gentleman
of
our
neigh
bourhood
a
most
excellent
and
worthy
man
Gavril
Stepanitch
Akilin
asks
you
to
do
him
the
honour
to
come
to
his
ball
That
is
I
call
it
a
ball
to
give
it
a
fine
name
but
it
is
simply
a
little
evening
party
a
dance
without
cere
mony
He
would
have
certainly
called
upon
you
himself
but
he
was
afraid
of
disturbing
you
I
am
very
grateful
to
the
gentleman
said
Vladimir
Sergeitch
but
I
absolutely
must
go
home
But
when
do
you
suppose
the
ball
is
It's
to-morrow
It
is
Gavril
Stepanitch
's
name-day
to-morrow
One
day
will
make
no
difference
and
you
will
give
him
so
much
pleasure
And
it
is
only
seven
miles
from
here
If
you
will
allow
us
we
'll
drive
you
there
I
really
do
n't
know
began
Vladimir
Serge
itch
Are
you
going
Yes
the
whole
family
Nadyezhda
Alex
yevna
and
Pyotr
Alexeitch
we
are
all
going
You
can
ask
me
for
the
fifth
quadrille
now
if
you
like
observed
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
the
first
four
arc
engaged
already
You
are
very
kind
and
are
you
engaged
for
the
mazurka
I
Let
me
think
No
I
believe
I
am
not
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
In
that
case
if
you
would
be
so
kind
I
should
like
to
have
the
honour
You
are
going
then
That
's
capital
Cer
tainly
Bravo
cried
Ipatov
Well
Vladimir
Serge
itch
that
is
nice
of
you
Gavril
Stepanitch
will
be
simply
delighted
wo
n't
he
Ivan
Ilyitch
Ivan
Ilyitch
would
have
liked
to
remain
silent
as
usual
but
thought
it
better
to
emit
a
sound
of
approval
What
possessed
you
Pyotr
Alexeitch
asked
his
sister
an
hour
later
as
he
sat
beside
her
in
a
light
chaise
which
he
drove
himself
what
possessed
you
to
force
yourself
on
that
muff
for
the
mazurka
I
have
my
own
reasons
answered
Nad
yezhda
Alexyevna
What
are
they
may
I
ask
That
's
my
secret
Oho
And
he
gave
a
light
switch
to
the
horse
which
had
begun
to
twitch
its
ears
snort
and
shy
It
was
frightened
by
the
shadow
of
a
big
bush
of
villow
that
lay
across
the
road
in
the
dim
moonHght
And
will
you
dance
it
with
Masha
Nad
yezhda
Alexyevna
questioned
her
brother
in
her
turn
Yes
he
answered
indifferently
Yes
Yes
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
repeated
reproachfully
You
men
she
added
after
a
pause
certainly
do
not
deserve
to
be
loved
by
decent
women
Do
n't
you
think
so
And
that
Petersburg
muff
does
he
deserve
to
be
Better
than
you
do
Oh
indeed
And
Pyotr
Alexeitch
declaimed
with
a
sigh
What
a
task
it
is
O
Lord
To
be
the
brother
of
a
grown-up
sister
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
laughed
I
give
you
a
lot
of
trouble
indeed
It
's
I
who
have
a
task
with
you
Really
I
did
not
suspect
it
I
am
not
talking
about
Masha
What
about
then
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
's
face
looked
a
little
troubled
You
know
very
well
she
said
softly
Oh
I
understand
There
's
no
help
for
it
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
I
am
fond
of
a
glass
of
wine
in
good
company
sinful
man
that
I
am
Hush
brother
please
do
n't
talk
like
that
It
's
not
a
joking
matter
Tram
tram
tam
poom
Pyotr
Alexeitch
muttered
between
his
teeth
It
will
be
your
ruin
and
you
make
a
joke
of
it
The
Peasant
Lad
the
Wheat
Is
Sowing
Pyotr
Alexeitch
sang
aloud
switched
the
horse
with
the
reins
and
it
broke
into
a
rapid
trot
CHAPTER
IV
When
he
got
home
Veretyev
did
not
undress
and
two
hours
later
when
the
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
glow
in
the
sky
he
was
out
of
the
house
Halfway
between
his
estate
and
Ipatov
's
on
the
precipitous
edge
of
a
broad
ravine
there
was
a
small
birch
copse
The
young
trees
were
growing
very
close
together
no
axe
had
yet
touched
their
slender
stems
a
patch
of
light
but
almost
unbroken
shadow
was
thrown
by
their
fine
leaves
on
the
soft
delicate
grass
all
spangled
with
the
golden
heads
of
hen-dazzle
the
white
specks
of
wood
harebells
and
the
crimson
crosses
of
the
wild
pinks
The
newly
risen
sun
flooded
the
whole
copse
with
vivid
but
not
glaring
light
dewdrops
were
glittering
on
all
sides
