it
Nature
is
gently
driving
us
to
other
living
embraces
but
we
don
t
understand
and
expect
something
from
nature
herself
Ah
Andrei
Andrei
this
sun
this
sky
is
beautiful
everything
around
us
is
beautiful
still
you
are
sad
but
if
at
this
instant
you
were
holding
the
hand
of
a
woman
you
loved
if
that
hand
and
the
whole
woman
were
yours
if
you
were
even
seeing
with
her
eyes
feeling
not
your
own
isolated
emotion
but
her
emotion
nature
would
not
make
you
melancholy
or
restless
then
and
you
would
not
be
observing
nature
s
beauty
nature
herself
would
be
full
of
joy
and
praise
she
would
be
re-echoing
your
hymn
because
then
you
would
have
given
her
dumb
nature
speech
Shubin
leaped
on
to
his
feet
and
walked
twice
up
and
down
but
Bersenyev
bent
his
head
and
his
face
was
overcast
by
a
faint
flush
I
don
t
altogether
agree
with
you
he
began
nature
does
not
always
urge
us
towards
love
He
could
not
at
once
pronounce
the
word
Nature
threatens
us
too
she
reminds
us
of
dreadful
yes
insoluble
mysteries
Is
she
not
destined
to
swallow
us
up
is
she
not
swallowing
us
up
unceasingly
She
holds
life
and
death
as
well
and
death
speaks
in
her
as
loudly
as
life
In
love
too
there
is
both
life
and
death
interposed
Shubin
And
then
Bersenyev
went
on
when
I
for
example
stand
in
the
spring
in
the
forest
in
a
green
glade
when
I
can
fancy
the
romantic
notes
of
Oberon
s
fairy
horn
Bersenyev
was
a
little
ashamed
when
he
had
spoken
these
words
is
that
too
The
thirst
for
love
the
thirst
for
happiness
nothing
more
broke
in
Shubin
I
too
know
those
notes
I
know
the
languor
and
the
expectation
which
come
upon
the
soul
in
the
forest
s
shade
in
its
deep
recesses
or
at
evening
in
the
open
fields
when
the
sun
sets
and
the
river
mist
rises
behind
the
bushes
But
forest
and
river
and
fields
and
sky
every
cloud
and
every
blade
of
grass
sets
me
expecting
hoping
for
happiness
I
feel
the
approach
I
hear
the
voice
of
happiness
calling
in
everything
God
of
my
worship
bright
and
gay
That
was
how
I
tried
to
begin
my
sole
poem
you
must
own
it
s
a
splendid
first
line
but
I
could
never
produce
a
second
Happiness
happiness
as
long
as
life
is
not
over
as
long
as
we
have
the
use
of
all
our
limbs
as
long
as
we
are
going
up
not
down
hill
Damn
it
all
pursued
Shubin
with
sudden
vehemence
we
are
young
and
neither
fools
nor
monsters
we
will
conquer
happiness
for
ourselves
He
shook
his
curls
and
turned
a
confident
almost
challenging
glance
upwards
to
the
sky
Bersenyev
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
at
him
Is
there
nothing
higher
than
happiness
he
commented
softly
And
what
for
instance
asked
Shubin
stopping
short
Why
for
instance
you
and
I
are
as
you
say
young
we
are
good
men
let
us
suppose
each
of
us
desires
happiness
for
himself
But
is
that
word
happiness
one
that
could
unite
us
set
us
both
on
fire
and
make
us
clasp
each
other
s
hands
Isn
t
that
word
an
egoistic
one
I
mean
isn
t
it
a
source
of
disunion
Do
you
know
words
then
that
unite
men
Yes
and
they
are
not
few
in
number
and
you
know
them
too
Eh
What
words
Well
even
Art
since
you
are
an
artist
Country
Science
Freedom
Justice
And
what
of
love
asked
Shubin
Love
too
is
a
word
that
unites
but
not
the
love
you
are
eager
for
now
the
love
which
is
not
enjoyment
the
love
which
is
self-sacrifice
Shubin
frowned
That
s
all
very
well
for
Germans
I
want
to
love
for
myself
I
want
to
be
first
To
be
first
repeated
Bersenyev
But
it
seems
to
me
that
to
put
one
s-self
in
the
second
place
is
the
whole
significance
of
our
life
If
all
men
were
to
act
as
you
advise
commented
Shubin
with
a
plaintive
expression
none
on
earth
would
eat
pine-apples
every
one
would
be
offering
them
to
other
people
That
s
as
much
as
to
say
pine-apples
are
not
necessary
but
you
need
not
be
alarmed
there
will
always
be
plenty
of
people
who
like
them
enough
to
take
the
bread
out
of
other
men
s
mouths
to
get
them
Both
friends
were
silent
a
little
I
met
Insarov
again
the
other
day
began
Bersenyev
I
invited
him
to
stay
with
me
I
really
must
introduce
him
to
you
and
to
the
Stahovs
Who
is
Insarov
Ah
to
be
sure
isn
t
it
that
Servian
or
Bulgarian
you
were
telling
me
about
The
patriot
Now
isn
t
it
he
who
s
at
the
bottom
of
all
these
philosophical
ideas
Perhaps
Is
he
an
exceptional
individual
Yes
Clever
Talented
Clever
talented
I
don
t
know
I
don
t
think
so
Not
Then
what
is
there
remarkable
in
him
You
shall
see
But
now
I
think
it
s
time
to
be
going
Anna
Vassilyevna
will
be
waiting
for
us
very
likely
What
s
the
time
Three
o
clock
Let
us
go
How
baking
it
is
This
conversation
has
set
all
my
blood
aflame
There
was
a
moment
when
you
too
I
am
not
an
artist
for
nothing
I
observe
everything
Confess
you
are
interested
in
a
woman
Shubin
tried
to
get
a
look
at
Bersenyev
s
face
but
he
turned
away
and
walked
out
of
the
lime-tree
s
shade
Shubin
went
after
him
moving
his
little
feet
with
easy
grace
Bersenyev
walked
clumsily
with
his
shoulders
high
and
his
neck
craned
forward
Yet
he
looked
a
man
of
finer
breeding
than
Shubin
more
of
a
gentleman
one
might
say
if
that
word
had
not
been
so
vulgarised
among
us
The
young
men
went
down
to
the
river
Moskva
and
walked
along
its
bank
There
was
a
breath
of
freshness
from
the
water
and
the
soft
plash
of
tiny
waves
caressed
the
ear
I
would
have
another
bathe
said
Shubin
only
I
m
afraid
of
being
late
Look
at
the
river
it
seems
to
beckon
us
The
ancient
Greeks
would
have
beheld
a
nymph
in
it
But
we
are
not
Greeks
O
nymph
we
are
thick-skinned
Scythians
We
have
roussalkas
observed
Bersenyev
Get
along
with
your
roussalkas
What
s
the
use
to
me
a
sculptor
of
those
children
of
a
cold
terror-stricken
fancy
those
shapes
begotten
in
the
stifling
hut
in
the
dark
of
winter
nights
I
want
light
space
Good
God
when
shall
I
go
to
Italy
When
To
Little
Russia
I
suppose
you
mean
For
shame
Andrei
Petrovitch
to
reproach
me
for
an
act
of
unpremeditated
folly
which
I
have
repented
bitterly
enough
without
that
Oh
of
course
I
behaved
like
a
fool
Anna
Vassilyevna
most
kindly
gave
me
the
money
for
an
expedition
to
Italy
and
I
went
off
to
the
Little
Russians
to
eat
dumplings
and
Don
t
let
me
have
the
rest
please
interposed
Bersenyev
Yet
still
I
will
say
the
money
was
not
spent
in
vain
I
saw
there
such
types
especially
of
women
Of
course
I
know
there
is
no
salvation
to
be
found
outside
of
Italy
You
will
go
to
Italy
said
Bersenyev
without
turning
towards
him
and
will
do
nothing
You
will
always
be
pluming
your
wings
and
never
take
flight
We
know
you
Stavasser
has
taken
flight
And
he
s
not
the
only
one
If
I
don
t
fly
it
will
prove
that
I
m
a
sea
penguin
and
have
no
wings
I
am
stifled
here
I
want
to
be
in
Italy
pursued
Shubin
there
is
sunshine
there
is
beauty
A
young
girl
in
a
large
straw
hat
with
a
pink
parasol
on
her
shoulder
came
into
sight
at
that
instant
in
the
little
path
along
which
the
friends
were
walking
But
what
do
I
see
Even
here
there
is
beauty
coming
to
meet
us
A
humble
artist
s
compliments
to
the
enchanting
Zoya
Shubin
cried
at
once
with
a
theatrical
flourish
of
his
hat
The
young
girl
to
whom
this
exclamation
referred
stopped
threatening
him
with
her
finger
and
waiting
for
the
two
friends
to
come
up
to
her
she
said
in
a
ringing
voice
Why
is
it
gentlemen
you
don
t
come
in
to
dinner
It
is
on
the
table
What
do
I
hear
said
Shubin
throwing
his
arms
up
Can
it
be
that
you
bewitching
Zoya
faced
such
heat
to
come
and
look
for
us
Dare
I
think
that
is
the
meaning
of
your
words
Tell
me
can
it
be
so
Or
no
do
not
utter
that
word
I
shall
die
of
regret
on
the
spot
Oh
do
leave
off
Pavel
Yakovlitch
replied
the
young
girl
with
some
annoyance
Why
will
you
never
talk
to
me
seriously
I
shall
be
angry
she
added
with
a
little
coquettish
grimace
and
she
pouted
You
will
not
be
angry
with
me
ideal
Zoya
Nikitishna
you
would
not
drive
me
to
the
dark
depths
of
hopeless
despair
And
I
can
t
talk
to
you
seriously
because
I
m
not
a
serious
person
The
young
girl
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
to
Bersenyev
There
he
s
always
like
that
he
treats
me
like
a
child
and
I
am
eighteen
I
am
grown-up
now
O
Lord
groaned
Shubin
rolling
his
eyes
upwards
and
Bersenyev
smiled
quietly
The
girl
stamped
with
her
little
foot
Pavel
Yakovlitch
I
shall
be
angry
Helene
was
coming
with
me
she
went
on
but
she
stopped
in
the
garden
The
heat
frightened
her
but
I
am
not
afraid
of
the
heat
Come
along
She
moved
forward
along
the
path
slightly
swaying
her
slender
figure
at
each
step
and
with
a
pretty
black-mittened
little
hand
pushing
her
long
soft
curls
back
from
her
face
The
friends
walked
after
her
Shubin
first
pressed
his
hands
without
speaking
to
his
heart
and
then
flung
them
higher
than
his
head
and
in
a
few
instants
they
came
out
in
front
of
one
of
the
numerous
country
villas
with
which
Kuntsovo
is
surrounded
A
small
wooden
house
with
a
gable
painted
a
pink
colour
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
and
seemed
to
be
peeping
out
innocently
from
behind
the
green
trees
Zoya
was
the
first
to
open
the
gate
she
ran
into
the
garden
crying
I
have
brought
the
wanderers
A
young
girl
with
a
pale
and
expressive
face
rose
from
a
garden
bench
near
the
little
path
and
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
appeared
a
lady
in
a
lilac
silk
dress
holding
an
embroidered
cambric
handkerchief
over
her
head
to
screen
it
from
the
sun
and
smiling
with
a
weary
and
listless
air
Anna
Vassilyevna
Stahov
her
maiden
name
was
Shubin
had
been
left
at
seven
years
old
an
orphan
and
heiress
of
a
pretty
considerable
property
She
had
very
rich
and
also
very
poor
relations
the
poor
relations
were
on
her
father
s
the
rich
on
her
mother
s
side
the
latter
including
the
senator
Volgin
and
the
Princes
Tchikurasov
Prince
Ardalion
Tchikurasov
who
had
been
appointed
her
guardian
placed
her
in
the
best
Moscow
boarding-school
and
when
she
left
school
took
her
into
his
own
home
He
kept
open
house
and
gave
balls
in
the
winter
Anna
Vassilyevna
s
future
husband
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
Stahov
captured
her
heart
at
one
of
these
balls
when
she
was
arrayed
in
a
charming
rose-coloured
gown
with
a
wreath
of
tiny
roses
She
had
treasured
that
wreath
all
her
life
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
Stahov
was
the
son
of
a
retired
captain
who
had
been
wounded
in
1812
and
had
received
a
lucrative
post
in
Petersburg
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
entered
the
School
of
Cadets
at
sixteen
and
left
to
go
into
the
Guards
He
was
a
handsome
well-made
fellow
and
reckoned
almost
the
most
dashing
beau
at
evening
parties
of
the
middling
sort
which
were
those
he
frequented
for
the
most
part
he
had
not
gained
a
footing
in
the
best
society
From
his
youth
he
had
been
absorbed
by
two
ideals
to
get
into
the
Imperial
adjutants
and
to
make
a
good
marriage
the
first
ideal
he
soon
discarded
but
he
clung
all
the
more
closely
to
the
second
and
it
was
with
that
object
that
he
went
every
winter
to
Moscow
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
spoke
French
fairly
and
passed
for
being
a
philosopher
because
he
was
not
a
rake
Even
while
he
was
no
more
than
an
ensign
he
was
given
to
discussing
persistently
such
questions
as
whether
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
visit
the
whole
of
the
globe
in
the
course
of
his
whole
lifetime
whether
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
know
what
is
happening
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
he
always
maintained
the
view
that
these
things
were
impossible
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
was
twenty-five
years
old
when
he
hooked
Anna
Vassilyevna
he
retired
from
the
service
and
went
into
the
country
to
manage
the
property
He
was
soon
tired
of
country
life
and
as
the
peasants
labour
was
all
commuted
for
rent
he
could
easily
leave
the
estate
he
settled
in
Moscow
in
his
wife
s
house
In
his
youth
he
had
played
no
games
of
any
kind
but
now
he
developed
a
passion
for
loto
and
when
loto
was
prohibited
for
whist
At
home
he
was
bored
he
formed
a
connection
with
a
widow
of
German
extraction
and
spent
almost
all
his
time
with
her
In
the
year
1853
he
had
not
moved
to
Kuntsovo
he
stopped
at
Moscow
ostensibly
to
take
advantage
of
the
mineral
waters
in
reality
he
did
not
want
to
part
from
his
widow
He
did
not
however
have
much
conversation
with
her
but
argued
more
than
ever
as
to
whether
one
can
foretell
the
weather
and
such
questions
Some
one
had
once
called
him
a
frondeur
he
was
greatly
delighted
with
that
name
Yes
he
thought
letting
the
corners
of
his
mouth
drop
complacently
and
shaking
his
head
I
am
not
easily
satisfied
you
won
t
take
me
in
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
s
frondeurism
consisted
in
saying
for
instance
when
he
heard
the
word
nerves
And
what
do
you
mean
by
nerves
or
if
some
one
alluded
in
his
presence
to
the
discoveries
of
astronomy
asking
And
do
you
believe
in
astronomy
When
he
wanted
to
overwhelm
his
opponent
completely
he
said
All
that
is
nothing
but
words
It
must
be
admitted
that
to
many
persons
remarks
of
that
kind
seemed
and
still
seem
irrefutable
arguments
But
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
never
suspected
that
Augustina
Christianovna
in
letters
to
her
cousin
Theodolina
Peterzelius
called
him
Mein
Pinselchen
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
s
wife
Anna
Vassilyevna
was
a
thin
little
woman
with
delicate
features
and
a
tendency
to
be
emotional
and
melancholy
At
school
she
had
devoted
herself
to
music
and
reading
novels
afterwards
she
abandoned
all
that
She
began
to
be
absorbed
in
dress
and
that
too
she
gave
up
She
did
for
a
time
undertake
her
daughter
s
education
but
she
got
tired
of
that
too
and
handed
her
over
to
a
governess
She
ended
by
spending
her
whole
time
in
sentimental
brooding
and
tender
melancholy
The
birth
of
Elena
Nikolaevna
had
ruined
her
health
and
she
could
never
have
another
child
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
used
to
hint
at
this
fact
in
justification
of
his
intimacy
with
Augustina
Christianovna
Her
husband
s
infidelity
wounded
Anna
Vassilyevna
deeply
she
had
been
specially
hurt
by
his
once
giving
his
German
woman
on
the
sly
a
pair
of
grey
horses
out
of
her
Anna
Vassilyevna
s
own
stable
She
had
never
reproached
him
to
his
face
but
she
complained
of
him
secretly
to
every
one
in
the
house
in
turn
even
to
her
daughter
Anna
Vassilyevna
did
not
care
for
going
out
she
liked
visitors
to
come
and
sit
with
her
and
talk
to
her
she
collapsed
at
once
when
she
was
left
alone
She
had
a
very
tender
and
loving
heart
life
had
soon
crushed
her
Pavel
Yakovlitch
Shubin
happened
to
be
a
distant
cousin
of
hers
His
father
had
been
a
government
official
in
Moscow
His
brothers
had
entered
cadets
corps
he
was
the
youngest
his
mother
s
darling
and
of
delicate
constitution
he
stopped
at
home
They
intended
him
for
the
university
and
strained
every
effort
to
keep
him
at
the
gymnasium
From
his
early
years
he
began
to
show
an
inclination
for
sculpture
The
ponderous
senator
Volgin
saw
a
statuette
of
his
one
day
at
his
aunt
s
he
was
then
sixteen
and
declared
that
he
intended
to
protect
this
youthful
genius
The
sudden
death
of
Shubin
s
father
very
nearly
effected
a
complete
transformation
in
the
young
man
s
future
The
senator
the
patron
of
genius
made
him
a
present
of
a
bust
of
Homer
in
plaster
and
did
nothing
more
But
Anna
Vassilyevna
helped
him
with
money
and
at
nineteen
he
scraped
through
into
the
university
in
the
faculty
of
medicine
Pavel
felt
no
inclination
for
medical
science
but
as
the
university
was
then
constituted
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
enter
in
any
other
faculty
Besides
he
looked
forward
to
studying
anatomy
But
he
did
not
complete
his
anatomical
studies
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
and
before
the
examination
he
left
the
university
to
devote
himself
exclusively
to
his
vocation
He
worked
zealously
but
by
fits
and
starts
he
used
to
stroll
about
the
country
round
Moscow
sketching
and
modelling
portraits
of
peasant
girls
and
striking
up
acquaintance
with
all
sorts
of
people
young
and
old
of
high
and
low
degree
Italian
models
and
Russian
artists
He
would
not
hear
of
the
Academy
and
recognised
no
one
as
a
teacher
He
was
possessed
of
unmistakeable
talent
it
began
to
be
talked
about
in
Moscow
His
mother
who
came
of
a
good
Parisian
family
a
kind-hearted
and
clever
woman
had
taught
him
French
thoroughly
and
had
toiled
and
thought
for
him
day
and
night
She
was
proud
of
him
and
when
while
still
young
in
years
she
died
of
consumption
she
entreated
Anna
Vassilyevna
to
take
him
under
her
care
He
was
at
that
time
twenty-one
Anna
Vassilyevna
carried
out
her
last
wish
a
small
room
in
the
lodge
of
the
country
villa
was
given
up
to
him
Come
to
dinner
come
along
said
the
lady
of
the
house
in
a
plaintive
voice
and
they
all
went
into
the
dining-room
Sit
beside
me
Zoe
added
Anna
Vassilyevna
and
you
Helene
take
our
guest
and
you
Paul
please
don
t
be
naughty
and
tease
Zoe
My
head
aches
to-day
Shubin
again
turned
his
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
Zoe
responded
with
a
half-smile
This
Zoe
or
to
speak
more
precisely
Zoya
Nikitishna
Mueller
was
a
pretty
fair-haired
half-Russian
German
girl
with
a
little
nose
rather
wide
at
the
end
and
tiny
red
lips
She
sang
Russian
ballads
fairly
well
and
could
play
various
pieces
both
lively
and
sentimental
very
correctly
on
the
piano
She
dressed
with
taste
but
in
a
rather
childish
style
and
even
over-precisely
Anna
Vassilyevna
had
taken
her
as
a
companion
for
her
daughter
and
she
kept
her
almost
constantly
at
her
side
Elena
did
not
complain
of
that
she
was
absolutely
at
a
loss
what
to
say
to
Zoya
when
she
happened
to
be
left
alone
with
her
The
dinner
lasted
rather
a
long
time
Bersenyev
talked
with
Elena
about
university
life
and
his
own
plans
and
hopes
Shubin
listened
without
speaking
ate
with
an
exaggerated
show
of
greediness
and
now
and
then
threw
comic
glances
of
despair
at
Zoya
who
responded
always
with
the
same
phlegmatic
smile
After
dinner
Elena
with
Bersenyev
and
Shubin
went
into
the
garden
Zoya
looked
after
them
and
with
a
slight
shrug
of
her
shoulders
sat
down
to
the
piano
Anna
Vassilyevna
began
Why
don
t
you
go
for
a
walk
too
but
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
added
Play
me
something
melancholy
La
derniere
pensee
de
Weber
suggested
Zoya
Ah
yes
Weber
replied
Anna
Vassilyevna
She
sank
into
an
easy
chair
and
the
tears
started
on
to
her
eyelashes
Meanwhile
Elena
led
the
two
friends
to
an
arbour
of
acacias
with
a
little
wooden
table
in
the
middle
and
seats
round
Shubin
looked
round
and
whispering
Wait
a
minute
he
ran
off
skipping
and
hopping
to
his
own
room
brought
back
a
piece
of
clay
and
began
modelling
a
bust
of
Zoya
shaking
his
head
and
muttering
and
laughing
to
himself
At
his
old
tricks
again
observed
Elena
glancing
at
his
work
She
turned
to
Bersenyev
with
whom
she
was
continuing
the
conversation
begun
at
dinner
My
old
tricks
repeated
Shubin
It
s
a
subject
that
s
simply
inexhaustible
To-day
particularly
she
drove
me
out
of
all
patience
Why
so
inquired
Elena
One
would
think
you
were
speaking
of
some
spiteful
disagreeable
old
woman
She
is
a
pretty
young
girl
Of
course
Shubin
broke
in
she
is
pretty
very
pretty
I
am
sure
that
no
one
who
meets
her
could
fail
to
think
that
s
some
one
I
should
like
to
dance
a
polka
with
I
m
sure
too
that
she
knows
that
and
is
pleased
Else
what
s
the
meaning
of
those
modest
simpers
that
discreet
air
There
you
know
what
I
mean
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
But
now
you
re
absorbed
in
something
else
And
breaking
up
the
bust
of
Zoya
Shubin
set
hastily
to
modelling
and
kneading
the
clay
again
with
an
air
of
vexation
So
it
is
your
wish
to
be
a
professor
said
Elena
to
Bersenyev
Yes
he
answered
squeezing
his
red
hands
between
his
knees
That
s
my
cherished
dream
Of
course
I
know
very
well
how
far
I
fall
short
of
being
to
be
worthy
of
such
a
high
I
mean
that
I
am
too
little
prepared
but
I
hope
to
get
permission
for
a
course
of
travel
abroad
I
shall
pass
three
or
four
years
in
that
way
if
necessary
and
then
He
stopped
dropped
his
eyes
then
quickly
raising
them
again
he
gave
an
embarrassed
smile
and
smoothed
his
hair
When
Bersenyev
was
talking
to
a
woman
his
words
came
out
more
slowly
and
he
lisped
more
than
ever
You
want
to
be
a
professor
of
history
inquired
Elena
Yes
or
of
philosophy
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
if
that
is
possible
He
s
a
perfect
devil
at
philosophy
already
observed
Shubin
making
deep
lines
in
the
clay
with
his
nail
What
does
he
want
to
go
abroad
for
And
will
you
be
perfectly
contented
with
such
a
position
asked
Elena
leaning
on
her
elbow
and
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
Perfectly
Elena
Nikolaevna
perfectly
What
could
be
a
finer
vocation
To
follow
perhaps
in
the
steps
of
Timofay
Nikolaevitch
The
very
thought
of
such
work
fills
me
with
delight
and
confusion
yes
confusion
which
comes
from
a
sense
of
my
own
deficiency
My
dear
father
consecrated
me
to
this
work
I
shall
never
forget
his
last
words
Your
father
died
last
winter
Yes
Elena
Nikolaevna
in
February
They
say
Elena
went
on
that
he
left
a
remarkable
work
in
manuscript
is
it
true
Yes
He
was
a
wonderful
man
You
would
have
loved
him
Elena
Nikolaevna
I
am
sure
I
should
And
what
was
the
subject
of
the
work
To
give
you
an
idea
of
the
subject
of
the
work
in
few
words
Elena
Nikolaevna
would
be
somewhat
difficult
My
father
was
a
learned
man
a
Schellingist
he
used
terms
which
were
not
always
very
clear
Andrei
Petrovitch
interrupted
Elena
excuse
my
ignorance
what
does
that
mean
a
Schellingist
Bersenyev
smiled
slightly
A
Schellingist
means
a
follower
of
Schelling
a
German
philosopher
and
what
the
philosophy
of
Schelling
consists
in
Andrei
Petrovitch
cried
Shubin
suddenly
for
mercy
s
sake
Surely
you
don
t
mean
to
give
Elena
Nikolaevna
a
lecture
on
Schelling
Have
pity
on
her
Not
a
lecture
at
all
murmured
Bersenyev
turning
crimson
I
meant
And
why
not
a
lecture
put
in
Elena
You
and
I
are
in
need
of
lectures
Pavel
Yakovlitch
Shubin
stared
at
her
and
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
What
are
you
laughing
at
she
said
coldly
and
almost
sharply
Shubin
did
not
answer
Come
don
t
be
angry
he
said
after
a
short
pause
I
am
sorry
But
really
it
s
a
strange
taste
upon
my
word
to
discuss
philosophy
in
weather
like
this
under
these
trees
Let
us
rather
talk
of
nightingales
and
roses
youthful
eyes
and
smiles
Yes
and
of
French
novels
and
of
feminine
frills
and
fal-lals
Elena
went
on
Fal-lals
too
of
course
rejoined
Shubin
if
they
re
pretty
Of
course
But
suppose
we
don
t
want
to
talk
of
frills
You
are
always
boasting
of
being
a
free
artist
why
do
you
encroach
on
the
freedom
of
others
And
allow
me
to
inquire
if
that
s
your
bent
of
mind
why
do
you
attack
Zoya
With
her
it
would
be
peculiarly
suitable
to
talk
of
frills
and
roses
Shubin
suddenly
fired
up
and
rose
from
the
garden
seat
So
that
s
it
he
began
in
a
nervous
voice
I
understand
your
hint
you
want
to
send
me
away
to
her
Elena
Nikolaevna
In
other
words
I
m
not
wanted
here
I
never
thought
of
sending
you
away
from
here
Do
you
mean
to
say
Shubin
continued
passionately
that
I
am
not
worthy
of
other
society
that
I
am
her
equal
that
I
am
as
vain
and
silly
and
petty
as
that
mawkish
German
girl
Is
that
it
Elena
frowned
You
did
not
always
speak
like
that
of
her
Pavel
Yakovlitch
she
remarked
Ah
reproaches
reproaches
now
cried
Shubin
Well
then
I
don
t
deny
there
was
a
moment
one
moment
precisely
when
those
fresh
vulgar
cheeks
of
hers
But
if
I
wanted
to
repay
you
with
reproaches
and
remind
you
Good-bye
he
added
suddenly
I
feel
I
shall
say
something
silly
And
with
a
blow
on
the
clay
moulded
into
the
shape
of
a
head
he
ran
out
of
the
arbour
and
went
off
to
his
room
What
a
baby
said
Elena
looking
after
him
He
s
an
artist
observed
Bersenyev
with
a
quiet
smile
All
artists
are
like
that
One
must
forgive
them
their
caprices
That
is
their
privilege
Yes
replied
Elena
but
Pavel
has
not
so
far
justified
his
claim
to
that
privilege
in
any
way
What
has
he
done
so
far
Give
me
your
arm
and
let
us
go
along
the
avenue
He
was
in
our
way
We
were
talking
of
your
father
s
works
Bersenyev
took
Elena
s
arm
in
his
and
walked
beside
her
through
the
garden
but
the
conversation
prematurely
broken
off
was
not
renewed
Bersenyev
began
again
unfolding
his
views
on
the
vocation
of
a
professor
and
on
his
own
future
career
He
walked
slowly
beside
Elena
moving
awkwardly
awkwardly
holding
her
arm
sometimes
jostling
his
shoulder
against
her
and
not
once
looking
at
her
but
his
talk
flowed
more
easily
even
if
not
perfectly
freely
he
spoke
simply
and
genuinely
and
his
eyes
as
they
strayed
slowly
over
the
trunks
of
the
trees
the
sand
of
the
path
and
the
grass
were
bright
with
the
quiet
ardour
of
generous
emotions
while
in
his
soothed
voice
there
was
heard
the
delight
of
a
man
who
feels
that
he
is
succeeding
in
expressing
himself
to
one
very
dear
to
him
Elena
listened
to
him
very
attentively
and
turning
half
towards
him
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
his
face
which
had
grown
a
little
paler
off
his
eyes
which
were
soft
and
affectionate
though
they
avoided
meeting
her
eyes
Her
soul
expanded
and
something
tender
holy
and
good
seemed
half
sinking
into
her
heart
half
springing
up
within
it
Shubin
did
not
leave
his
room
before
night
It
was
already
quite
dark
the
moon
not
yet
at
the
full
stood
high
in
the
sky
the
milky
way
shone
white
and
the
stars
spotted
the
heavens
when
Bersenyev
after
taking
leave
of
Anna
Vassilyevna
Elena
and
Zoya
went
up
to
his
friend
s
door
He
found
it
locked
He
knocked
Who
is
there
sounded
Shubin
s
voice
I
answered
Bersenyev
What
do
you
want
Let
me
in
Pavel
don
t
be
sulky
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
yourself
I
am
not
sulky
I
m
asleep
and
dreaming
about
Zoya
Do
stop
that
please
you
re
not
a
baby
Let
me
in
I
want
to
talk
to
you
Haven
t
you
had
talk
enough
with
Elena
Come
come
let
me
in
Shubin
responded
by
a
pretended
snore
Bersenyev
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
homewards
The
night
was
warm
and
seemed
strangely
still
as
though
everything
were
listening
and
expectant
and
Bersenyev
enfolded
in
the
still
darkness
stopped
involuntarily
and
he
too
listened
expectant
On
the
tree-tops
near
there
was
a
faint
stir
like
the
rustle
of
a
woman
s
dress
awaking
in
him
a
feeling
half-sweet
half-painful
a
feeling
almost
of
fright
He
felt
a
tingling
in
his
cheeks
his
eyes
were
chill
with
momentary
tears
he
would
have
liked
to
move
quite
noiselessly
to
steal
along
in
secret
A
cross
gust
of
wind
blew
suddenly
on
him
he
almost
shuddered
and
his
heart
stood
still
a
drowsy
beetle
fell
off
a
twig
and
dropped
with
a
thud
on
the
path
Bersenyev
uttered
a
subdued
Ah
and
again
stopped
But
he
began
to
think
of
Elena
and
all
these
passing
sensations
vanished
at
once
there
remained
only
the
reviving
sense
of
the
night
freshness
of
the
walk
by
night
his
whole
soul
was
absorbed
by
the
image
of
the
young
girl
Bersenyev
walked
with
bent
head
recalling
her
words
her
questions
He
fancied
he
heard
the
tramp
of
quick
steps
behind
He
listened
some
one
was
running
some
one
was
overtaking
him
he
heard
panting
and
suddenly
from
a
black
circle
of
shadow
cast
by
a
huge
tree
Shubin
sprang
out
before
him
quite
pale
in
the
light
of
the
moon
with
no
cap
on
his
disordered
curls
I
am
glad
you
came
along
this
