am
unknown
to
you
Then
what
do
you
want
Well
I
know
I
repeated
I
understood
very
well
that
I
ought
to
take
advantage
of
this
excellent
opening
to
go
fur
ther
that
my
repetitions
I
know
everything
I
know
were
becoming
ridiculous
but
my
emotion
was
so
great
this
unexpected
meeting
so
troubled
me
I
was
so
overwhelmed
that
I
was
absolutely
unable
to
say
anything
else
And
all
the
while
I
really
knew
nothing
I
felt
that
I
was
being
stupid
that
from
a
mys
terious
omniscient
being
such
as
I
must
have
seemed
to
her
at
first
I
was
rapidly
turning
into
a
sort
of
grinning
idiot
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
Yes
I
know
everything
I
muttered
once
more
She
looked
at
me
hurriedly
got
up
and
was
about
to
retreat
But
that
would
have
been
too
much
I
clutched
at
her
hand
For
God
's
sake
I
be
gan
sit
down
listen
to
me
She
thought
a
moment
and
sat
down
I
told
you
just
now
I
went
on
with
fer
vour
that
I
know
everything
that
is
nonsense
I
know
nothing
absolutely
nothing
I
don't
THREE
MEETINGS
know
who
you
are
or
who
'he
is
and
that
I
could
astound
you
by
what
I
said
just
now
by
the
column
you
must
put
down
to
chance
alone
a
strange
incomprehensible
chance
which
as
though
in
mockery
of
me
threw
me
beside
you
twice
and
almost
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
made
me
the
involuntary
witness
of
what
you
desired
perhaps
to
keep
secret
And
on
the
spot
without
suppressing
or
al
tering
anything
I
told
her
the
whole
story
my
meeting
with
her
in
Sorrento
in
Russia
my
vain
enquiries
at
Mihailovskoye
even
my
con
versation
in
Moscow
with
Madame
Shlykov
and
her
sister
Now
you
know
all
about
it
I
said
as
I
fin
ished
my
story
I
am
not
going
to
describe
to
you
what
a
deep
what
a
shattering
impres
sion
you
made
upon
me
to
see
you
and
not
be
enchanted
by
you
is
impossible
On
the
other
hand
there
is
no
object
in
my
telling
you
what
sort
of
impression
it
was
either
Think
un
der
what
circumstances
I
saw
you
on
both
oc
casions
Believe
me
I
have
no
inclination
to
abandon
myself
to
mad
hopes
but
you
will
un
derstand
also
the
unutterable
emotion
which
overwhelmed
me
to-day
and
will
pardon
me
will
pardon
the
awkward
duplicity
to
which
I
brought
myself
to
resort
to
attract
your
atten
tion
if
only
for
a
moment
She
listened
to
my
confused
explanations
without
raising
her
head
What
do
you
want
from
me
she
said
at
last
Want
I
want
nothing
I
am
happy
as
it
is
I
have
too
much
respect
for
the
se
crets
of
others
Really
Yet
you
seem
so
far
How
ever
she
went
on
I
don't
want
to
reproach
you
Anyone
would
have
done
the
same
in
your
place
Besides
chance
really
has
so
per
sistently
thrown
us
together
That
as
it
were
gives
you
a
certain
claim
on
my
candour
Lis
ten
I
am
not
one
of
those
misunderstood
and
unhappy
women
who
go
to
masked
balls
to
chatter
to
the
first
person
they
meet
of
their
sufferings
who
want
to
find
hearts
filled
with
sympathy
I
need
no
one
's
sympathy
my
own
heart
is
dead
and
I
have
come
here
sim
ply
to
bury
it
for
ever
She
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
THREE
MEETINGS
I
hope
sHe
went
on
with
some
effort
that
you
do
not
take
my
words
for
the
ordinary
masquerade
outpourings
You
must
under
stand
that
I
am
in
no
mood
for
that
And
certainly
there
was
something
terrible
in
her
voice
for
all
the
insinuating
softness
of
its
tone
I
am
Russian
she
said
in
Russian
till
then
she
had
spoken
French
though
I
have
lived
little
in
Russia
There
is
no
need
for
you
to
know
my
name
Anna
Fyodorovna
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
I
did
in
fact
go
down
to
Mihailovskoye
in
her
sister
's
name
At
that
time
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
see
him
openly
and
people
were
beginning
to
talk
as
it
was
At
that
time
there
were
obstacles
he
was
not
free
But
the
man
whose
name
should
have
been
mine
the
man
with
whom
you
saw
me
has
abandoned
me
She
made
a
movement
with
her
hand
and
paused
You
really
do
not
know
him
you
have
not
met
him
Not
once
He
has
been
almost
all
this
time
abroad
But
he
is
here
now
That
is
all
my
story
she
added
you
see
there
is
nothing
mysteri
ous
nothing
special
in
it
And
Sorrento
I
broke
in
timidly
I
got
to
know
him
in
Sorrento
she
an
swered
slowly
and
she
sank
into
musing
We
were
both
silent
I
was
strangely
troubled
I
was
sitting
beside
her
beside
the
woman
whose
image
had
so
often
haunted
my
dreams
and
had
so
poignantly
thrilled
and
dis
turbed
me
I
was
sitting
beside
her
and
felt
a
chill
and
a
weight
on
my
heart
I
knew
that
nothing
would
come
of
this
meeting
that
be
tween
her
and
me
there
was
an
abyss
that
when
we
separated
we
should
part
for
ever
With
her
head
craned
forward
and
both
hands
dropped
on
her
knees
she
sat
carelessly
and
apathetically
I
know
that
carelessness
of
grief
that
can
not
be
healed
I
know
the
apathy
of
hopeless
misery
Masked
figures
walked
by
us
in
couples
the
strains
of
the
mad
and
monotonous
valse
sounded
at
one
minute
dimly
in
the
distance
at
the
next
floated
to
us
in
shrill
gusts
of
sound
the
gay
dance
music
moved
me
to
dejection
THREE
MEETINGS
and
melancholy
Can
this
be
the
woman
I
thought
who
appeared
to
nie
at
the
window
of
that
far-away
little
country
house
in
all
the
glory
of
triumphant
beauty
And
yet
it
seemed
as
though
time
had
not
touched
her
The
lower
part
of
her
face
not
covered
by
her
lace
mask
had
almost
the
softness
of
childhood
but
there
was
a
chilliness
about
it
as
about
a
statue
Galatea
had
stepped
back
onto
her
pedestal
and
there
would
be
no
coming
down
from
it
again
All
at
once
she
drew
herself
up
looked
towards
the
other
room
and
rose
from
her
seat
Give
me
your
arm
she
said
make
haste
let
us
go
make
haste
We
went
back
into
the
ballroom
She
walked
so
quickly
that
I
could
hardly
keep
up
with
her
She
stopped
at
a
column
Let
us
wait
here
she
whispered
You
are
looking
for
someone
I
began
But
she
paid
no
attention
to
me
her
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
the
crowd
Her
big
black
eyes
looked
yearningly
and
menacingly
from
under
the
black
velvet
I
turned
in
the
direction
of
her
eyes
and
understood
Along
the
corridor
formed
by
the
rows
of
columns
and
the
wall
he
the
man
I
had
met
with
her
in
the
copse
was
coming
I
knew
him
at
once
he
had
scarcely
changed
His
fair
moustache
curled
as
handsomely
his
brown
eyes
gleamed
with
the
same
calm
and
self-confident
gaiety
He
was
walking
with
out
haste
and
his
slender
figure
slightly
bent
was
telling
something
to
a
woman
in
a
domino
who
was
on
his
arm
As
he
reached
us
he
suddenly
raised
his
head
glanced
first
at
me
and
then
at
the
woman
with
whom
I
was
stand
ing
and
apparently
recognised
her
recognised
her
eyes
for
his
eyebrows
twitched
faintly
He
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
his
lips
curved
in
a
scarcely
perceptible
but
insufferably
insolent
sneer
He
bent
down
to
his
companion
whis
pered
a
couple
of
words
in
her
ear
she
at
once
looked
round
her
little
blue
eyes
hastily
scanned
us
both
and
softly
laughing
she
shook
her
lit
tle
hand
at
him
reprovingly
She
faintly
shrugged
one
shoulder
and
coquettishly
nestled
up
to
him
I
turned
round
to
my
unknown
lady
She
was
looking
after
the
retreating
couple
and
sud
THREE
MEETINGS
denly
withdrawing
her
hand
from
my
arm
rushed
towards
the
door
I
was
hastening
after
her
but
turning
round
she
glanced
at
me
in
such
a
way
that
I
made
her
a
deep
bow
and
stayed
where
I
was
I
felt
that
to
pursue
her
would
be
coarse
and
stupid
Please
tell
me
old
man
I
said
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
to
an
acquaintance
of
mine
who
was
a
living
directory
for
Petersburg
who
is
that
tall
handsome
man
with
mous
taches
That
one
He
's
a
foreigner
rather
an
enigmatic
creature
who
very
rarely
appears
on
our
horizon
Why
do
you
ask
Oh
nothing
I
went
home
Since
then
I
have
never
met
my
unknown
lady
Knowing
the
name
of
the
man
she
loved
I
could
no
doubt
have
found
out
who
she
was
but
I
did
not
want
to
I
have
said
already
That
this
woman
had
appeared
to
me
like
a
vision
and
like
a
vision
she
passed
by
and
vanished
for
ever
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
CHAPTER
I
In
a
rather
large
recently
whitewashed
room
in
the
manor-lodge
of
the
village
of
Sasovo
in
the
district
of
X
in
the
province
of
T
a
young
man
in
an
overcoat
was
sitting
on
a
narrow
wooden
chair
at
a
little
old
warped
table
looking
through
his
accounts
Two
can
dles
in
silver
travelling
candlesticks
were
burn
ing
before
him
on
a
bench
in
one
corner
stood
an
open
provision
basket
in
another
a
servant
was
putting
up
an
iron
bedstead
A
samovar
was
grumbling
and
hissing
behind
the
partition
wall
a
dog
was
turning
round
and
round
on
some
hay
that
had
just
been
brought
in
A
peasant
with
a
big
beard
and
an
intelligent
face
in
a
new
full
coat
tied
round
the
waist
with
a
red
scarf
apparently
the
village
elder
was
standing
in
the
doorway
intently
watching
the
young
man
at
the
table
A
very
old
diminu
tive
piano
stood
against
one
wall
beside
a
chest
of
drawers
as
ancient
with
holes
instead
of
locks
a
dark
looking-glass
was
visible
between
the
windows
on
the
partition
wall
hung
an
old
portrait
with
the
paint
peeling
off
the
canvas
representing
a
lady
in
a
farthingale
with
pow
dered
hair
and
a
black
ribbon
round
her
slen
der
neck
To
judge
from
the
perceptible
crookedness
of
the
ceiling
and
the
slope
of
the
floor
which
was
full
of
crevices
the
little
lodge
to
which
we
have
introduced
the
reader
had
existed
for
long
ages
no
one
was
permanently
living
in
it
it
served
for
the
landowner
on
his
visits
The
young
man
sitting
at
the
table
was
the
owner
of
the
village
of
Sasovo
He
had
arrived
only
the
evening
before
from
a
larger
estate
about
eighty
miles
away
and
was
intend
ing
to
go
away
the
next
day
after
inspecting
the
establishment
hearing
requests
from
the
peasants
and
verifying
all
the
business
records
That
's
enough
he
said
raising
his
head
I
am
tired
You
can
go
now
he
added
ad
dressing
the
village
elder
Come
early
to-mor
row
and
tell
the
peasants
in
the
morning
to
come
here
in
a
body
do
you
hear
l8
A
Oui
t
backwater
Yes
sir
And
tell
the
rural
clerk
to
bring
me
his
re
port
for
the
last
month
You
did
well
to
white
wash
the
walls
though
the
gentleman
added
looking
round
It
makes
it
look
cleaner
any
way
The
village
elder
too
looked
round
the
walls
without
speaking
Well
now
go
The
village
elder
bowed
and
went
out
The
gentleman
stretched
Hey
he
cried
bring
in
tea
it
's
bedtime
The
servant
went
into
the
other
room
and
soon
returned
with
a
glass
of
tea
a
string
of
shop-made
bread
rings
and
a
little
jug
of
cream
on
a
tray
The
young
man
began
upon
his
tea
but
had
not
sipped
his
glass
twice
when
there
was
the
sound
of
visitors
coming
into
the
ad
joining
room
and
a
squeaky
voice
asked
Is
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Astahov
at
home
Can
we
see
him
Vladimir
Sergeitch
this
was
the
name
of
the
young
man
in
the
overcoat
looked
at
his
servant
in
perplexity
and
said
in
a
hurried
whis
per
Go
and
find
out
who
it
is
The
tvvo
friends
and
other
stories
The
servant
went
out
carefully
closing
be
hind
him
the
door
which
did
not
shut
properly
Tell
Vladimir
Sergeitch
the
same
squeaky
voice
went
on
that
his
neighbour
Ipatov
wants
to
see
him
if
it
is
not
disturbing
him
and
that
another
neighbour
Ivan
Ilyitch
Bodry
akov
has
come
with
me
he
too
wishes
to
pay
his
respects
Vladimir
Sergeitch
made
an
involuntary
ges
ture
of
annoyance
When
the
servant
came
into
the
room
however
he
said
to
him
Ask
them
in
And
he
stood
up
in
expectation
of
his
visitors
The
door
opened
and
the
visitors
came
in
One
of
them
a
thick-set
grey-headed
old
gen
tleman
with
a
little
round
head
and
light-col
oured
eyes
led
the
way
the
other
a
tall
lean
man
of
thirty-five
with
a
long
swarthy
face
and
hair
in
disorder
followed
swaying
from
one
foot
to
the
other
The
old
gentleman
was
wearing
a
neat
grey
frock-coat
with
big
pearl
buttons
a
pink
cravat
half
hidden
by
the
turned-down
collar
of
his
white
shirt
was
loosely
swathed
round
his
neck
his
legs
were
adorned
with
gaiters
his
plaid
trousers
were
of
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
an
agreeable
check
and
altogether
he
made
an
agreeable
impression
His
companion
on
the
other
hand
produced
a
less
favourable
effect
on
the
spectator
he
wore
an
old
black
swallow
tail
coat
closely
buttoned
up
the
colour
of
his
thick
winter
trousers
was
in
keeping
with
his
coat
there
was
no
sign
of
linen
at
his
neck
or
his
wrists
The
old
man
first
went
up
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
and
bowing
politely
said
in
the
same
high
voice
I
have
the
honour
to
introduce
myself
your
nearest
neighbour
and
your
kinsman
indeed
Mihail
Nikolaitch
Ipatov
I
have
long
desired
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
I
hope
I
am
not
disturbing
you
Vladimir
Sergeitch
answered
that
he
was
de
lighted
and
that
he
too
desired
and
that
their
visit
was
not
disturbing
him
in
the
least
and
would
they
not
sit
down
and
have
tea
And
this
gentleman
continued
the
old
man
listening
with
a
cordial
smile
to
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
unfinished
sentences
and
indicating
the
gentleman
in
the
swallowtail
is
also
a
neighbour
of
yours
and
a
good
friend
of
mine
Ivan
Ilyitch
He
is
extremely
desirous
to
make
your
acquaintance
The
gentleman
in
the
swallowtail
from
whose
countenance
no
one
would
have
supposed
that
he
was
capable
of
being
extremely
desir
ous
of
anything
so
absent-minded
and
at
the
same
time
drowsy
was
its
expression
the
gen
tleman
in
the
swallowtail
bowed
listlessly
and
awkwardly
Vladimir
Sergeitch
bowed
in
re
sponse
to
him
and
again
begged
his
visitors
to
sit
down
They
did
so
I
am
delighted
the
old
man
began
with
an
agreeable
flourish
of
his
hands
while
his
com
panion
fell
to
gazing
at
the
ceiling
v/ith
his
mouth
a
little
open
delighted
to
have
the
hon
our
at
last
of
seeing
you
in
person
Although
you
reside
permanently
in
a
district
som.ewhat
remote
from
these
parts
yet
we
reckon
you
so
to
say
as
properly
belonging
to
our
neigh
bourhood
That
's
very
flattering
to
me
replied
Vladi
mir
Sergeitch
Whether
flattering
or
not
it
's
the
truth
You
must
excuse
me
Vladimir
Sergeitch
we
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
are
straightforward
people
here
in
the
X
dis
trict
plain
in
our
ways
we
say
what
we
think
without
beating
about
the
bush
Even
on
name
days
we
do
n't
put
on
dress-coats
to
visit
each
other
Really
That
is
the
established
custom
with
us
In
the
neighbouring
districts
they
call
us
'the
frock-coats
on
account
of
that
and
re
proach
us
with
it
as
lack
of
breeding
but
we
do
n't
pay
any
attention
to
that
Upon
my
word
to
live
in
the
country
and
stand
on
cere
mony
like
that
To
be
sure
what
can
be
better
in
the
coun
try
than
simplicity
of
manners
observed
Vladimir
Sergeitch
And
yet
the
old
gentleman
continued
in
our
district
too
there
are
most
intellectual
peo
ple
people
of
European
education
though
they
do
n't
wear
dress-coats
For
instance
there
is
our
historian
Stcpan
Stepanitch
Yevsyukov
he
is
studying
Russian
history
from
the
most
ancient
times
and
his
name
is
known
in
Peters
burg
a
very
learned
man
In
our
town
there
is
an
ancient
Swedish
cannon-ball
you
know
it
has
been
put
up
there
in
the
middle
of
the
square
it
was
he
discovered
it
you
know
Yes
indeed
Anton
Karlitch
Zenteler
now
he
has
studied
natural
history
though
indeed
they
say
all
Germans
succeed
in
that
subject
When
an
escaped
hyaena
was
killed
here
ten
years
ago
it
was
Anton
Karlitch
who
discovered
that
it
really
was
a
hysena
owing
to
the
peculiar
construction
of
its
tail
Then
there
's
Kaburdin
too
one
of
our
landowners
he
mostly
writes
light
articles
he
has
a
very
lively
pen
his
articles
come
out
in
the
Galatea
Bodryakov
not
Ivan
Ilyitch
no
Ivan
II
yitch
does
not
care
for
that
sort
of
thing
but
the
other
Bodryakov
Sergey
what
is
his
father
's
name
Ivan
Ilyitch
what
is
it
Sergeitch
Ivan
Ilyitch
prompted
him
Yes
Sergey
Sergeitch
his
hobby
is
poetry
Well
of
course
he
is
not
a
Pushkin
but
some
times
he
is
as
smart
as
any
Petersburg
fellow
Do
you
know
his
epigram
on
Agey
Fomitch
What
Agey
Fomitch
Ah
I
beg
your
pardon
I
am
always
for
getting
that
you
are
not
a
resident
here
after
all
He
is
our
Chief
of
Police
A
very
funny
epigram
it
was
Ivan
Ilyitch
you
remember
it
do
n't
you
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Agey
Fomitch
Bodryakov
began
indiffer
ently
He
's
honoured
in
our
Nobles
Hall
Not
without
reason
for
in
brief
I
must
tell
you
Ipatov
interposed
that
he
was
elected
almost
unanimously
for
he
is
a
most
worthy
man
He
's
honoured
in
our
Nobles
Hall
Not
without
reason
for
in
brief
He
eats
and
drinks
to
beat
us
all
So
surely
he
's
a
first-rate
Chief
Bodryakov
repeated
The
old
gentleman
laughed
He
he
he
that
's
not
bad
is
it
Ever
since
would
you
believe
it
all
of
us
when
we
say
for
instance
good-day
to
Agey
Fomitch
are
sure
to
add
'Surely
he
's
a
first-rate
Chief
1
And
do
you
imagine
that
Agey
Fomitch
is
vexed
at
it
Not
a
bit
No
that
is
not
the
way
with
us
Ask
Ivan
Ilyitch
here
Ivan
Ilyitch
merely
looked
away
Be
vexed
over
a
joke
how
could
one
Take
Ivan
Ilyitch
for
instance
his
nickname
among
us
is
the
Adjustable
Soul
because
he
very
readily
agrees
to
anything
Well
do
you
sup
pose
Ivan
Ilyitch
resents
it
Not
he
Ivan
Ilyitch
looked
slowly
blinking
first
at
the
old
gentleman
and
then
at
Vladimir
Sergeitch
The
nickname
of
the
Adjustable
Soul
cer
tainly
suited
Ivan
Ilyitch
There
was
not
a
trace
in
him
of
what
is
called
will
or
character
Anyone
could
take
him
wherever
he
chose
one
had
only
to
say
to
him
Ivan
Ilyitch
come
along
and
he
would
take
his
hat
and
come
but
if
someone
else
turned
up
and
said
Ivan
Ilyitch
do
n't
go
he
would
put
down
his
hat
and
stay
He
was
of
a
quiet
and
peace-loving
disposition
he
had
been
a
bachelor
all
his
life
he
did
not
play
cards
but
liked
sitting
by
the
players
and
gazing
into
their
faces
He
could
not
get
on
without
company
and
detested
soli
tude
he
sank
into
depression
when
alone
how
ever
that
happened
to
him
very
rarely
He
had
another
peculiarity
getting
up
early
in
the
morning
he
used
to
sing
in
a
subdued
voice
an
old
ballad
Once
upon
a
time
a
baron
Lived
a
simple
country
life
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Thanks
to
this
peculiarity
he
was
also
nick
named
the
hawfinch
it
is
well
known
that
a
caged
hawfinch
sings
only
once
in
the
day
in
the
early
morning
Such
was
Ivan
Ilyitch
Bodryakov
The
conversation
between
Vladimir
Sergeitch
and
Ipatov
lasted
a
good
time
but
did
not
again
take
such
an
intellectual
turn
The
old
man
questioned
Vladimir
Sergeitch
about
his
es
tate
about
his
forest
lands
and
other
holdings
about
the
improvements
he
had
made
or
was
intending
to
make
in
the
management
of
his
land
he
communicated
some
of
his
own
ob
servations
he
advised
him
among
other
things
as
a
means
of
getting
rid
of
tussocks
in
his
meadows
to
scatter
oats
round
them
which
would
induce
the
pigs
to
dig
them
up
with
their
snouts
and
so
on
At
last
however
ob
serving
that
Vladimir
Sergeitch
's
eyes
were
al
most
closing
and
that
even
his
speech
betrayed
a
certain
languor
and
incoherence
the
old
gen
tleman
got
up
and
bowing
affably
announced
that
he
did
not
intend
to
intrude
upon
him
any
longer
but
that
he
hoped
to
have
the
pleasure
of
welcoming
him
to
dinner
no
later
than
the
following
day
And
to
my
village
he
added
I
wo
n't
say
any
child
but
I
make
bold
to
say
any
hen
or
any
peasant
woman
you
come
across
would
show
you
the
way
you
have
only
to
ask
for
Ipatovka
The
horses
will
get
there
of
them
selves
Vladimir
Sergeitch
replied
with
some
slight
hesitation
which
was
characteristic
of
him
however
that
he
would
try
to
come
that
if
nothing
prevented
him
Oh
no
we
shall
expect
you
for
certain
the
old
gentleman
interrupted
him
genially
and
he
pressed
his
hand
warmly
and
rapidly
went
out
of
the
room
half
turning
in
the
doorway
to
exclaim
without
ceremony
The
Adjustable
Soul
Bodryakov
bowed
mutely
and
vanished
after
his
companion
stumbling
over
the
threshold
After
seeing
his
unexpected
visitors
out
Vladimir
Sergeitch
immediately
undressed
went
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Astahov
belonged
to
that
class
of
people
who
after
cautiously
testing
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
their
powers
in
two
or
three
different
careers
say
of
themselves
that
they
have
made
up
their
minds
to
look
at
life
from
a
practical
point
of
view
and
devote
their
leisure
to
increas
ing
their
income
He
was
by
no
means
stupid
somewhat
stingy
and
very
reasonable
was
fond
of
reading
of
society
of
music
but
all
in
moderation
and
he
behaved
with
the
utmost
propriety
He
was
only
twenty-seven
Young
men
like
him
have
become
numerous
of
late
He
was
of
medium
height
with
a
good
figure
his
features
were
pleasing
but
small
their
expression
scarcely
ever
changed
there
was
always
the
same
cool
clear
look
in
his
eyes
only
occasionally
softened
by
a
slight
shade
of
melancholy
or
boredom
a
polite
smile
al
ways
hovered
about
his
lips
He
had
splendid
hair
fair
silky
long
and
curly
Vladimir
Sergeitch
was
reckoned
to
have
about
six
hun
dred
serfs
on
good
land
and
he
had
thoughts
of
marrying
marrying
by
inclination
but
at
the
same
time
to
advantage
He
particularly
wanted
to
find
a
wife
with
good
connections
He
considered
that
he
needed
wider
connec
tions
In
fact
he
deserved
the
title
of
a
gen
tleman
a
word
which
has
lately
come
into
fashion
Getting
up
next
morning
as
usual
very
early
our
gentleman
set
to
work
and
did
his
busi
ness
rather
well
which
is
more
than
one
can
say
of
all
practical
young
men
among
us
in
Russia
He
listened
patiently
to
the
confused
complaints
and
requests
of
the
peasants
sat
isfied
them
as
far
as
he
could
went
into
the
quarrels
and
disputes
between
relations
talked
some
people
round
reproved
others
checked
the
rural
clerk
's
report
exposed
two
or
three
pieces
of
sharp
practice
on
the
part
of
the
village
elder
in
fact
he
settled
things
so
that
he
felt
satisfied
with
himself
and
the
peas
ants
as
they
went
home
spoke
well
of
him
In
spite
of
what
he
had
said
to
Ipatov
the
night
before
Vladimir
Sergeitch
made
up
his
mind
to
dine
at
home
and
had
even
ordered
his
travelling
cook
to
make
him
his
favourite
giblet
and
rice
soup
but
all
at
once
in
consequence
perhaps
of
the
satisfaction
which
he
had
been
feeling
since
the
morning
he
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
slapped
himself
on
the
forehead
and
with
a
certain
recklessness
exclaimed
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Suppose
I
do
go
to
that
lively
old
gossip
No
sooner
said
than
done
half
an
hour
later
he
was
sitting
in
his
new
chaise
drawn
by
four
good
peasant
horses
driving
to
Ipatovka
which
was
reckoned
a
distance
of
eight
miles
by
an
excellent
road
CHAPTER
II
MiHAiL
NiKOLAiTCH
IPATOV
had
two
houscs
facing
each
other
on
opposite
sides
of
a
huge
pond
A
long
dam
planted
with
silver
poplars
bordered
this
pond
almost
on
a
level
with
the
dam
could
be
seen
the
red
roof
of
a
water-mill
Built
exactly
alike
painted
the
same
lilac
col
our
the
little
houses
looked
as
though
they
were
glancing
at
one
another
with
the
shining
panes
of
their
clean
little
windows
across
the
broad
expanse
of
water
There
was
a
round
verandah
in
the
front
of
each
house
and
a
pointed
portico
rose
above
it
supported
by
four
closely
set
white
columns
There
was
an
old
park
all
round
the
pond
lime-trees
formed
ave
nues
across
it
and
stood
in
close
groups
about
it
ancient
pines
with
pale-yellow
trunks
dark
oaks
splendid
ash-trees
lifted
their
solitary
high
crests
here
and
there
the
dense
foliage
of
over
grown
lilacs
and
acacias
reached
the
very
walls
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
covering
all
but
the
front
of
each
house
from
which
winding
brick
paths
ran
down
the
slope
Bright
coloured
ducks
and
white
and
grey
geese
were
swimming
in
separate
flocks
over
the
shining
water
of
the
pond
it
was
never
covered
with
duckweed
thanks
to
the
numer
ous
springs
which
rose
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
rocky
ravine
at
its
head
The
position
of
the
houses
was
fine
inviting
secluded
and
beautiful
In
one
of
the
little
houses
lived
Mihail
Niko
laitch
himself
in
the
other
lived
his
mother
a
decrepit
old
lady
of
seventy
When
he
drove
on
to
the
dam
Vladimir
Sergeitch
did
not
know
to
which
house
to
go
He
looked
round
a
serf
boy
was
standing
barefoot
on
a
half-rotten
log
angling
Vladimir
Sergeitch
called
to
him
Whom
do
you
want
the
old
mistress
or
the
young
master
asked
the
boy
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
float
What
mistress
answered
Vladimir
Serge
itch
I
want
Mihail
Nikolaitch
Ah
the
young
master
Then
go
to
the
right
And
the
boy
pulled
up
his
line
and
rew
out
of
the
motionless
water
a
small
sil
very
carp
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
to
the
right
Mihail
Nikolaitch
was
playing
draughts
with
the
Adjustable
Soul
when
Vladimir
Sergeitch's
arrival
was
announced
He
was
extremely
de
lighted
jumped
up
from
his
easy-chair
ran
into
the
hall
and
in
the
hall
kissed
him
three
times
You
find
me
with
my
invariable
compan
ion
Vladimir
Sergeitch
said
the
talkative
old
gentleman
with
Ivan
Ilyitch
who
by
the
way
is
absolutely
enchanted
by
your
affability
Ivan
Ilyitch
looked
into
the
corner
and
said
noth
ing
He
has
been
kind
enough
to
stay
and
play
draughts
with
me
while
all
my
young
peo
ple
have
gone
into
the
park
but
I
will
send
for
them
at
once
But
why
trouble
them
Vladimir
Serge
itch
was
beginning
Oh
dear
it
is
no
trouble
whatever
Hey
Vanka
make
haste
and
run
after
the
young
ladies
tell
them
a
visitor
has
come
And
how
do
you
like
the
place
it
is
not
bad
is
it
Kaburdin
wrote
a
poem
about
it
'Ipatovka
lovely
haven
is
how
it
begins
the
rest
is
very
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
nice
too
only
I
do
n't
remember
it
The
park
is
too
large
that
is
the
only
pity
beyond
my
means
And
these
two
houses
so
alike
as
perhaps
you
have
noticed
were
built
by
two
brothers
my
father
Nikolay
and
my
Uncle
Sergey
they
laid
out
the
park
too
they
were
paragons
of
friendship
Damon
and
there
I
have
forgotten
the
name
of
the
other
Pythion
observed
Ivan
Ilyitch
Come
is
that
it
Well
it
does
not
mat
ter
At
home
the
old
gentleman
talked
in
a
much
more
free
and
easy
manner
As
you
are
I
daresay
aware
Vladimir
Sergeitch
I
am
a
widower
I
have
lost
my
wife
my
elder
children
are
at
boarding
school
I
have
only
the
two
younger
ones
with
me
and
my
sister-in
law
my
wife
's
sister
you
will
see
her
imme
diately
But
why
am
I
offering
you
nothing
Ivan
Ilyitch
go
and
see
about
refreshments
my
dear
fellow
What
sort
of
vodka
do
you
prefer
may
I
ask
I
never
drink
anything
before
dinner
Upon
my
word
is
it
possible
However
as
you
please
A
guest
must
be
honoured
and
must
not
be
crossed
We
are
plain
people
you
know
We
live
here
I
make
bold
to
say
not
in
barbarous
rusticity
but
in
peace
and
quiet
a
solitary
nook
that
's
what
it
is
But
why
do
n't
you
sit
down
Vladimir
Sergeitch
sat
down
still
holding
his
hat
Allow
me
to
relieve
you
said
Ipatov
and
with
punctilious
courtesy
taking
his
hat
away
from
him
he
put
it
in
the
corner
then
came
back
looked
into
his
guest
's
face
with
a
cor
dial
smile
and
not
knowing
what
agreeable
speech
to
make
to
him
asked
him
in
the
most
genial
way
whether
he
liked
draughts
I
play
all
games
very
badly
answered
