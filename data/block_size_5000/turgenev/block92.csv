me
steadily
straight
in
the
face
You
have
a
bad
opinion
of
me
to-day
she
said
frowning
I
a
bad
opinion
of
you
Why
is
it
you
are
both
so
low-spirited
Gagin
interrupted
me
would
you
like
me
to
play
a
waltz
as
I
did
yesterday
No
no
replied
Acia
and
she
clenched
her
hands
not
to-day
not
for
anything
I
m
not
going
to
force
you
to
don
t
excite
yourself
Not
for
anything
she
repeated
turning
pale
Can
it
be
she
s
in
love
with
me
I
thought
as
I
drew
near
the
dark
rushing
waters
of
the
Rhine
Can
it
be
that
she
loves
me
I
asked
myself
next
morning
directly
I
awoke
I
did
not
want
to
look
into
myself
I
felt
that
her
image
the
image
of
the
girl
with
the
affected
laugh
had
crept
close
into
my
heart
and
that
I
should
not
easily
get
rid
of
it
I
went
to
L
and
stayed
there
the
whole
day
but
I
saw
Acia
only
by
glimpses
She
was
not
well
she
had
a
headache
She
came
downstairs
for
a
minute
with
a
bandage
round
her
forehead
looking
white
and
thin
her
eyes
half-closed
With
a
faint
smile
she
said
It
will
soon
be
over
it
s
nothing
everything
s
soon
over
isn
t
it
and
went
away
I
felt
bored
and
as
it
were
listlessly
sad
yet
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
go
for
a
long
while
and
went
home
late
without
seeing
her
again
The
next
morning
passed
in
a
sort
of
half
slumber
of
the
consciousness
I
tried
to
set
to
work
and
could
not
I
tried
to
do
nothing
and
not
to
think
and
that
was
a
failure
too
I
strolled
about
the
town
returned
home
went
out
again
Are
you
Herr
N
I
heard
a
childish
voice
ask
suddenly
behind
me
I
looked
round
a
little
boy
was
standing
before
me
This
is
for
you
from
Fra
lein
Annette
he
said
handing
me
a
note
I
opened
it
and
recognised
the
irregular
rapid
handwriting
of
Acia
I
must
see
you
to-day
she
wrote
to
me
come
to-day
at
four
o
clock
to
the
stone
chapel
on
the
road
near
the
ruin
I
have
done
a
most
foolish
thing
to-day
Come
for
God
s
sake
you
shall
know
all
about
it
Tell
the
messenger
yes
Is
there
an
answer
the
boy
asked
me
Say
yes
I
replied
The
boy
ran
off
I
went
home
to
my
own
room
sat
down
and
sank
into
thought
My
heart
was
beating
violently
I
read
Acia
s
note
through
several
times
I
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
not
yet
twelve
o
clock
The
door
opened
Gagin
walked
in
His
face
was
overcast
He
seized
my
hand
and
pressed
it
warmly
He
seemed
very
much
agitated
What
is
the
matter
I
asked
Gagin
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
opposite
me
Three
days
ago
he
began
with
a
rather
forced
smile
and
hesitating
I
surprised
you
by
what
I
told
you
to-day
I
am
going
to
surprise
you
more
With
any
other
man
I
could
not
most
likely
bring
myself
so
directly
But
you
re
an
honourable
man
you
re
my
friend
aren
t
you
Listen
my
sister
Acia
is
in
love
with
you
I
trembled
all
over
and
stood
up
Your
sister
you
say
Yes
yes
Gagin
cut
me
short
I
tell
you
she
s
mad
and
she
ll
drive
me
mad
But
happily
she
can
t
tell
a
lie
and
she
confides
in
me
Ah
what
a
soul
there
is
in
that
little
girl
but
she
ll
be
her
own
ruin
that
s
certain
But
you
re
making
a
mistake
I
began
No
I
m
not
making
a
mistake
Yesterday
you
know
she
was
lying
down
almost
all
day
she
ate
nothing
but
she
did
not
complain
She
never
does
complain
I
was
not
anxious
though
towards
evening
she
was
in
a
slight
fever
At
two
o
clock
last
night
I
was
wakened
by
our
landlady
Go
to
your
sister
she
said
there
s
something
wrong
with
her
I
ran
in
to
Acia
and
found
her
not
undressed
feverish
and
in
tears
her
head
was
aching
her
teeth
were
chattering
What
s
the
matter
with
you
I
said
are
you
ill
She
threw
herself
on
my
neck
and
began
imploring
me
to
take
her
away
as
soon
as
possible
if
I
want
to
keep
her
alive
I
could
make
out
nothing
I
tried
to
soothe
her
Her
sobs
grew
more
violent
and
suddenly
through
her
sobs
I
made
out
well
in
fact
I
made
out
that
she
loves
you
I
assure
you
you
and
I
are
reasonable
people
and
we
can
t
imagine
how
deeply
she
feels
and
with
what
incredible
force
her
feelings
show
themselves
it
has
come
upon
her
as
unexpectedly
and
irresistibly
as
a
thunderstorm
You
re
a
very
nice
person
Gagin
pursued
but
why
she
s
so
in
love
with
you
I
confess
I
don
t
understand
She
says
she
has
been
drawn
to
you
from
the
first
moment
she
saw
you
That
s
why
she
cried
the
other
day
when
she
declared
she
would
never
love
any
one
but
me
She
imagines
you
despise
her
that
you
most
likely
know
about
her
birth
she
asked
me
if
I
hadn
t
told
you
her
story
I
said
of
course
that
I
hadn
t
but
her
intuition
s
simply
terrible
She
has
one
wish
to
get
away
to
get
away
at
once
I
sat
with
her
till
morning
she
made
me
promise
we
should
not
be
here
to-morrow
and
only
then
she
fell
asleep
I
have
been
thinking
and
thinking
and
at
last
I
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
you
To
my
mind
Acia
is
right
the
best
thing
is
for
us
both
to
go
away
from
here
And
I
should
have
taken
her
away
to-day
if
I
had
not
been
struck
by
an
idea
which
made
me
pause
Perhaps
who
knows
do
you
like
my
sister
If
so
what
s
the
object
of
my
taking
her
away
And
so
I
decided
to
cast
aside
all
reserve
Besides
I
noticed
something
myself
I
made
up
my
mind
to
find
out
from
you
Poor
Gagin
was
completely
out
of
countenance
Excuse
me
please
he
added
I
m
not
used
to
such
bothers
I
took
his
hand
You
want
to
know
I
pronounced
in
a
steady
voice
whether
I
like
your
sister
Yes
I
do
like
her
Gagin
glanced
at
me
But
he
said
faltering
you
d
hardly
marry
her
would
you
How
would
you
have
me
answer
such
a
question
Only
think
can
I
at
the
moment
I
know
I
know
Gagin
cut
me
short
I
have
no
right
to
expect
an
answer
from
you
and
my
question
was
the
very
acme
of
impropriety
But
what
am
I
to
do
One
can
t
play
with
fire
You
don
t
know
Acia
she
s
quite
capable
of
falling
ill
running
away
or
asking
you
to
see
her
alone
Any
other
girl
might
manage
to
hide
it
all
and
wait
but
not
she
It
is
the
first
time
with
her
that
s
the
worst
of
it
If
you
had
seen
how
she
sobbed
at
my
feet
to-day
you
would
understand
my
fears
I
was
pondering
Gagin
s
words
asking
you
to
see
her
alone
had
sent
a
twinge
to
my
heart
I
felt
it
was
shameful
not
to
meet
his
honest
frankness
with
frankness
Yes
I
said
at
last
you
are
right
An
hour
ago
I
got
a
note
from
your
sister
Here
it
is
Gagin
took
the
note
quickly
looked
it
through
and
let
his
hands
fall
on
his
knees
The
expression
of
perplexity
on
his
face
was
very
amusing
but
I
was
in
no
mood
for
laughter
I
tell
you
again
you
re
an
honourable
man
he
said
but
what
s
to
be
done
now
What
she
herself
wants
to
go
away
and
she
writes
to
you
and
blames
herself
for
acting
unwisely
and
when
had
she
time
to
write
this
What
does
she
wish
of
you
I
pacified
him
and
we
began
to
discuss
as
coolly
as
we
could
what
we
ought
to
do
The
conclusion
we
reached
at
last
was
that
to
avoid
worse
harm
befalling
I
was
to
go
and
meet
Acia
and
to
have
a
straightforward
explanation
with
her
Gagin
pledged
himself
to
stay
at
home
and
not
to
give
a
sign
of
knowing
about
her
note
to
me
in
the
evening
we
arranged
to
see
each
other
again
I
have
the
greatest
confidence
in
you
said
Gagin
and
he
pressed
my
hand
have
mercy
on
her
and
on
me
But
we
shall
go
away
to-morrow
anyway
he
added
getting
up
for
you
won
t
marry
Acia
I
see
Give
me
time
till
the
evening
I
objected
All
right
but
you
won
t
marry
her
He
went
away
and
I
threw
myself
on
the
sofa
and
shut
my
eyes
My
head
was
going
round
too
many
impressions
had
come
bursting
on
it
at
once
I
was
vexed
at
Gagin
s
frankness
I
was
vexed
with
Acia
her
love
delighted
and
disconcerted
me
I
could
not
comprehend
what
had
made
her
reveal
it
to
her
brother
the
absolute
necessity
of
rapid
almost
instantaneous
decision
exasperated
me
Marry
a
little
girl
of
seventeen
with
her
character
how
is
it
possible
I
said
getting
up
At
the
appointed
hour
I
crossed
the
Rhine
and
the
first
person
I
met
on
the
opposite
bank
was
the
very
boy
who
had
come
to
me
in
the
morning
He
was
obviously
waiting
for
me
From
Fra
lein
Annette
he
said
in
a
whisper
and
he
handed
me
another
note
Acia
informed
me
she
had
changed
the
place
of
our
meeting
I
was
to
go
in
an
hour
and
a
half
not
to
the
chapel
but
to
Frau
Luise
s
house
to
knock
below
and
go
up
to
the
third
storey
Is
it
yes
again
asked
the
boy
Yes
I
repeated
and
I
walked
along
the
bank
of
the
Rhine
There
was
not
time
to
go
home
I
didn
t
want
to
wander
about
the
streets
Beyond
the
town
wall
there
was
a
little
garden
with
a
skittle
ground
and
tables
for
beer
drinkers
I
went
in
there
A
few
middle-aged
Germans
were
playing
skittles
the
wooden
balls
rolled
along
with
a
sound
of
knocking
now
and
then
cries
of
approval
reached
me
A
pretty
waitress
with
her
eyes
swollen
with
weeping
brought
me
a
tankard
of
beer
I
glanced
at
her
face
She
turned
quickly
and
walked
away
Yes
yes
observed
a
fat
red-cheeked
citizen
sitting
by
our
Hannchen
is
dreadfully
upset
to-day
her
sweetheart
s
gone
for
a
soldier
I
looked
at
her
she
was
sitting
huddled
up
in
a
corner
her
face
propped
on
her
hand
tears
were
rolling
one
by
one
between
her
fingers
Some
one
called
for
beer
she
took
him
a
pot
and
went
back
to
her
place
Her
grief
affected
me
I
began
musing
on
the
interview
awaiting
me
but
my
dreams
were
anxious
cheerless
dreams
It
was
with
no
light
heart
I
was
going
to
this
interview
I
had
no
prospect
before
me
of
giving
myself
up
to
the
bliss
of
love
returned
what
lay
before
me
was
to
keep
my
word
to
do
a
difficult
duty
One
can
t
play
with
her
These
words
of
Gagin
s
had
gone
through
my
heart
like
arrows
And
three
days
ago
in
that
boat
borne
along
by
the
current
had
I
not
been
pining
with
the
thirst
for
happiness
It
had
become
possible
and
I
was
hesitating
I
was
pushing
it
away
I
was
bound
to
push
it
from
me
its
suddenness
bewildered
me
Acia
herself
with
her
fiery
temperament
her
past
her
bringing-up
this
fascinating
strange
creature
I
confess
she
frightened
me
My
feelings
were
long
struggling
within
me
The
appointed
hour
was
drawing
near
I
can
t
marry
her
I
decided
at
last
she
shall
not
know
I
love
her
I
got
up
and
putting
a
thaler
in
the
hand
of
poor
Hannchen
she
did
not
even
thank
me
I
directed
my
steps
towards
Frau
Luise
s
The
air
was
already
overcast
with
the
shadows
of
evening
and
the
narrow
strip
of
sky
above
the
dark
street
was
red
with
the
glow
of
sunset
I
knocked
faintly
at
the
door
it
was
opened
at
once
I
stepped
through
the
doorway
and
found
myself
in
complete
darkness
This
way
I
heard
an
old
woman
s
voice
You
re
expected
I
took
two
steps
groping
my
way
a
long
hand
took
mine
Is
that
you
Frau
Luise
I
asked
Yes
answered
the
same
voice
Tis
I
my
fine
young
man
The
old
woman
led
me
up
a
steep
staircase
and
stopped
on
the
third
floor
In
the
feeble
light
from
a
tiny
window
I
saw
the
wrinkled
visage
of
the
burgomaster
s
widow
A
crafty
smile
of
mawkish
sweetness
contorted
her
sunken
lips
and
pursed
up
her
dim-sighted
eyes
She
pointed
me
to
a
little
door
with
an
abrupt
movement
I
opened
it
and
slammed
it
behind
me
In
the
little
room
into
which
I
stepped
it
was
rather
dark
and
I
did
not
at
once
see
Acia
Wrapped
in
a
big
shawl
she
was
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
window
turning
away
from
me
and
almost
hiding
her
head
like
a
frightened
bird
She
was
breathing
quickly
and
trembling
all
over
I
felt
unutterably
sorry
for
her
I
went
up
to
her
She
averted
her
head
still
more
Anna
Nikolaevna
I
said
She
suddenly
drew
herself
up
tried
to
look
at
me
and
could
not
I
took
her
hand
it
was
cold
and
lay
like
a
dead
thing
in
mine
I
wished
Acia
began
trying
to
smile
but
unable
to
control
her
pale
lips
I
wanted
No
I
can
t
she
said
and
ceased
Her
voice
broke
at
every
word
I
sat
down
beside
her
Anna
Nikolaevna
I
repeated
and
I
too
could
say
nothing
more
A
silence
followed
I
still
held
her
hand
and
looked
at
her
She
sat
as
before
shrinking
together
breathing
with
difficulty
and
stealthily
biting
her
lower
lip
to
keep
back
the
rising
tears
I
looked
at
her
there
was
something
touchingly
helpless
in
her
timid
passivity
it
seemed
as
though
she
had
been
so
exhausted
she
had
hardly
reached
the
chair
and
had
simply
fallen
on
it
My
heart
began
to
melt
Acia
I
said
hardly
audibly
She
slowly
lifted
her
eyes
to
me
Oh
the
eyes
of
a
woman
who
loves
who
can
describe
them
They
were
supplicating
those
eyes
they
were
confiding
questioning
surrendering
I
could
not
resist
their
fascination
A
subtle
flame
passed
all
through
me
with
tingling
shocks
I
bent
down
and
pressed
my
lips
to
her
hand
I
heard
a
quivering
sound
like
a
broken
sigh
and
I
felt
on
my
hair
the
touch
of
a
feeble
hand
shaking
like
a
leaf
I
raised
my
head
and
looked
at
her
face
How
transformed
it
was
all
of
a
sudden
The
expression
of
terror
had
vanished
from
it
her
eyes
looked
far
away
and
drew
me
after
them
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
her
forehead
was
white
as
marble
and
her
curls
floated
back
as
though
the
wind
had
stirred
them
I
forgot
everything
I
drew
her
to
me
her
hand
yielded
unresistingly
her
whole
body
followed
her
hand
the
shawl
fell
from
her
shoulders
and
her
head
lay
softly
on
my
breast
lay
under
my
burning
lips
Yours
she
murmured
hardly
above
a
breath
My
arms
were
slipping
round
her
waist
But
suddenly
the
thought
of
Gagin
flashed
like
lightning
before
me
What
are
we
doing
I
cried
abruptly
moving
back
Your
brother
why
he
knows
everything
He
knows
I
am
with
you
Acia
sank
back
on
her
chair
Yes
I
went
on
getting
up
and
walking
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
Your
brother
knows
all
about
it
I
had
to
tell
him
You
had
to
she
articulated
thickly
She
could
not
it
seemed
recover
herself
and
hardly
understood
me
Yes
yes
I
repeated
with
a
sort
of
exasperation
and
it
s
all
your
fault
your
fault
What
did
you
betray
your
secret
for
Who
forced
you
to
tell
your
brother
He
has
been
with
me
to-day
and
told
me
what
you
said
to
him
I
tried
not
to
look
at
Acia
and
kept
walking
with
long
strides
up
and
down
the
room
Now
everything
is
over
everything
Acia
tried
to
get
up
from
her
chair
Stay
I
cried
stay
I
implore
you
You
have
to
do
with
an
honourable
man
yes
an
honourable
man
But
in
Heaven
s
name
what
upset
you
Did
you
notice
any
change
in
me
But
I
could
not
hide
my
feelings
from
your
brother
when
he
came
to
me
to-day
Why
am
I
talking
like
this
I
was
thinking
inwardly
and
the
idea
that
I
was
an
immoral
liar
that
Gagin
knew
of
our
interview
that
everything
was
spoilt
exposed
seemed
buzzing
persistently
in
my
head
I
didn
t
call
my
brother
I
heard
a
frightened
whisper
from
Acia
he
came
of
himself
See
what
you
have
done
I
persisted
Now
you
want
to
go
away
Yes
I
must
go
away
she
murmured
in
the
same
soft
voice
I
only
asked
you
to
come
here
to
say
good-bye
And
do
you
suppose
I
retorted
it
will
be
easy
for
me
to
part
with
you
But
what
did
you
tell
my
brother
for
Acia
said
in
perplexity
I
tell
you
I
could
not
do
otherwise
If
you
had
not
yourself
betrayed
yourself
I
locked
myself
in
my
room
she
answered
simply
I
did
not
know
the
landlady
had
another
key
This
innocent
apology
on
her
lips
at
such
a
moment
almost
infuriated
me
at
the
time
and
now
I
can
not
think
of
it
without
emotion
Poor
honest
truthful
child
And
now
everything
s
at
an
end
I
began
again
everything
Now
we
shall
have
to
part
I
stole
a
look
at
Acia
Her
face
had
quickly
flushed
crimson
She
was
I
felt
it
both
ashamed
and
afraid
I
went
on
walking
and
talking
as
though
in
delirium
You
did
not
let
the
feeling
develop
which
had
begun
to
grow
you
have
broken
off
our
relations
yourself
you
had
no
confidence
in
me
you
doubted
me
While
I
was
talking
Acia
bent
more
and
more
forward
and
suddenly
slid
on
her
knees
dropped
her
head
on
her
arms
and
began
sobbing
I
ran
up
to
her
and
tried
to
lift
her
up
but
she
would
not
let
me
I
can
t
bear
women
s
tears
at
the
sight
of
them
I
am
at
my
wits
end
at
once
Anna
Nikolaevna
Acia
I
kept
repeating
please
I
implore
you
for
God
s
sake
stop
I
took
her
hand
again
But
to
my
immense
astonishment
she
suddenly
jumped
up
rushed
with
lightning
swiftness
to
the
door
and
vanished
When
a
few
minutes
later
Frau
Luise
came
into
the
room
I
was
still
standing
in
the
very
middle
of
it
as
it
were
thunderstruck
I
could
not
believe
this
interview
could
possibly
have
come
to
such
a
quick
such
a
stupid
end
when
I
had
not
said
a
hundredth
part
of
what
I
wanted
to
say
and
what
I
ought
to
have
said
when
I
did
not
know
myself
in
what
way
it
would
be
concluded
Is
Fra
lein
gone
Frau
Luise
asked
me
raising
her
yellow
eyebrows
right
up
to
her
false
front
I
stared
at
her
like
a
fool
and
went
away
I
made
my
way
out
of
the
town
and
struck
out
straight
into
the
open
country
I
was
devoured
by
anger
frenzied
anger
I
hurled
reproaches
at
myself
How
was
it
I
had
not
seen
the
reason
that
had
forced
Acia
to
change
the
place
of
our
meeting
how
was
it
I
did
not
appreciate
what
it
must
have
cost
her
to
go
to
that
old
woman
how
was
it
I
had
not
kept
her
Alone
with
her
in
that
dim
half-dark
room
I
had
had
the
force
I
had
had
the
heart
to
repulse
her
even
to
reproach
her
Now
her
image
simply
pursued
me
I
begged
her
forgiveness
The
thought
of
that
pale
face
those
wet
and
timid
eyes
of
her
loose
hair
falling
on
the
drooping
neck
the
light
touch
of
her
head
against
my
breast
maddened
me
Yours
I
heard
her
whisper
I
acted
from
conscientious
motives
I
assured
myself
Not
true
Did
I
really
desire
such
a
termination
Was
I
capable
of
parting
from
her
Could
I
really
do
without
her
Madman
madman
I
repeated
with
exasperation
Meanwhile
night
was
coming
on
I
walked
with
long
strides
towards
the
house
where
Acia
lived
Gagin
came
out
to
meet
me
Have
you
seen
my
sister
he
shouted
to
me
while
I
was
still
some
distance
off
Why
isn
t
she
at
home
I
asked
No
She
hasn
t
come
back
No
I
was
in
fault
Gagin
went
on
I
couldn
t
restrain
myself
Contrary
to
our
agreement
I
went
to
the
chapel
she
was
not
there
didn
t
she
come
then
She
hasn
t
been
at
the
chapel
And
you
haven
t
seen
her
I
was
obliged
to
admit
I
had
seen
her
Where
At
Frau
Luise
s
I
parted
from
her
an
hour
ago
I
added
I
felt
sure
she
had
come
home
We
will
wait
a
little
said
Gagin
We
went
into
the
house
and
sat
down
near
each
other
We
were
silent
We
both
felt
very
uncomfortable
We
were
continually
looking
round
staring
at
the
door
listening
At
last
Gagin
got
up
Oh
this
is
beyond
anything
he
cried
My
heart
s
in
my
mouth
She
ll
be
the
death
of
me
by
God
Let
s
go
and
look
for
her
We
went
out
It
was
quite
dark
by
now
outside
What
did
you
talk
about
to
her
Gagin
asked
me
as
he
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
I
only
saw
her
for
five
minutes
I
answered
I
talked
to
her
as
we
agreed
Do
you
know
what
he
replied
it
s
better
for
us
to
separate
In
that
way
we
are
more
likely
to
come
across
her
before
long
In
any
case
come
back
here
within
an
hour
I
went
hurriedly
down
from
the
vineyard
and
rushed
into
the
town
I
walked
rapidly
through
all
the
streets
looked
in
all
directions
even
at
Frau
Luise
s
windows
went
back
to
the
Rhine
and
ran
along
the
bank
From
time
to
time
I
was
met
by
women
s
figures
but
Acia
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
There
was
no
anger
gnawing
at
my
heart
now
I
was
tortured
by
a
secret
terror
and
it
was
not
only
terror
that
I
felt
no
I
felt
remorse
the
most
intense
regret
and
love
yes
the
tenderest
love
I
wrung
my
hands
I
called
Acia
through
the
falling
darkness
of
the
night
first
in
a
low
voice
then
louder
and
louder
I
repeated
a
hundred
times
over
that
I
loved
her
I
vowed
I
would
never
part
from
her
I
would
have
given
everything
in
the
world
to
hold
her
cold
hand
again
to
hear
again
her
soft
voice
to
see
her
again
before
me
She
had
been
so
near
she
had
come
to
me
her
mind
perfectly
made
up
in
perfect
innocence
of
heart
and
feelings
she
had
offered
me
her
unsullied
youth
and
I
had
not
folded
her
to
my
breast
I
had
robbed
myself
of
the
bliss
of
watching
her
sweet
face
blossom
with
delight
and
the
peace
of
rapture
This
thought
drove
me
out
of
my
mind
Where
can
she
have
gone
What
can
she
have
done
with
herself
I
cried
in
an
agony
of
helpless
despair
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
white
on
the
very
edge
of
the
river
I
knew
the
place
there
stood
there
over
the
tomb
of
a
man
who
had
been
drowned
seventy
years
ago
a
stone
cross
half-buried
in
the
ground
bearing
an
old
inscription
My
heart
sank
I
ran
up
to
the
cross
the
white
figure
vanished
I
shouted
Acia
I
felt
frightened
myself
by
my
uncanny
voice
but
no
one
called
back
I
resolved
to
go
and
see
whether
Gagin
had
found
her
As
I
climbed
swiftly
up
the
vineyard
path
I
caught
sight
of
a
light
in
Acia
s
room
This
reassured
me
a
little
I
went
up
to
the
house
The
door
below
was
fastened
I
knocked
A
window
on
the
ground
floor
was
cautiously
opened
and
Gagin
s
head
appeared
Have
you
found
her
I
asked
She
has
come
back
he
answered
in
a
whisper
She
is
in
her
own
room
undressing
Everything
is
all
right
Thank
God
I
cried
in
an
indescribable
rush
of
joy
Thank
God
now
everything
is
right
But
you
know
we
must
have
another
talk
Another
time
he
replied
softly
drawing
the
casement
towards
him
Another
time
but
now
good-bye
Till
to-morrow
I
said
To-morrow
everything
shall
be
arranged
Good-bye
repeated
Gagin
The
window
was
closed
I
was
on
the
point
of
knocking
at
the
window
I
was
on
the
point
of
telling
Gagin
there
and
then
that
I
wanted
to
ask
him
for
his
sister
s
hand
But
such
a
proposal
at
such
a
time
To-morrow
I
reflected
to-morrow
I
shall
be
happy
To-morrow
I
shall
be
happy
Happiness
has
no
to-morrow
no
yesterday
it
thinks
not
on
the
past
and
dreams
not
of
the
future
it
has
the
present
not
a
day
even
a
moment
I
don
t
remember
how
I
got
to
Z
It
was
not
my
legs
that
carried
me
nor
a
boat
that
ferried
me
across
I
felt
that
I
was
borne
along
by
great
mighty
wings
I
passed
a
bush
where
a
nightingale
was
singing
I
stopped
and
listened
long
I
fancied
it
sang
my
love
and
happiness
When
next
morning
I
began
to
approach
the
little
house
I
knew
so
well
I
was
struck
with
one
circumstance
all
the
windows
in
it
were
open
and
the
door
too
stood
open
some
bits
of
paper
were
lying
about
in
front
of
the
doorway
a
maidservant
appeared
with
a
broom
at
the
door
I
went
up
to
her
They
are
gone
she
bawled
before
I
had
time
to
inquire
whether
Gagin
was
at
home
Gone
I
repeated
What
do
you
mean
by
gone
Where
They
went
away
this
morning
at
six
o
clock
and
didn
t
say
where
Wait
a
minute
I
believe
you
re
Mr
N
aren
t
you
I
m
Mr
N
yes
The
mistress
has
a
letter
for
you
The
maid
went
upstairs
and
returned
with
a
letter
Here
it
is
if
you
please
sir
But
it
s
impossible
how
can
it
be
I
was
beginning
The
servant
stared
blankly
at
me
and
began
sweeping
I
opened
the
letter
Gagin
had
written
it
there
was
not
one
word
from
Acia
He
began
with
begging
me
not
to
be
angry
at
his
sudden
departure
he
felt
sure
that
on
mature
consideration
I
should
approve
of
his
decision
He
could
find
no
other
way
out
of
a
position
which
might
become
difficult
and
dangerous
Yesterday
evening
he
wrote
while
we
were
both
waiting
in
silence
for
Acia
I
realised
conclusively
the
necessity
of
separation
There
are
prejudices
I
respect
I
can
understand
that
it
s
impossible
for
you
to
marry
Acia
She
has
told
me
everything
for
the
sake
of
her
peace
of
mind
I
was
bound
to
yield
to
her
reiterated
urgent
entreaties
At
the
end
of
the
letter
he
expressed
his
regret
that
our
acquaintance
had
come
to
such
a
speedy
termination
wished
me
every
happiness
shook
my
hand
in
friendship
and
besought
me
not
to
try
to
seek
them
out
What
prejudices
I
cried
aloud
as
though
he
could
hear
me
what
rubbish
What
right
has
he
to
snatch
her
from
me
I
clutched
at
my
head
The
servant
began
loudly
calling
for
her
mistress
her
alarm
forced
me
to
control
myself
One
idea
was
aflame
within
me
to
find
them
to
find
them
wherever
they
might
be
To
accept
this
blow
to
resign
myself
to
such
a
calamity
was
impossible
I
learnt
from
the
landlady
that
they
had
got
on
to
a
steamer
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
were
going
down
the
Rhine
I
went
to
the
ticket-office
there
I
was
told
they
had
taken
tickets
for
Cologne
I
was
going
home
to
pack
up
at
once
and
follow
them
I
happened
to
pass
the
house
of
Frau
Luise
Suddenly
I
heard
some
one
calling
me
I
raised
my
head
and
at
the
window
of
the
very
room
where
I
had
met
Acia
the
day
before
I
saw
the
burgomaster
s
widow
She
smiled
her
loathsome
smile
and
called
me
I
turned
away
and
was
going
on
but
she
called
after
me
that
she
had
something
for
me
These
words
brought
me
to
a
halt
and
I
went
into
her
house
How
can
I
describe
my
feelings
when
I
saw
that
room
again
By
rights
began
the
old
woman
showing
me
a
little
note
I
oughtn
t
to
have
given
you
this
unless
you
d
come
to
me
of
your
own
accord
but
you
are
such
a
fine
young
man
Take
it
I
took
the
note
On
a
tiny
scrap
of
paper
stood
the
following
words
hurriedly
scribbled
in
pencil
Good-bye
we
shall
not
see
each
other
again
It
is
not
through
pride
that
I
m
going
away
no
I
can
t
help
it
Yesterday
when
I
was
crying
before
you
if
you
had
said
one
word
to
me
only
one
word
I
should
have
stayed
You
did
not
say
it
It
seems
it
is
better
so
Good-bye
for
ever
One
word
Oh
madman
