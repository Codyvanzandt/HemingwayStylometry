is
broken
off
I
observed
and
noticed
the
same
moment
that
there
was
no
sign
of
bait-tin
nor
worms
near
Martin
Petrovitch
And
what
sort
of
fishing
could
there
be
in
September
Broken
off
he
said
and
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
But
it
s
all
the
same
He
dropped
the
rod
in
again
Natalia
Nikolaevna
s
son
he
asked
me
after
the
lapse
of
two
minutes
during
which
I
had
been
gazing
at
him
with
secret
bewilderment
Though
he
had
grown
terribly
thinner
still
he
seemed
a
giant
But
what
rags
he
was
dressed
in
and
how
utterly
he
had
gone
to
pieces
altogether
Yes
I
answered
I
m
the
son
of
Natalia
Nikolaevna
B
Is
she
well
My
mother
is
quite
well
She
was
very
much
hurt
at
your
refusal
I
added
she
did
not
at
all
expect
you
would
not
wish
to
come
and
see
her
Martin
Petrovitch
s
head
sank
on
his
breast
Have
you
been
there
he
asked
with
a
motion
of
his
head
Where
There
at
the
house
Haven
t
you
Go
What
is
there
for
you
to
do
here
Go
It
s
useless
talking
to
me
I
don
t
like
it
He
was
silent
for
a
while
You
d
like
to
be
always
idling
about
with
a
gun
In
my
young
days
I
used
to
be
inclined
the
same
way
too
Only
my
father
was
strict
and
made
me
respect
him
too
Mind
you
very
different
from
fathers
nowadays
My
father
flogged
me
with
a
horsewhip
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
I
d
to
give
up
idling
about
And
so
I
respected
him
Oo
Yes
Harlov
paused
again
Don
t
you
stop
here
he
began
again
You
go
along
to
the
house
Things
are
managed
there
now
it
s
first-rate
Volodka
Here
he
faltered
for
a
second
Our
Volodka
s
a
good
hand
at
everything
He
s
a
fine
fellow
yes
indeed
and
a
fine
scoundrel
too
I
did
not
know
what
to
say
Martin
Petrovitch
spoke
very
tranquilly
And
you
go
and
see
my
daughters
You
remember
I
daresay
I
had
daughters
They
re
managers
too
clever
ones
But
I
m
growing
old
my
lad
I
m
on
the
shelf
Time
to
repose
you
know
Nice
sort
of
repose
I
thought
glancing
round
Martin
Petrovitch
I
uttered
aloud
you
really
must
come
and
see
us
Harlov
looked
at
me
Go
along
my
lad
I
tell
you
Don
t
hurt
mamma
s
feelings
come
and
see
us
Go
away
my
lad
go
away
persisted
Harlov
What
do
you
want
to
talk
to
me
for
If
you
have
no
carriage
mamma
will
send
you
hers
Go
along
But
really
and
truly
Martin
Petrovitch
Harlov
looked
down
again
and
I
fancied
that
his
cheeks
dingy
as
though
covered
with
earth
faintly
flushed
Really
do
come
I
went
on
What
s
the
use
of
your
sitting
here
of
your
making
yourself
miserable
Making
myself
miserable
he
commented
hesitatingly
Yes
to
be
sure
making
yourself
miserable
I
repeated
Harlov
said
nothing
and
seemed
lost
in
musing
Emboldened
by
his
silence
I
determined
to
be
open
to
act
straightforwardly
bluntly
Do
not
forget
I
was
only
fifteen
then
Martin
Petrovitch
I
began
seating
myself
beside
him
I
know
everything
you
see
positively
everything
I
know
how
your
son-in-law
is
treating
you
doubtless
with
the
consent
of
your
daughters
And
now
you
are
in
such
a
position
But
why
lose
heart
Harlov
still
remained
silent
and
simply
dropped
in
his
line
while
I
what
a
sensible
fellow
what
a
sage
I
felt
Doubtless
I
began
again
you
acted
imprudently
in
giving
up
everything
to
your
daughters
It
was
most
generous
on
your
part
and
I
am
not
going
to
blame
you
In
our
days
it
is
a
quality
only
too
rare
But
since
your
daughters
are
so
ungrateful
you
ought
to
show
a
contempt
yes
a
contempt
for
them
and
not
fret
Stop
muttered
Harlov
suddenly
gnashing
his
teeth
and
his
eyes
staring
at
the
pond
glittered
wrathfully
Go
away
But
Martin
Petrovitch
Go
away
I
tell
you
or
I
ll
kill
you
I
had
come
quite
close
to
him
but
at
the
last
words
I
instinctively
jumped
up
What
did
you
say
Martin
Petrovitch
I
ll
kill
you
I
tell
you
go
away
With
a
wild
moan
a
roar
the
words
broke
from
Harlov
s
breast
but
he
did
not
turn
his
head
and
still
stared
wrathfully
straight
in
front
of
him
I
ll
take
you
and
fling
you
and
your
fool
s
counsel
into
the
water
You
shall
learn
to
pester
the
old
little
milksop
He
s
gone
mad
flashed
through
my
mind
I
looked
at
him
more
attentively
and
was
completely
petrified
Martin
Petrovitch
was
weeping
Tear
after
tear
rolled
from
his
eyelashes
down
his
cheeks
while
his
face
had
assumed
an
expression
utterly
savage
Go
away
he
roared
once
more
or
I
ll
kill
you
by
God
for
an
example
to
others
He
was
shaking
all
over
from
side
to
side
and
showing
his
teeth
like
a
wild
boar
I
snatched
up
my
gun
and
took
to
my
heels
My
dog
flew
after
me
barking
He
too
was
frightened
When
I
got
home
I
naturally
did
not
by
so
much
as
a
word
to
my
mother
hint
at
what
I
had
seen
but
coming
across
Souvenir
I
told
him
the
devil
knows
why
all
about
it
That
loathsome
person
was
so
delighted
at
my
story
shrieking
with
laughter
and
even
dancing
with
pleasure
that
I
could
hardly
forbear
striking
him
Ah
I
should
like
he
kept
repeating
breathless
with
laughter
to
see
that
fiend
the
Swede
Harlov
crawling
into
the
mud
and
sitting
in
it
Go
over
to
the
pond
if
you
re
so
curious
Yes
but
how
if
he
kills
me
I
felt
horribly
sick
at
Souvenir
and
regretted
my
ill-timed
confidence
Zhitkov
to
whom
he
repeated
my
tale
looked
at
the
matter
somewhat
differently
We
shall
have
to
call
in
the
police
he
concluded
or
may
be
we
may
have
to
send
for
a
battalion
of
military
His
forebodings
with
regard
to
the
military
battalion
did
not
come
true
but
something
extraordinary
really
did
happen
In
the
middle
of
October
three
weeks
after
my
interview
with
Martin
Petrovitch
I
was
standing
at
the
window
of
my
own
room
in
the
second
storey
of
our
house
and
thinking
of
nothing
at
all
I
looked
disconsolately
into
the
yard
and
the
road
that
lay
beyond
it
The
weather
had
been
disgusting
for
the
last
five
days
Shooting
was
not
even
to
be
thought
of
All
things
living
had
hidden
themselves
even
the
sparrows
made
no
sound
and
the
rooks
had
long
ago
disappeared
from
sight
The
wind
howled
drearily
then
whistled
spasmodically
The
low-hanging
sky
unbroken
by
one
streak
of
light
had
changed
from
an
unpleasant
whitish
to
a
leaden
and
still
more
sinister
hue
and
the
rain
which
had
been
pouring
and
pouring
mercilessly
and
unceasingly
had
suddenly
become
still
more
violent
and
more
driving
and
streamed
with
a
rushing
sound
over
the
panes
The
trees
had
been
stripped
utterly
bare
and
turned
a
sort
of
grey
It
seemed
they
had
nothing
left
to
plunder
yet
the
wind
would
not
be
denied
but
set
to
harassing
them
once
more
Puddles
clogged
with
dead
leaves
stood
everywhere
Big
bubbles
continually
bursting
and
rising
up
again
leaped
and
glided
over
them
Along
the
roads
the
mud
lay
thick
and
impassable
The
cold
pierced
its
way
indoors
through
one
s
clothes
to
the
very
bones
An
involuntary
shiver
passed
over
the
body
and
how
sick
one
felt
at
heart
Sick
precisely
not
sad
It
seemed
there
would
never
again
in
the
world
be
sunshine
nor
brightness
nor
colour
but
this
rain
and
mire
and
grey
damp
and
raw
fog
would
last
for
ever
and
for
ever
would
the
wind
whine
and
moan
Well
I
was
standing
moodily
at
my
window
and
I
remember
a
sudden
darkness
came
on
a
bluish
darkness
though
the
clock
only
pointed
to
twelve
Suddenly
I
fancied
I
saw
a
bear
dash
across
our
yard
from
the
gates
to
the
steps
Not
on
all-fours
certainly
but
as
he
is
depicted
when
he
gets
up
on
his
hind-paws
I
could
not
believe
my
eyes
If
it
were
not
a
bear
I
had
seen
it
was
any
way
something
enormous
black
shaggy
I
was
still
lost
in
wonder
as
to
what
it
could
be
when
suddenly
I
heard
below
a
furious
knocking
It
seemed
something
utterly
unlooked
for
something
terrible
was
stumbling
headlong
into
our
house
Then
began
a
commotion
a
hurrying
to
and
fro
I
quickly
went
down
the
stairs
ran
into
the
dining-room
At
the
drawing-room
door
facing
me
stood
my
mother
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
Behind
her
peered
several
scared
female
faces
The
butler
two
footmen
and
a
page
with
his
mouth
wide
open
with
astonishment
were
packed
together
in
the
doorway
of
the
hall
In
the
middle
of
the
dining-room
covered
with
mire
dishevelled
tattered
and
soaking
wet
so
wet
that
steam
rose
all
round
and
water
was
running
in
little
streams
over
the
floor
knelt
shaking
ponderously
as
it
were
at
the
last
gasp
the
very
monster
I
had
seen
dashing
across
the
yard
And
who
was
this
monster
Harlov
I
came
up
on
one
side
and
saw
not
his
face
but
his
head
which
he
was
clutching
with
both
hands
in
the
hair
that
blinded
him
with
filth
He
was
breathing
heavily
brokenly
something
positively
rattled
in
his
throat
and
in
all
the
bespattered
dark
mass
the
only
thing
that
could
be
clearly
distinguished
was
the
tiny
whites
of
the
eyes
straying
wildly
about
He
was
awful
The
dignitary
came
into
my
mind
whom
he
had
once
crushed
for
comparing
him
to
a
mastodon
Truly
so
might
have
looked
some
antediluvian
creature
that
had
just
escaped
another
more
powerful
monster
attacking
it
in
the
eternal
slime
of
the
primeval
swamps
Martin
Petrovitch
my
mother
cried
at
last
and
she
clasped
her
hands
Is
that
you
Good
God
Merciful
heavens
I
I
we
heard
a
broken
voice
which
seemed
with
effort
and
painfully
to
dwell
on
each
sound
Alas
It
is
I
But
what
has
happened
to
you
Mercy
upon
us
Natalia
Nikolaev
na
I
have
run
straight
to
you
from
home
on
foot
Through
such
mud
But
you
don
t
look
like
a
man
Get
up
sit
down
anyway
And
you
she
turned
to
the
maid-servants
run
quick
for
cloths
And
haven
t
you
some
dry
clothes
she
asked
the
butler
The
butler
gesticulated
as
though
to
say
Is
it
likely
for
such
a
size
But
we
could
get
a
coverlet
he
replied
or
there
s
a
new
horse-rug
But
get
up
get
up
Martin
Petrovitch
sit
down
repeated
my
mother
They
ve
turned
me
out
madam
Harlov
moaned
suddenly
and
he
flung
his
head
back
and
stretched
his
hands
out
before
him
They
ve
turned
me
out
Natalia
Nikolaevna
My
own
daughters
out
of
my
own
home
My
mother
sighed
and
groaned
What
are
you
saying
Turned
you
out
What
wickedness
what
wickedness
She
crossed
herself
But
do
get
up
Martin
Petrovitch
I
beg
you
Two
maid-servants
came
in
with
cloths
and
stood
still
before
Harlov
It
was
clear
they
did
not
know
how
to
attack
this
mountain
of
filth
They
have
turned
me
out
madam
they
have
turned
me
out
Harlov
kept
repeating
meanwhile
The
butler
returned
with
a
large
woollen
coverlet
and
he
too
stood
still
in
perplexity
Souvenir
s
little
head
was
thrust
in
at
a
door
and
vanished
again
Martin
Petrovitch
get
up
Sit
down
and
tell
me
everything
properly
my
mother
commanded
in
a
tone
of
determination
Harlov
rose
The
butler
tried
to
assist
him
but
only
dirtied
his
hand
and
shaking
his
fingers
retreated
to
the
door
Staggering
and
faltering
Harlov
got
to
a
chair
and
sat
down
The
maids
again
approached
him
with
their
cloths
but
he
waved
them
off
with
his
hand
and
refused
the
coverlet
My
mother
did
not
herself
indeed
insist
to
dry
Harlov
was
obviously
out
of
the
question
they
contented
themselves
with
hastily
wiping
up
his
traces
on
the
floor
How
have
they
turned
you
out
my
mother
asked
as
soon
as
he
had
a
little
time
to
recover
himself
Madam
Natalia
Nikolaevna
he
began
in
a
strained
voice
and
again
I
was
struck
by
the
uneasy
straying
of
his
eyes
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
I
am
myself
most
of
all
to
blame
Ay
to
be
sure
you
would
not
listen
to
me
at
the
time
assented
my
mother
sinking
into
an
arm-chair
and
slightly
moving
a
scented
handkerchief
before
her
nose
very
strong
was
the
smell
that
came
from
Harlov
the
odour
in
a
forest
bog
is
not
so
strong
Alas
that
s
not
where
I
erred
madam
but
through
pride
Pride
has
been
my
ruin
as
it
ruined
the
Tsar
Navuhodonosor
I
fancied
God
had
given
me
my
full
share
of
sense
and
if
I
resolved
on
anything
it
followed
it
was
right
so
and
then
the
fear
of
death
came
I
was
utterly
confounded
I
ll
show
said
I
to
the
last
my
power
and
my
strength
I
ll
bestow
all
on
them
and
they
must
feel
it
all
their
lives
Harlov
suddenly
was
shaking
all
over
Like
a
mangy
dog
they
have
driven
me
out
of
the
house
This
is
their
gratitude
In
what
way
my
mother
was
beginning
They
took
my
page
Maximka
from
me
Harlov
interrupted
her
his
eyes
were
still
wandering
he
held
both
hands
the
fingers
interlaced
under
his
chin
my
carriage
they
took
away
my
monthly
allowance
they
cut
down
did
not
pay
me
the
sum
specified
cut
me
short
all
round
in
fact
still
I
said
nothing
bore
it
all
And
I
bore
it
by
reason
alas
of
my
pride
again
That
my
cruel
enemies
might
not
say
See
the
old
fool
s
sorry
for
it
now
and
you
too
do
you
remember
madam
had
warned
me
mind
you
it
s
all
to
no
purpose
you
said
and
so
I
bore
it
Only
to-day
I
came
into
my
room
and
it
was
occupied
already
and
my
bed
they
d
thrown
out
into
the
lumber-room
You
can
sleep
there
we
put
up
with
you
there
even
only
out
of
charity
we
ve
need
of
your
room
for
the
household
And
this
was
said
to
me
by
whom
Volodka
Sletkin
the
vile
hound
the
base
cur
Harlov
s
voice
broke
But
your
daughters
What
did
they
do
asked
my
mother
But
I
bore
it
all
Harlov
went
on
again
bitterness
bitterness
was
in
my
heart
let
me
tell
you
and
shame
I
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
the
light
of
day
That
was
why
I
was
unwilling
to
come
and
see
you
ma
am
from
this
same
feeling
from
shame
for
my
disgrace
I
have
tried
everything
my
good
friend
kindness
affection
and
threats
and
I
reasoned
with
them
and
more
besides
I
bowed
down
before
them
like
this
Harlov
showed
how
he
had
bowed
down
And
all
in
vain
And
all
of
it
I
bore
At
the
beginning
at
first
I
d
very
different
thoughts
I
ll
up
I
thought
and
kill
them
I
ll
crush
them
all
so
that
not
a
trace
remains
of
them
I
ll
let
them
know
Well
but
after
I
submitted
It
s
a
cross
I
thought
laid
upon
me
it
s
to
bid
me
make
ready
for
death
And
all
at
once
to-day
driven
out
like
a
cur
And
by
whom
Volodka
And
you
asked
about
my
daughters
they
ve
no
will
of
their
own
at
all
They
re
Volodka
s
slaves
Yes
My
mother
wondered
In
Anna
s
case
I
can
understand
that
she
s
a
wife
But
how
comes
it
your
second
Evlampia
She
s
worse
than
Anna
She
s
altogether
given
herself
up
into
Volodka
s
hands
That
s
the
reason
she
refused
your
soldier
too
At
his
at
Volodka
s
bidding
Anna
to
be
sure
ought
to
resent
it
and
she
can
t
bear
her
sister
but
she
submits
He
s
bewitched
them
the
cursed
scoundrel
Though
she
Anna
I
daresay
is
pleased
to
think
that
Evlampia
who
was
always
so
proud
and
now
see
what
she
s
come
to
O
alas
alas
God
my
God
My
mother
looked
uneasily
towards
me
I
moved
a
little
away
as
a
precautionary
measure
for
fear
I
should
be
sent
away
altogether
I
am
very
sorry
indeed
Martin
Petrovitch
she
began
that
my
former
prot
g
has
caused
you
so
much
sorrow
and
has
turned
out
so
badly
But
I
too
was
mistaken
in
him
Who
could
have
expected
this
of
him
Madam
Harlov
moaned
out
and
he
struck
himself
a
blow
on
the
chest
I
can
not
bear
the
ingratitude
of
my
daughters
I
can
not
madam
You
know
I
gave
them
everything
everything
And
besides
my
conscience
has
been
tormenting
me
Many
things
alas
many
things
I
have
thought
over
sitting
by
the
pond
fishing
If
you
d
only
done
good
to
any
one
in
your
life
was
what
I
pondered
upon
succoured
the
poor
set
the
peasants
free
or
something
to
atone
for
having
wrung
their
lives
out
of
them
You
must
answer
for
them
before
God
Now
their
tears
are
revenged
And
what
sort
of
life
have
they
now
It
was
a
deep
pit
even
in
my
time
why
disguise
my
sins
but
now
there
s
no
seeing
the
bottom
All
these
sins
I
have
taken
upon
my
soul
I
have
sacrificed
my
conscience
for
my
children
and
for
this
I
m
laughed
to
scorn
Kicked
out
of
the
house
like
a
cur
Don
t
think
about
that
Martin
Petrovitch
observed
my
mother
And
when
he
told
me
your
Volodka
Harlov
went
on
with
fresh
force
when
he
told
me
I
was
not
to
live
in
my
room
any
more
I
laid
every
plank
in
that
room
with
my
own
hands
when
he
said
that
to
me
God
only
knows
what
passed
within
me
It
was
all
confusion
in
my
head
and
like
a
knife
in
my
heart
Either
to
cut
his
throat
or
get
away
out
of
the
house
So
I
have
run
to
you
my
benefactress
Natalia
Nikolaevna
where
had
I
to
lay
my
head
And
then
the
rain
the
filth
I
fell
down
twenty
times
maybe
And
now
in
such
unseemly
Harlov
scanned
himself
and
moved
restlessly
in
his
chair
as
though
intending
to
get
up
Say
no
more
Martin
Petrovitch
my
mother
interposed
hurriedly
what
does
that
signify
That
you
ve
made
the
floor
dirty
That
s
no
great
matter
Come
I
want
to
make
you
a
proposition
Listen
They
shall
take
you
now
to
a
special
room
and
make
you
up
a
clean
bed
you
undress
wash
and
lie
down
and
sleep
a
little
Natalia
Nikolaevna
There
s
no
sleeping
for
me
Harlov
responded
drearily
It
s
as
though
there
were
hammers
beating
in
my
brain
Me
like
some
good-for-nothing
beast
Lie
down
and
sleep
my
mother
repeated
insistently
And
then
we
ll
give
you
some
tea
yes
and
we
ll
have
a
talk
Don
t
lose
heart
old
friend
If
they
ve
driven
you
out
of
your
house
in
my
house
you
will
always
find
a
home
I
have
not
forgotten
you
know
that
you
saved
my
life
Benefactress
moaned
Harlov
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
You
must
save
me
now
This
appeal
touched
my
mother
almost
to
tears
I
am
ready
and
eager
to
help
you
Martin
Petrovitch
in
everything
I
am
able
But
you
must
promise
me
that
you
will
listen
to
me
in
future
and
dismiss
every
evil
thought
from
you
Harlov
took
his
hands
from
his
face
If
need
be
he
said
I
can
forgive
them
even
My
mother
nodded
her
head
approvingly
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
in
such
a
truly
Christian
frame
of
mind
Martin
Petrovitch
but
we
will
talk
of
that
later
Meanwhile
you
put
yourself
to
rights
and
most
of
all
sleep
Take
Martin
Petrovitch
to
what
was
the
master
s
room
the
green
room
said
my
mother
addressing
the
butler
and
whatever
he
asks
for
let
him
have
it
on
the
spot
Give
orders
for
his
clothes
to
be
dried
and
washed
and
ask
the
housekeeper
for
what
linen
is
needed
Do
you
hear
Yes
madam
responded
the
butler
And
as
soon
as
he
s
asleep
tell
the
tailor
to
take
his
measure
and
his
beard
will
have
to
be
shaved
Not
at
once
but
after
Yes
madam
repeated
the
butler
Martin
Petrovitch
kindly
come
Harlov
got
up
looked
at
my
mother
was
about
to
go
up
to
her
but
stopped
swinging
a
bow
from
the
waist
crossed
himself
three
times
to
the
image
and
followed
the
steward
Behind
him
I
too
slipped
out
of
the
room
The
butler
conducted
Harlov
to
the
green
room
and
at
once
ran
off
for
the
wardroom
maid
as
it
turned
out
there
were
no
sheets
on
the
bed
Souvenir
who
met
us
in
the
passage
and
popped
into
the
green
room
with
us
promptly
proceeded
to
dance
grinning
and
chuckling
round
Harlov
who
stood
his
arms
held
a
little
away
from
him
and
his
legs
apart
in
the
middle
of
the
room
seeming
lost
in
thought
The
water
was
still
dripping
from
him
The
Swede
The
Swede
Harlus
piped
Souvenir
doubling
up
and
holding
his
sides
Mighty
founder
of
the
illustrious
race
of
Harlovs
look
down
on
thy
descendant
What
does
he
look
like
Dost
thou
recognise
him
Ha
ha
ha
Your
excellency
your
hand
I
beg
why
have
you
got
on
black
gloves
I
tried
to
restrain
Souvenir
to
put
him
to
shame
but
it
was
too
late
for
that
now
He
called
me
parasite
toady
You
ve
no
roof
said
he
to
call
your
own
But
now
no
doubt
about
it
he
s
become
as
dependent
as
poor
little
me
Martin
Petrovitch
and
Souvenir
the
poor
toady
are
equal
now
He
ll
have
to
live
on
charity
too
They
ll
toss
him
the
stale
and
dirty
crust
that
the
dog
has
sniffed
at
and
refused
And
they
ll
tell
him
to
eat
it
too
Ha
ha
ha
Harlov
still
stood
motionless
his
head
drawn
in
his
legs
and
arms
held
a
little
apart
Martin
Harlov
a
nobleman
born
Souvenir
went
on
shrieking
What
airs
he
used
to
give
himself
Just
look
at
me
Don
t
come
near
or
I
ll
knock
you
down
And
when
he
was
so
clever
as
to
give
away
and
divide
his
property
didn
t
he
crow
Gratitude
he
cackled
gratitude
But
why
were
you
so
mean
to
me
Why
didn
t
you
make
me
a
present
May
be
I
should
have
felt
it
more
And
you
see
I
was
right
when
I
said
they
d
strip
you
bare
and
Souvenir
I
screamed
but
Souvenir
was
in
nowise
daunted
Harlov
still
did
not
stir
It
seemed
as
though
he
were
only
now
beginning
to
be
aware
how
soaking
wet
everything
was
that
he
had
on
and
was
waiting
to
be
helped
off
with
his
clothes
But
the
butler
had
not
come
back
And
a
military
man
too
Souvenir
began
again
In
the
year
twelve
he
saved
his
country
he
showed
proofs
of
his
valour
I
see
how
it
is
Stripping
the
frozen
marauders
of
their
breeches
is
work
he
s
quite
equal
to
but
when
the
hussies
stamp
their
feet
at
him
he
s
frightened
out
of
his
skin
Souvenir
I
screamed
a
second
time
Harlov
looked
askance
at
Souvenir
Till
that
instant
he
seemed
not
to
have
noticed
his
presence
and
only
my
exclamation
aroused
his
attention
Look
out
brother
he
growled
huskily
don
t
dance
yourself
into
trouble
Souvenir
fairly
rolled
about
with
laughter
Ah
how
you
frighten
me
most
honoured
brother
You
re
a
formidable
person
to
be
sure
You
must
comb
your
hair
at
any
rate
or
God
forbid
it
ll
get
dry
and
you
ll
never
wash
it
clean
again
you
ll
have
to
mow
it
with
a
sickle
Souvenir
all
of
a
sudden
got
into
a
fury
And
you
give
yourself
airs
still
A
poor
outcast
and
he
gives
himself
airs
Where
s
your
home
now
you
d
better
tell
me
that
you
were
always
boasting
of
it
I
have
a
home
of
my
own
he
used
to
say
but
you
re
homeless
My
ancestral
roof
he
would
say
Souvenir
pounced
on
this
phrase
as
an
inspiration
Mr
Bitchkov
I
protested
What
are
you
about
you
forget
yourself
But
he
still
persisted
in
chattering
and
still
danced
and
pranced
up
and
down
quite
close
to
Harlov
And
still
the
butler
and
the
wardroom
maid
did
not
come
I
felt
alarmed
I
began
to
notice
that
Harlov
who
had
during
his
conversation
with
my
mother
gradually
grown
quieter
and
even
towards
the
end
apparently
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
was
beginning
to
get
worked
up
again
He
breathed
more
hurriedly
it
seemed
as
though
his
face
were
suddenly
swollen
under
his
ears
his
fingers
twitched
his
eyes
again
began
moving
restlessly
in
the
dark
mask
of
his
grim
face
Souvenir
Souvenir
I
cried
Stop
it
I
ll
tell
mamma
But
Souvenir
seemed
possessed
by
frenzy
Yes
yes
most
honoured
brother
he
began
again
here
we
find
ourselves
you
and
I
in
the
most
delicate
position
While
your
daughters
with
your
son-in-law
Vladimir
Vassilievitch
are
having
a
fine
laugh
at
you
under
your
roof
And
you
should
at
least
curse
them
as
you
promised
Even
that
you
re
not
equal
to
To
be
sure
how
could
you
hold
your
own
with
Vladimir
Vassilievitch
Why
you
used
to
call
him
Volodka
too
You
call
him
Volodka
He
is
Vladimir
Vassilievitch
Mr
Sletkin
a
landowner
a
gentleman
while
what
are
you
pray
A
furious
roar
drowned
Souvenir
s
words
Harlov
was
aroused
His
fists
were
clenched
and
lifted
his
face
was
purple
there
was
foam
on
his
drawn
lips
he
was
shaking
with
rage
Roof
you
say
he
thundered
in
his
iron
voice
curse
you
say
No
I
will
not
curse
them
They
don
t
care
for
that
But
the
roof
I
will
tear
the
roof
off
them
and
they
shall
have
no
roof
over
their
heads
like
me
They
shall
learn
to
know
Martin
Harlov
My
strength
is
not
all
gone
yet
they
shall
learn
to
laugh
at
me
They
shall
have
no
roof
over
their
heads
I
was
stupefied
never
in
my
life
had
I
witnessed
such
boundless
anger
Not
a
man
a
wild
beast
paced
to
and
fro
before
me
I
was
stupefied
as
for
Souvenir
he
had
hidden
under
the
table
in
his
fright
They
shall
not
Harlov
shouted
for
the
last
time
and
almost
knocking
over
the
butler
and
the
wardroom
maid
he
rushed
away
out
of
the
house
He
dashed
headlong
across
the
yard
and
vanished
through
the
gates
My
mother
was
terribly
angry
when
the
butler
came
with
an
abashed
countenance
to
report
Martin
Petrovitch
s
sudden
and
unexpected
retreat
He
did
not
dare
to
conceal
the
cause
of
this
retreat
I
was
obliged
to
confirm
his
story
Then
it
was
all
your
doing
my
mother
cried
at
the
sight
of
Souvenir
who
had
run
in
like
a
hare
and
was
even
approaching
to
kiss
her
hand
Your
vile
tongue
is
to
blame
for
it
all
Excuse
me
d
rectly
d
rectly
faltered
Souvenir
stuttering
and
drawing
back
his
elbows
behind
him
D
rectly
d
rectly
I
know
your
d
rectly
my
mother
repeated
reprovingly
and
she
sent
him
out
of
the
room
Then
she
rang
the
bell
sent
for
Kvitsinsky
and
gave
him
orders
to
set
off
on
the
spot
to
Eskovo
with
a
carriage
to
find
Martin
Petrovitch
at
all
costs
and
to
bring
him
back
Do
not
let
me
see
you
without
him
she
concluded
The
gloomy
Pole
bowed
his
head
without
a
word
and
went
away
I
went
back
to
my
own
room
sat
down
again
at
the
window
and
I
pondered
a
long
while
I
remember
on
what
had
taken
place
before
my
eyes
I
was
puzzled
I
could
not
understand
how
it
was
that
Harlov
who
had
endured
the
insults
of
his
own
family
almost
without
a
murmur
had
lost
all
self-control
and
been
unable
to
put
up
with
the
jeers
and
pin-pricks
of
such
an
abject
creature
as
Souvenir
I
did
not
understand
in
those
days
what
insufferable
bitterness
there
may
sometimes
be
in
a
foolish
taunt
even
when
it
comes
from
lips
one
scorns
The
hated
name
of
Sletkin
uttered
by
Souvenir
had
been
like
a
spark
thrown
into
powder
The
sore
spot
could
not
endure
this
final
prick
About
an
hour
passed
by
Our
coach
drove
into
the
yard
but
our
steward
sat
in
it
alone
And
my
mother
had
said
to
him
don
t
let
me
see
you
without
him
Kvitsinsky
jumped
hurriedly
out
of
the
carriage
and
ran
up
the
steps
His
face
had
a
perturbed
look
something
very
unusual
with
him
I
promptly
rushed
downstairs
and
followed
at
his
heels
into
the
drawing-room
Well
have
you
brought
him
asked
my
mother
I
have
not
brought
him
answered
Kvitsinsky
and
I
could
not
bring
him
How
s
that
Have
you
seen
him
Yes
What
has
happened
to
him
A
fit
No
nothing
has
happened
How
is
it
you
didn
t
bring
him
He
s
pulling
his
house
to
pieces
What
He
s
standing
on
the
roof
of
the
new
building
and
pulling
it
to
pieces
Forty
boards
or
more
I
should
guess
must
have
come
down
by
now
and
some
five
of
the
rafters
too
They
shall
not
have
a
roof
over
their
heads
Harlov
s
words
came
back
to
me
My
mother
stared
at
Kvitsinsky
Alone
he
s
standing
on
the
roof
and
