him
to
understand
that
Elena
had
been
deeply
distressed
and
that
now
she
was
calmer
Elena
too
did
not
write
to
Insarov
she
had
a
plan
in
her
head
One
day
Bersenyev
had
just
informed
her
with
a
cheerful
face
that
the
doctor
had
already
allowed
Insarov
to
eat
a
cutlet
and
that
he
would
probably
soon
go
out
she
seemed
absorbed
dropped
her
eyes
Guess
what
I
want
to
say
to
you
she
said
Bersenyev
was
confused
He
understood
her
I
suppose
he
answered
looking
away
you
want
to
say
that
you
wish
to
see
him
Elena
crimsoned
and
scarcely
audibly
she
breathed
Yes
Well
what
then
That
I
imagine
you
can
easily
do
Ugh
he
thought
what
a
loath-some
feeling
there
is
in
my
heart
You
mean
that
I
have
already
before
said
Elena
But
I
am
afraid
now
he
is
you
say
seldom
alone
That
s
not
difficult
to
get
over
replied
Bersenyev
still
not
looking
at
her
I
of
course
can
not
prepare
him
but
give
me
a
note
Who
can
hinder
your
writing
to
him
as
a
good
friend
in
whom
you
take
an
interest
There
s
no
harm
in
that
Appoint
I
mean
write
to
him
when
you
will
come
I
am
ashamed
whispered
Elena
Give
me
the
note
I
will
take
it
There
s
no
need
of
that
but
I
wanted
to
ask
you
don
t
be
angry
with
me
Andrei
Petrovitch
don
t
go
to
him
to-morrow
Bersenyev
bit
his
lip
Ah
yes
I
understand
very
well
very
well
and
adding
two
or
three
words
more
he
quickly
took
leave
So
much
the
better
so
much
the
better
he
thought
as
he
hurried
home
I
have
learnt
nothing
new
but
so
much
the
better
What
possessed
me
to
go
hanging
on
to
the
edge
of
another
man
s
happiness
I
regret
nothing
I
have
done
what
my
conscience
told
me
but
now
it
is
over
Let
them
be
My
father
was
right
when
he
used
to
say
to
me
You
and
I
my
dear
boy
are
not
Sybarites
we
are
not
aristocrats
we
re
not
the
spoilt
darlings
of
fortune
and
nature
we
are
not
even
martyrs
we
are
workmen
and
nothing
more
Put
on
your
leather
apron
workman
and
take
your
place
at
your
workman
s
bench
in
your
dark
workshop
and
let
the
sun
shine
on
other
men
Even
our
dull
life
has
its
own
pride
its
own
happiness
The
next
morning
Insarov
got
a
brief
note
by
the
post
Expect
me
Elena
wrote
to
him
and
give
orders
for
no
one
to
see
you
A
P
will
not
come
Insarov
read
Elena
s
note
and
at
once
began
to
set
his
room
to
rights
asked
his
landlady
to
take
away
the
medicine-glasses
took
off
his
dressing-gown
and
put
on
his
coat
His
head
was
swimming
and
his
heart
throbbing
from
weakness
and
delight
His
knees
were
shaking
he
dropped
on
to
the
sofa
and
began
to
look
at
his
watch
It
s
now
a
quarter
to
twelve
he
said
to
himself
She
can
never
come
before
twelve
I
will
think
of
something
else
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
I
shall
break
down
altogether
Before
twelve
she
can
not
possibly
come
The
door
was
opened
and
in
a
light
silk
gown
all
pale
all
fresh
young
and
joyful
Elena
came
in
and
with
a
faint
cry
of
delight
she
fell
on
his
breast
You
are
alive
you
are
mine
she
repeated
embracing
and
stroking
his
head
He
was
almost
swooning
breathless
at
such
closeness
such
caresses
such
bliss
She
sat
down
near
him
holding
him
fast
and
began
to
gaze
at
him
with
that
smiling
and
caressing
and
tender
look
only
to
be
seen
shining
in
the
eyes
of
a
loving
woman
Her
face
suddenly
clouded
over
How
thin
you
have
grown
my
poor
Dmitri
she
said
passing
her
hand
over
his
neck
what
a
beard
you
have
And
you
have
grown
thin
my
poor
Elena
he
answered
catching
her
fingers
with
his
lips
She
shook
her
curls
gaily
That
s
nothing
You
shall
see
how
soon
we
ll
be
strong
again
The
storm
has
blown
over
just
as
it
blew
over
and
passed
away
that
day
when
we
met
in
the
chapel
Now
we
are
going
to
live
He
answered
her
with
a
smile
only
Ah
what
a
time
we
have
had
Dmitri
what
a
cruel
time
How
can
people
outlive
those
they
love
I
knew
beforehand
what
Andrei
Petrovitch
would
say
to
me
every
day
I
did
really
my
life
seemed
to
ebb
and
flow
with
yours
Welcome
back
my
Dmitri
He
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
her
He
was
longing
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
Another
thing
I
observed
she
went
on
pushing
back
his
hair
I
made
so
many
observations
all
this
time
in
my
leisure
when
any
one
is
very
very
miserable
with
what
stupid
attention
he
follows
everything
that
s
going
on
about
him
I
really
sometimes
lost
myself
in
gazing
at
a
fly
and
all
the
while
such
chill
and
terror
in
my
heart
But
that
s
all
past
all
past
isn
t
it
Everything
s
bright
in
the
future
isn
t
it
You
are
for
me
in
the
future
answered
Insarov
so
it
is
bright
for
me
And
for
me
too
But
do
you
remember
when
I
was
here
not
the
last
time
no
not
the
last
time
she
repeated
with
an
involuntary
shudder
when
we
were
talking
I
spoke
of
death
I
don
t
know
why
I
never
suspected
then
that
it
was
keeping
watch
on
us
But
you
are
well
now
aren
t
you
I
m
much
better
I
m
nearly
well
You
are
well
you
are
not
dead
Oh
how
happy
I
am
A
short
silence
followed
Elena
said
Insarov
Well
my
dearest
Tell
me
did
it
never
occur
to
you
that
this
illness
was
sent
us
as
a
punishment
Elena
looked
seriously
at
him
That
idea
did
come
into
my
head
Dmitri
But
I
thought
what
am
I
to
be
punished
for
What
duty
have
I
transgressed
against
whom
have
I
sinned
Perhaps
my
conscience
is
not
like
other
people
s
but
it
was
silent
or
perhaps
I
am
guilty
towards
you
I
hinder
you
I
stop
you
You
don
t
stop
me
Elena
we
will
go
together
Yes
Dmitri
let
us
go
together
I
will
follow
you
That
is
my
duty
I
love
you
I
know
no
other
duty
O
Elena
said
Insarov
what
chains
every
word
of
yours
fastens
on
me
Why
talk
of
chains
she
interposed
We
are
free
people
you
and
I
Yes
she
went
on
looking
musingly
on
the
floor
while
with
one
hand
she
still
stroked
his
hair
I
experienced
much
lately
of
which
I
had
never
had
any
idea
If
any
one
had
told
me
beforehand
that
I
a
young
lady
well
brought
up
should
go
out
from
home
alone
on
all
sorts
of
made-up
excuses
and
to
go
where
to
a
young
man
s
lodgings
how
indignant
I
should
have
been
And
that
has
all
come
about
and
I
feel
no
indignation
whatever
Really
she
added
and
turned
to
Insarov
He
looked
at
her
with
such
an
expression
of
adoration
that
she
softly
dropped
her
hand
from
his
hair
over
his
eyes
Dmitri
she
began
again
you
don
t
know
of
course
I
saw
you
there
in
that
dreadful
bed
I
saw
you
in
the
clutches
of
death
unconscious
You
saw
me
Yes
He
was
silent
for
a
little
And
Bersenyev
was
here
She
nodded
Insarov
bowed
down
before
her
O
Elena
he
whispered
I
don
t
dare
to
look
at
you
Why
Andrei
Petrovitch
is
so
good
I
was
not
ashamed
before
him
And
what
have
I
to
be
ashamed
of
I
am
ready
to
tell
all
the
world
that
I
am
yours
And
Andrei
Petrovitch
I
trust
like
a
brother
He
saved
me
cried
Insarov
He
is
the
noblest
kindest
of
men
Yes
And
do
you
know
I
owe
everything
to
him
Do
you
know
that
it
was
he
who
first
told
me
that
you
loved
me
And
if
I
could
tell
you
everything
Yes
he
is
a
noble
man
Insarov
looked
steadily
at
Elena
He
is
in
love
with
you
isn
t
he
Elena
dropped
her
eyes
He
did
love
me
she
said
in
an
undertone
Insarov
pressed
her
hand
warmly
Oh
you
Russians
he
said
you
have
hearts
of
pure
gold
And
he
he
has
been
waiting
on
me
he
has
not
slept
at
night
And
you
you
my
angel
No
reproaches
no
hesitations
and
all
this
for
me
for
me
Yes
yes
all
for
you
because
they
love
you
Ah
Dmitri
How
strange
it
is
I
think
I
have
talked
to
you
of
it
before
but
it
doesn
t
matter
I
like
to
repeat
it
and
you
will
like
to
hear
it
When
I
saw
you
the
first
time
Why
are
there
tears
in
your
eyes
Insarov
interrupted
her
Tears
Are
there
She
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
Oh
what
a
silly
boy
He
doesn
t
know
yet
that
people
weep
from
happiness
I
wanted
to
tell
you
when
I
saw
you
the
first
time
I
saw
nothing
special
in
you
really
I
remember
Shubin
struck
me
much
more
at
first
though
I
never
loved
him
and
as
for
Andrei
Petrovitch
oh
there
was
a
moment
when
I
thought
isn
t
this
he
And
with
you
there
was
nothing
of
that
sort
but
afterwards
afterwards
you
took
my
heart
by
storm
Have
pity
on
me
began
Insarov
He
tried
to
get
up
but
dropped
down
on
to
the
sofa
again
at
once
What
s
the
matter
with
you
inquired
Elena
anxiously
Nothing
I
am
still
rather
weak
I
am
not
strong
enough
yet
for
such
happiness
Then
sit
quietly
Don
t
dare
to
move
don
t
get
excited
she
added
threatening
him
with
her
finger
And
why
have
you
left
off
your
dressing-gown
It
s
too
soon
to
begin
to
be
a
dandy
Sit
down
and
I
will
tell
you
stories
Listen
and
be
quiet
To
talk
much
is
bad
for
you
after
your
illness
She
began
to
talk
to
him
about
Shubin
about
Kurnatovsky
and
what
she
had
been
doing
for
the
last
fortnight
of
how
war
seemed
judging
from
the
newspapers
inevitable
and
so
directly
he
was
perfectly
well
again
he
must
without
losing
a
minute
make
arrangements
for
them
to
start
All
this
she
told
him
sitting
beside
him
leaning
on
his
shoulder
He
listened
to
her
listened
turning
pale
and
red
Sometimes
he
tried
to
stop
her
suddenly
he
drew
himself
up
Elena
he
said
to
her
in
a
strange
hard
voice
leave
me
go
away
What
she
replied
in
bewilderment
You
feel
ill
she
added
quickly
No
I
m
all
right
but
please
leave
me
now
I
don
t
understand
you
You
drive
me
away
What
are
you
doing
she
said
suddenly
he
had
bent
over
from
the
sofa
almost
to
the
ground
and
was
pressing
her
feet
to
his
lips
Don
t
do
that
Dmitri
Dmitri
He
got
up
Then
leave
me
You
see
Elena
when
I
was
taken
ill
I
did
not
lose
consciousness
at
first
I
knew
I
was
on
the
edge
of
the
abyss
even
in
the
fever
in
delirium
I
knew
I
felt
vaguely
that
it
was
death
coming
to
me
I
took
leave
of
life
of
you
of
everything
I
gave
up
hope
And
this
return
to
life
so
suddenly
this
light
after
the
darkness
you
you
near
me
with
me
your
voice
your
breath
It
s
more
than
I
can
stand
I
feel
I
love
you
passionately
I
hear
you
call
yourself
mine
I
can
not
answer
for
myself
You
must
go
Dmitri
whispered
Elena
and
she
nestled
her
head
on
his
shoulder
Only
now
she
understood
him
Elena
he
went
on
I
love
you
you
know
that
I
am
ready
to
give
my
life
for
you
Why
have
you
come
to
me
now
when
I
am
weak
when
I
can
t
control
myself
when
all
my
blood
s
on
fire
you
are
mine
you
say
you
love
me
Dmitri
she
repeated
she
flushed
all
over
and
pressed
still
closer
to
him
Elena
have
pity
on
me
go
away
I
feel
as
if
I
should
die
I
can
t
stand
these
violent
emotions
my
whole
soul
yearns
for
you
think
death
was
almost
parting
us
and
now
you
are
here
you
are
in
my
arms
Elena
She
was
trembling
all
over
Take
me
then
she
whispered
scarcely
above
her
breath
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
was
walking
up
and
down
in
his
study
with
a
scowl
on
his
face
Shubin
was
sitting
at
the
window
with
his
legs
crossed
tranquilly
smoking
a
cigar
Leave
off
tramping
from
corner
to
corner
please
he
observed
knocking
the
ash
off
his
cigar
I
keep
expecting
you
to
speak
there
s
a
rick
in
my
neck
from
watching
you
Besides
there
s
something
artificial
melodramatic
in
your
striding
You
can
never
do
anything
but
joke
responded
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
You
won
t
enter
into
my
position
you
refuse
to
realise
that
I
am
used
to
that
woman
that
I
am
attached
to
her
in
fact
that
her
absence
is
bound
to
distress
me
Here
it
s
October
winter
is
upon
us
What
can
she
be
doing
in
Revel
She
must
be
knitting
stockings
for
herself
for
herself
not
for
you
You
may
laugh
you
may
laugh
but
I
tell
you
I
know
no
woman
like
her
Such
honesty
such
disinterestedness
Has
she
cashed
that
bill
yet
inquired
Shubin
Such
disinterestedness
repeated
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
it
s
astonishing
They
tell
me
there
are
a
million
other
women
in
the
world
but
I
say
show
me
the
million
show
me
the
million
I
say
ces
femmes
qu
on
me
les
montre
And
she
doesn
t
write
that
s
what
s
killing
me
You
re
eloquent
as
Pythagoras
remarked
Shubin
but
do
you
know
what
I
would
advise
you
What
When
Augustina
Christianovna
comes
back
you
take
my
meaning
Yes
yes
well
what
When
you
see
her
again
you
follow
the
line
of
my
thought
Yes
yes
to
be
sure
Try
beating
her
see
what
that
would
do
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
turned
away
exasperated
I
thought
he
was
really
going
to
give
me
some
practical
advice
But
what
can
one
expect
from
him
An
artist
a
man
of
no
principles
No
principles
By
the
way
I
m
told
your
favourite
Mr
Kurnatovsky
the
man
of
principle
cleaned
you
out
of
a
hundred
roubles
last
night
That
was
hardly
delicate
you
must
own
now
What
of
it
We
were
playing
high
Of
course
I
might
expect
but
they
understand
so
little
how
to
appreciate
him
in
this
house
That
he
thought
get
what
I
can
put
in
Shubin
whether
he
s
to
be
my
father-in-law
or
not
is
still
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
but
a
hundred
roubles
is
worth
something
to
a
man
who
doesn
t
take
bribes
Father-in-law
How
the
devil
am
I
his
father-in-law
Vous
revez
mon
cher
Of
course
any
other
girl
would
be
delighted
with
such
a
suitor
Only
consider
a
man
of
spirit
and
intellect
who
has
gained
a
position
in
the
world
served
in
two
provinces
Led
the
governor
in
one
of
them
by
the
nose
remarked
Shubin
Very
likely
To
be
sure
that
s
how
it
should
be
Practical
a
business
man
And
a
capital
hand
at
cards
Shubin
remarked
again
To
be
sure
and
a
capital
hand
at
cards
But
Elena
Nikolaevna
Is
there
any
understanding
her
I
should
be
glad
to
know
if
there
is
any
one
who
would
undertake
to
make
out
what
it
is
she
wants
One
day
she
s
cheerful
another
she
s
dull
all
of
a
sudden
she
s
so
thin
there
s
no
looking
at
her
and
then
suddenly
she
s
well
again
and
all
without
any
apparent
reason
A
disagreeable-looking
man-servant
came
in
with
a
cup
of
coffee
cream
and
sugar
on
a
tray
The
father
is
pleased
with
a
suitor
pursued
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
breaking
off
a
lump
of
sugar
but
what
is
that
to
the
daughter
That
was
all
very
well
in
the
old
patriarchal
days
but
now
we
have
changed
all
that
Nous
avons
change
tout
ca
Nowadays
a
young
girl
talks
to
any
one
she
thinks
fit
reads
what
she
thinks
fit
she
goes
about
Moscow
alone
without
a
groom
or
a
maid
just
as
in
Paris
and
all
that
is
permitted
The
other
day
I
asked
Where
is
Elena
Nikolaevna
I
m
told
she
has
gone
out
Where
No
one
knows
Is
that
the
proper
thing
Take
your
coffee
and
let
the
man
go
said
Shubin
You
say
yourself
that
one
ought
not
devant
les
domestiques
he
added
in
an
undertone
The
servant
gave
Shubin
a
dubious
look
while
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
took
the
cup
of
coffee
added
some
cream
and
seized
some
ten
lumps
of
sugar
I
was
just
going
to
say
when
the
servant
came
in
he
began
that
I
count
for
nothing
in
this
house
That
s
the
long
and
short
of
the
matter
For
nowadays
every
one
judges
from
appearances
one
man
s
an
empty-headed
fool
but
gives
himself
airs
of
importance
and
he
s
respected
while
another
very
likely
has
talents
which
might
which
might
gain
him
great
distinction
but
through
modesty
Aren
t
you
a
born
statesman
asked
Shubin
in
a
jeering
voice
Give
over
playing
the
fool
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
cried
with
heat
You
forget
yourself
Here
you
have
another
proof
that
I
count
for
nothing
in
this
house
nothing
Anna
Vassilyevna
ill-uses
you
poor
fellow
said
Shubin
stretching
Ah
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
we
re
a
pair
of
sinners
You
had
much
better
be
getting
a
little
present
ready
for
Anna
Vassilyevna
It
s
her
birthday
in
a
day
or
two
and
you
know
how
she
appreciates
the
least
attention
on
your
part
Yes
yes
answered
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
hastily
I
m
much
obliged
to
you
for
reminding
me
Of
course
of
course
to
be
sure
I
have
a
little
thing
a
dressing-case
I
bought
it
the
other
day
at
Rosenstrauch
s
but
I
don
t
know
really
if
it
will
do
I
suppose
you
bought
it
for
her
the
lady
at
Revel
Why
certainly
I
had
some
idea
Well
in
that
case
it
will
be
sure
to
do
Shubin
got
up
from
his
seat
Are
we
going
out
this
evening
Pavel
Yakovlitch
eh
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
asked
with
an
amicable
leer
Why
yes
you
are
going
to
your
club
After
the
club
after
the
club
Shubin
stretched
himself
again
No
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
I
want
to
work
to-morrow
Another
time
And
he
walked
off
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
scowled
walked
twice
up
and
down
the
room
took
a
velvet
box
with
the
dressing-case
out
of
the
bureau
and
looked
at
it
a
long
while
rubbing
it
with
a
silk
handkerchief
Then
he
sat
down
before
a
looking-glass
and
began
carefully
arranging
his
thick
black
hair
turning
his
head
to
right
and
to
left
with
a
dignified
countenance
his
tongue
pressed
into
his
cheek
never
taking
his
eyes
off
his
parting
Some
one
coughed
behind
his
back
he
looked
round
and
saw
the
manservant
who
had
brought
him
in
his
coffee
What
do
you
want
he
asked
him
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
said
the
man
with
a
certain
solemnity
you
are
our
master
I
know
that
what
next
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
graciously
do
not
be
angry
with
me
but
I
having
been
in
your
honour
s
service
from
a
boy
am
bound
in
dutiful
devotion
to
bring
you
Well
what
is
it
The
man
shifted
uneasily
as
he
stood
You
condescended
to
say
your
honour
he
began
that
your
honour
did
not
know
where
Elena
Nikolaevna
was
pleased
to
go
I
have
information
about
that
What
lies
are
you
telling
idiot
That
s
as
your
honour
likes
but
T
saw
our
young
lady
three
days
ago
as
she
was
pleased
to
go
into
a
house
Where
what
what
house
In
a
house
near
Povarsky
Not
far
from
here
I
even
asked
the
doorkeeper
who
were
the
people
living
there
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
stamped
with
his
feet
Silence
scoundrel
How
dare
you
Elena
Nikolaevna
in
the
goodness
of
her
heart
goes
to
visit
the
poor
and
you
Be
off
fool
The
terrified
servant
was
rushing
to
the
door
Stop
cried
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
What
did
the
doorkeeper
say
to
you
Oh
no
nothing
he
said
nothing
He
told
me
a
stu
student
Silence
scoundrel
Listen
you
dirty
beast
if
you
ever
breathe
a
word
in
your
dreams
even
Mercy
on
us
Silence
if
you
blab
if
any
one
if
I
find
out
you
shall
find
no
hiding-place
even
underground
Do
you
hear
You
can
go
The
man
vanished
Good
Heavens
merciful
powers
what
does
it
mean
thought
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
when
he
was
left
alone
What
did
that
idiot
tell
me
Eh
I
shall
have
to
find
out
though
what
house
it
is
and
who
lives
there
I
must
go
myself
Has
it
come
to
this
Un
laquais
Quelle
humiliation
And
repeating
aloud
Un
laquais
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
shut
the
dressing-case
up
in
the
bureau
and
went
up
to
Anna
Vassilyevna
He
found
her
in
bed
with
her
face
tied
up
But
the
sight
of
her
sufferings
only
irritated
him
and
he
very
soon
reduced
her
to
tears
Meanwhile
the
storm
gathering
in
the
East
was
breaking
Turkey
had
declared
war
on
Russia
the
time
fixed
for
the
evacuation
of
the
Principalities
had
already
expired
the
day
of
the
disaster
of
Sinope
was
not
far
off
The
last
letters
received
by
Insarov
summoned
him
urgently
to
his
country
His
health
was
not
yet
restored
he
coughed
suffered
from
weakness
and
slight
attacks
of
fever
but
he
was
scarcely
ever
at
home
His
heart
was
fired
he
no
longer
thought
of
his
illness
He
was
for
ever
rushing
about
Moscow
having
secret
interviews
with
various
persons
writing
for
whole
nights
disappearing
for
whole
days
he
had
informed
his
landlord
that
he
was
going
away
shortly
and
had
presented
him
already
with
his
scanty
furniture
Elena
too
on
her
side
was
getting
ready
for
departure
One
wet
evening
she
was
sitting
in
her
room
and
listening
with
involuntary
depression
to
the
sighing
of
the
wind
while
she
hemmed
handkerchiefs
Her
maid
came
in
and
told
her
that
her
father
was
in
her
mother
s
room
and
sent
for
her
there
Your
mamma
is
crying
she
whispered
after
the
retreating
Elena
and
your
papa
is
angry
Elena
gave
a
slight
shrug
and
went
into
Anna
Vassflyevna
s
room
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
s
kind-hearted
spouse
was
half
lying
on
a
reclining
chair
sniffing
a
handkerchief
steeped
in
eau
de
Cologne
he
himself
was
standing
at
the
hearth
every
button
buttoned
up
in
a
high
hard
cravat
with
a
stiffly
starched
collar
his
deportment
had
a
vague
suggestion
of
some
parliamentary
orator
With
an
orator
s
wave
of
the
arm
he
motioned
his
daughter
to
a
chair
and
when
she
not
understanding
his
gesture
looked
inquiringly
at
him
he
brought
out
with
dignity
without
turning
his
head
I
beg
you
to
be
seated
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
always
used
the
formal
plural
in
addressing
his
wife
but
only
on
extraordinary
occasions
in
addressing
his
daughter
Elena
sat
down
Anna
Vassilyevna
blew
her
nose
tearfully
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
thrust
his
fingers
between
his
coat-buttons
I
sent
for
you
Elena
Nikolaevna
he
began
after
a
protracted
silence
in
order
to
have
an
explanation
with
you
or
rather
in
order
to
ask
you
for
an
explanation
I
am
displeased
with
you
or
no
that
is
too
little
to
say
your
behaviour
is
a
pain
and
an
outrage
to
me
to
me
and
to
your
mother
your
mother
whom
you
see
here
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
was
giving
vent
only
to
the
few
bass
notes
in
his
voice
Elena
gazed
in
silence
at
him
then
at
Anna
Vassilyevna
and
turned
pale
There
was
a
time
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
resumed
when
daughters
did
not
allow
themselves
to
look
down
on
their
parents
when
the
parental
authority
forced
the
disobedient
to
tremble
That
time
has
passed
unhappily
so
at
least
many
persons
imagine
but
let
me
tell
you
there
are
still
laws
which
do
not
permit
do
not
permit
in
fact
there
are
still
laws
I
beg
you
to
mark
that
there
are
still
laws
But
papa
Elena
was
beginning
I
beg
you
not
to
interrupt
me
Let
us
turn
in
thought
to
the
past
I
and
Anna
Vassilyevna
have
performed
our
duty
I
and
Anna
Vassilyevna
have
spared
nothing
in
your
education
neither
care
nor
expense
What
you
have
gained
from
our
care
is
a
different
question
but
I
had
the
right
to
expect
I
and
Anna
Vassilyevna
had
the
right
to
expect
that
you
would
at
least
hold
sacred
the
principles
of
morality
which
we
have
que
nous
avons
inculques
which
we
have
instilled
into
you
our
only
daughter
We
had
the
right
to
expect
that
no
new
ideas
could
touch
that
so
to
speak
holy
shrine
And
what
do
we
find
I
am
not
now
speaking
of
frivolities
characteristic
of
your
sex
and
age
but
who
could
have
anticipated
that
you
could
so
far
forget
yourself
Papa
said
Elena
I
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
No
you
don
t
know
what
I
am
going
to
say
cried
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
in
a
falsetto
shriek
suddenly
losing
the
majesty
of
his
oratorical
pose
the
smooth
dignity
of
his
speech
and
his
bass
notes
You
don
t
know
vile
hussy
For
mercy
s
sake
Nicolas
murmured
Anna
Vassilyevna
vous
me
faites
mourir
Don
t
tell
me
que
je
vous
fais
mourir
Anna
Vassilyevna
You
can
t
conceive
what
you
will
hear
directly
Prepare
yourself
for
the
worst
I
warn
you
Anna
Vassilyevna
seemed
stupefied
No
resumed
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
turning
to
Elena
you
don
t
know
what
I
am
going
to
say
I
am
to
blame
towards
you
she
began
Ah
at
last
I
am
to
blame
towards
you
pursued
Elena
for
not
having
long
ago
confessed
But
do
you
know
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
interrupted
that
I
can
crush
you
with
one
word
Elena
raised
her
eyes
to
look
at
him
Yes
madam
with
one
word
It
s
useless
to
look
at
me
He
crossed
his
arms
on
his
breast
Allow
me
to
ask
you
do
you
know
a
certain
house
near
Povarsky
Have
you
visited
that
house
He
stamped
Answer
me
worthless
girl
and
don
t
try
to
hide
the
truth
People
people
servants
madam
de
vils
laquais
have
seen
you
as
you
went
in
there
to
your
Elena
was
crimson
her
eyes
were
blazing
I
have
no
need
to
hide
anything
she
declared
Yes
I
have
visited
that
house
Exactly
Do
you
hear
do
you
hear
Anna
Vassilyevna
And
you
know
I
presume
who
lives
there
Yes
I
know
my
husband
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
s
eyes
were
starting
out
of
his
head
Your
My
husband
repeated
Elena
I
am
married
to
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
Insarov
You
married
was
all
Anna
Vassilyevna
could
articulate
Yes
mamma
Forgive
me
A
fortnight
ago
we
were
secretly
married
Anna
Vassilyevna
fell
back
in
her
chair
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
stepped
two
paces
back
Married
To
that
vagrant
that
Montenegrin
the
daughter
of
Nikolai
Stahov
of
the
higher
nobility
married
to
a
vagrant
a
nobody
without
her
parents
sanction
And
you
imagine
I
shall
let
the
matter
rest
that
I
shall
not
make
a
complaint
that
I
will
allow
you
that
you
that
To
the
nunnery
with
you
and
he
shall
go
to
prison
to
hard
labour
Anna
Vassilyevna
inform
her
at
once
that
you
will
cut
off
her
inheritance
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
for
God
s
sake
moaned
Anna
Vassilyevna
And
when
and
how
was
this
done
Who
married
you
where
how
Good
God
what
will
all
our
friends
think
what
will
the
world
say
And
you
shameless
hypocrite
could
go
on
living
under
your
parents
roof
after
such
an
act
Had
you
no
fear
of
the
wrath
of
heaven
Papa
said
Elena
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
but
her
voice
was
steady
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
with
me
as
you
please
but
you
need
not
accuse
me
of
shamelessness
and
hypocrisy
I
did
not
want
to
give
you
pain
before
but
I
should
have
had
to
tell
you
all
myself
in
a
few
days
because
we
are
going
away
my
husband
and
I
from
here
next
week
Going
away
Where
to
To
his
own
country
to
Bulgaria
To
the
Turks
cried
Anna
Vassilyevna
and
fell
into
a
swoon
Elena
ran
to
her
mother
Away
clamoured
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
seizing
his
daughter
by
the
arm
away
unworthy
girl
But
at
that
instant
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
a
pale
face
with
glittering
eyes
appeared
it
was
the
face
of
Shubin
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
Augustina
Christianovna
is
here
and
is
asking
for
you
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
turned
round
infuriated
threatening
Shubin
with
his
fist
he
stood
still
a
minute
and
rapidly
went
out
of
the
room
Elena
fell
at
her
mother
s
feet
and
embraced
her
knees
Uvar
Ivanovitch
was
lying
on
his
bed
A
shirt
without
a
collar
fastened
with
a
heavy
stud
enfolded
his
thick
neck
and
fell
in
full
flowing
folds
over
the
almost
feminine
contours
of
his
chest
leaving
visible
a
large
cypress-wood
cross
and
an
amulet
His
ample
limbs
were
covered
with
the
lightest
bedclothes
On
the
little
table
by
the
bedside
a
candle
was
burning
dimly
beside
a
jug
of
kvas
and
on
the
bed
at
Uvar
ivanovitch
s
feet
was
sitting
Shubin
in
a
dejected
pose
Yes
he
was
saying
meditatively
she
is
married
and
getting
ready
to
go
away
Your
nephew
was
bawling
and
shouting
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
house
he
had
shut
himself
up
for
greater
privacy
in
his
wife
s
bedroom
but
not
