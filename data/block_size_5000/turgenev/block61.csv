with
her
mother
and
my
old
aunt
eh
Would
you
like
it
Lemm
bent
his
head
over
his
plate
Invite
her
he
murmured
scarcely
audibly
But
Panshin
isn
t
wanted
No
he
isn
t
wanted
rejoined
the
old
man
with
an
almost
child-like
smile
Two
days
later
Fedor
Ivanitch
set
off
to
the
town
to
see
the
Kalitins
He
found
them
all
at
home
but
he
did
not
at
once
disclose
his
plan
to
them
he
wanted
to
discuss
it
first
with
Lisa
alone
Fortune
favoured
him
they
were
left
alone
in
the
drawing-room
They
had
some
talk
she
had
had
time
by
now
to
grow
used
to
him
and
she
was
not
shy
as
a
rule
with
any
one
He
listened
to
her
watched
her
and
mentally
repeated
Lemm
s
words
and
agreed
with
them
It
sometimes
happens
that
two
people
who
are
acquainted
but
not
on
intimate
terms
with
one
another
all
of
sudden
grow
rapidly
more
intimate
in
a
few
minutes
and
the
consciousness
of
this
greater
intimacy
is
at
once
expressed
in
their
eyes
in
their
soft
and
affectionate
smiles
and
in
their
very
gestures
This
was
exactly
what
came
to
pass
with
Lavretsky
and
Lisa
So
he
is
like
that
was
her
thought
as
she
turned
a
friendly
glance
on
him
so
you
are
like
that
he
too
was
thinking
And
so
he
was
not
very
much
surprised
when
she
informed
him
not
without
a
little
faltering
however
that
she
had
long
wished
to
say
something
to
him
but
she
was
afraid
of
offending
him
Don
t
be
afraid
tell
me
he
replied
and
stood
still
before
her
Lisa
raised
her
clear
eyes
to
him
You
are
so
good
she
began
and
at
the
same
time
she
thought
Yes
I
am
sure
he
is
good
you
will
forgive
me
I
ought
not
dare
to
speak
of
it
to
you
but
how
could
you
why
did
you
separate
from
your
wife
Lavretsky
shuddered
he
looked
at
Lisa
and
sat
down
near
her
My
child
he
began
I
beg
you
do
not
touch
upon
that
wound
your
hands
are
tender
but
it
will
hurt
me
all
the
same
I
know
Lisa
went
on
as
though
she
did
not
hear
him
she
has
been
to
blame
towards
you
I
don
t
want
to
defend
her
but
what
God
has
joined
how
can
you
put
asunder
Our
convictions
on
that
subject
are
too
different
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
Lavretsky
observed
rather
sharply
we
can
not
understand
one
another
Lisa
grew
paler
her
whole
frame
was
trembling
slightly
but
she
was
not
silenced
You
must
forgive
she
murmured
softly
if
you
wish
to
be
forgiven
Forgive
broke
in
Lavretsky
Ought
you
not
first
to
know
whom
you
are
interceding
for
Forgive
that
woman
take
her
back
into
my
home
that
empty
heartless
creature
And
who
told
you
she
wants
to
return
to
me
She
is
perfectly
contented
with
her
position
I
can
assure
you
But
what
a
subject
to
discuss
here
Her
name
ought
never
to
be
uttered
by
you
You
are
too
pure
you
are
not
capable
of
understanding
such
a
creature
Why
abuse
her
Lisa
articulated
with
an
effort
The
trembling
of
her
hands
was
perceptible
now
You
left
her
yourself
Fedor
Ivanitch
But
I
tell
you
retorted
Lavretsky
with
an
involuntary
outburst
of
impatience
you
don
t
know
what
that
woman
is
Then
why
did
you
marry
her
whispered
Lisa
and
her
eyes
feel
Lavretsky
got
up
quickly
from
his
seat
Why
did
I
marry
her
I
was
young
and
inexperienced
I
was
deceived
I
was
carried
away
by
a
beautiful
exterior
I
knew
no
women
I
knew
nothing
God
grant
you
may
make
a
happier
marriage
but
let
me
tell
you
you
can
be
sure
of
nothing
I
too
might
be
unhappy
said
Lisa
her
voice
had
begun
to
be
unsteady
but
then
I
ought
to
submit
I
don
t
know
how
to
say
it
but
if
we
do
not
submit
Lavretsky
clenched
his
hands
and
stamped
with
his
foot
Don
t
be
angry
forgive
me
Lisa
faltered
hurriedly
At
that
instant
Marya
Dmitrievna
came
in
Lisa
got
up
and
was
going
away
Stop
a
minute
Lavretsky
cried
after
her
unexpectedly
I
have
a
great
favour
to
beg
of
your
mother
and
you
to
pay
me
a
visit
in
my
new
abode
You
know
I
have
had
a
piano
sent
over
Lemm
is
staying
with
me
the
lilac
is
in
flower
now
you
will
get
a
breath
of
country
air
and
you
can
return
the
same
day
will
you
consent
Lisa
looked
towards
her
mother
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
assuming
an
expression
of
suffering
but
Lavretsky
did
not
give
her
time
to
open
her
mouth
he
at
once
kissed
both
her
hands
Marya
Dmitrievna
who
was
always
susceptible
to
demonstrations
of
feeling
and
did
not
at
all
anticipate
such
effusivements
from
the
dolt
was
melted
and
gave
her
consent
While
she
was
deliberating
which
day
to
fix
Lavretsky
went
up
to
Lisa
and
still
greatly
moved
whispered
to
her
aside
Thank
you
you
are
a
good
girl
I
was
to
blame
And
her
pale
face
glowed
with
a
bright
shy
smile
her
eyes
smiled
too
up
to
that
instant
she
had
been
afraid
she
had
offended
him
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
can
come
with
us
inquired
Marya
Dmitrievna
Yes
replied
Lavretsky
but
would
it
not
be
better
to
be
just
a
family
party
Well
you
know
it
seems
began
Marya
Dmitrievna
But
as
you
please
she
added
It
was
decided
to
take
Lenotchka
and
Shurotchka
Marfa
Timofyevna
refused
to
join
in
the
expedition
It
is
hard
for
me
my
darling
she
said
to
give
my
old
bones
a
shaking
and
to
be
sure
there
s
nowhere
for
me
to
sleep
at
your
place
besides
I
can
t
sleep
in
a
strange
bed
Let
the
young
folks
go
frolicking
Lavretsky
did
not
succeed
in
being
alone
again
with
Lisa
but
he
looked
at
her
in
such
a
way
that
she
felt
her
heart
at
rest
and
a
little
ashamed
and
sorry
for
him
He
pressed
her
hand
warmly
at
parting
left
alone
she
fell
to
musing
When
Lavretsky
reached
home
he
was
met
at
the
door
of
the
drawing-room
by
a
tall
thin
man
in
a
thread-bare
blue
coat
with
a
wrinkled
but
lively
face
with
disheveled
grey
whiskers
a
long
straight
nose
and
small
fiery
eyes
This
was
Mihalevitch
who
had
been
his
friend
at
the
university
Lavretsky
did
not
at
first
recognise
him
but
embraced
him
warmly
directly
he
told
his
name
They
had
not
met
since
their
Moscow
days
Torrents
of
exclamations
and
questions
followed
long-buried
recollections
were
brought
to
light
Hurriedly
smoking
pipe
after
pipe
tossing
off
tea
at
a
gulp
and
gesticulating
with
his
long
hands
Mihalevitch
related
his
adventures
to
Lavretsky
there
was
nothing
very
inspiriting
in
them
he
could
not
boast
of
success
in
his
undertakings
but
he
was
constantly
laughing
a
hoarse
nervous
laugh
A
month
previously
he
had
received
a
position
in
the
private
counting-house
of
a
spirit-tax
contractor
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
the
town
of
O
and
hearing
of
Lavretsky
returned
from
abroad
he
had
turned
out
of
his
way
so
as
to
see
his
old
friend
Mihalevitch
and
talked
as
impetuously
as
in
his
youth
made
as
much
noise
and
was
as
effervescent
as
of
old
Lavretsky
was
about
to
acquaint
him
with
his
new
position
but
Mihalevitch
interrupted
him
muttering
hurriedly
I
have
heard
my
dear
fellow
I
have
heard
who
could
have
anticipated
it
and
at
once
turned
the
conversation
upon
general
subjects
I
must
set
off
to-morrow
my
dear
fellow
he
observed
to-day
if
you
will
excuse
it
we
will
sit
up
late
I
want
above
all
to
know
what
you
are
like
what
are
your
views
and
convictions
what
you
have
become
what
life
has
taught
you
Mihalevitch
still
preserved
the
phraseology
of
1830
As
for
me
I
have
changed
in
much
the
waves
of
life
have
broken
over
my
breast
who
was
it
said
that
though
in
what
is
important
essential
I
have
not
changed
I
believe
as
of
old
in
the
good
the
true
but
I
do
not
only
believe
I
have
faith
now
yes
I
have
faith
faith
Listen
you
know
I
write
verses
there
is
no
poetry
in
them
but
there
is
truth
I
will
read
you
aloud
my
last
poem
I
have
expressed
my
truest
convictions
in
it
Listen
Mihalevitch
fell
to
reading
his
poem
it
was
rather
long
and
ended
with
the
following
lines
I
gave
myself
to
new
feelings
with
all
my
heart
And
my
soul
became
as
a
child
s
And
I
have
burnt
all
I
adored
And
now
adore
all
that
I
burnt
As
he
uttered
the
two
last
lines
Mihalevitch
all
but
shed
tears
a
slight
spasm
the
sign
of
deep
emotion
passed
over
his
wide
mouth
his
ugly
face
lighted
up
Lavretsky
listened
and
listened
to
him
and
the
spirit
of
antagonism
was
aroused
in
him
he
was
irritated
by
the
ever-ready
enthusiasm
of
the
Moscow
student
perpetually
at
boiling-point
Before
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
elapsed
a
heated
argument
had
broken
out
between
them
one
of
these
endless
arguments
of
which
only
Russians
are
capable
After
a
separation
of
many
years
spent
in
two
different
worlds
with
no
clear
understanding
of
the
other
s
ideas
or
even
of
their
own
catching
at
words
and
replying
only
in
words
they
disputed
about
the
most
abstract
subjects
and
they
disputed
as
though
it
were
a
matter
of
life
and
death
for
both
they
shouted
and
vociferated
so
that
every
one
in
the
house
was
startled
and
poor
Lemm
who
had
locked
himself
up
in
his
room
directly
after
Mihalevitch
arrived
was
bewildered
and
began
even
to
feel
vaguely
alarmed
What
are
you
after
all
a
pessimist
cried
Mihalevitch
at
one
o
clock
in
the
night
Are
pessimists
usually
like
this
replied
Lavretsky
They
are
usually
all
pale
and
sickly
would
you
like
me
to
lift
you
with
one
hand
Well
if
you
are
not
a
pessimist
you
are
a
scepteec
that
s
still
worse
Mihalevitch
s
talk
had
a
strong
flavour
of
his
mother-country
Little
Russia
And
what
right
have
you
to
be
a
scepteec
You
have
had
ill-luck
in
life
let
us
admit
that
was
not
your
fault
you
were
born
with
a
passionate
loving
heart
and
you
were
unnaturally
kept
out
of
the
society
of
women
the
first
woman
you
came
across
was
bound
to
deceive
you
She
deceived
you
too
observed
Lavretsky
grimly
Granted
granted
I
was
the
tool
of
destiny
in
it
what
nonsense
I
talk
though
there
is
no
such
thing
as
destiny
it
is
an
old
habit
of
expressing
things
inexactly
But
what
does
that
prove
It
proves
this
that
they
distorted
me
from
my
childhood
Well
it
s
for
you
to
straighten
yourself
What
s
the
good
of
being
a
man
a
male
animal
And
however
that
may
be
is
it
possible
is
it
permissible
to
reduce
a
personal
so
to
speak
fact
to
a
general
law
to
an
infallible
principle
How
a
principle
interrupted
Lavretsky
I
don
t
admit
No
it
is
your
principle
your
principle
Mihalevitch
interrupted
in
his
turn
You
are
an
egoist
that
s
what
it
is
he
was
thundering
an
hour
later
you
wanted
personal
happiness
you
wanted
enjoyment
in
life
you
wanted
to
live
only
for
yourself
What
do
you
mean
by
personal
happiness
And
everything
deceived
you
everything
crumbled
away
under
your
feet
What
do
you
mean
by
personal
happiness
I
ask
you
And
it
was
bound
to
crumble
away
Either
you
sought
support
where
it
could
not
be
found
or
you
built
your
house
on
shifting
sands
or
Speak
more
plainly
or
I
can
t
understand
you
Or
you
may
laugh
if
you
like
or
you
had
no
faith
no
warmth
of
heart
intellect
nothing
but
one
farthing
s
worth
of
intellect
you
are
simply
a
pitiful
antiquated
Voltairean
that
s
what
you
are
I
m
a
Voltairean
Yes
like
your
father
and
you
yourself
do
not
suspect
it
After
that
exclaimed
Lavretsky
I
have
the
right
to
call
you
a
fanatic
Alas
replied
Mihalevitch
with
a
contrite
air
I
have
not
so
far
deserved
such
an
exalted
title
unhappily
I
have
found
out
now
what
to
call
you
cried
the
same
Mihalevitch
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
You
are
not
a
sceptic
nor
a
pessimist
nor
a
Voltairean
you
are
a
loafer
and
you
are
a
vicious
loafer
a
conscious
loafer
not
a
simple
loafer
Simple
loafers
lie
on
the
stove
and
do
nothing
because
they
don
t
know
how
to
do
anything
they
don
t
think
about
anything
either
but
you
are
a
man
of
ideas
and
yet
you
lie
on
the
stove
you
could
do
something
and
you
do
nothing
you
lie
idle
with
a
full
stomach
and
look
down
from
above
and
say
It
s
best
to
lie
idle
like
this
because
whatever
people
do
is
all
rubbish
leading
to
nothing
And
from
what
do
you
infer
that
I
lie
idle
Lavretsky
protested
stoutly
Why
do
you
attribute
such
ideas
to
me
And
besides
that
you
are
all
all
the
tribe
of
you
continued
Mihalevitch
cultivated
loafers
You
know
which
leg
the
German
limps
on
you
know
what
s
amiss
with
the
English
and
the
French
and
your
pitiful
culture
goes
to
make
it
worse
your
shameful
idleness
your
abominable
inactivity
is
justified
by
it
Some
are
even
proud
of
it
I
m
such
a
clever
fellow
they
say
I
do
nothing
while
these
fools
are
in
a
fuss
Yes
and
there
are
fine
gentlemen
among
us
though
I
don
t
say
this
as
to
you
who
reduce
their
whole
life
to
a
kind
of
stupor
of
boredom
get
used
to
it
live
in
it
like
like
a
mushroom
in
white
sauce
Mihalevitch
added
hastily
and
he
laughed
at
his
own
comparison
Oh
this
stupor
of
boredom
is
the
ruin
of
Russians
Ours
is
the
age
for
work
and
the
sickening
loafer
But
what
is
all
this
abuse
about
Lavretsky
clamoured
in
his
turn
Work
doing
you
d
better
say
what
is
to
be
done
instead
of
abusing
me
Desmosthenes
of
Poltava
There
what
a
thing
to
ask
I
can
t
tell
you
that
brother
that
every
one
ought
to
know
for
himself
retorted
the
Desmosthenes
ironically
A
landowner
a
nobleman
and
not
know
what
to
do
You
have
no
faith
or
else
you
would
know
no
faith
and
no
intuition
Let
me
at
least
have
time
to
breathe
you
don
t
let
me
have
time
to
look
round
Lavretsky
besought
him
Not
a
minute
nor
a
second
retorted
Mihalevitch
with
an
imperious
wave
of
the
hand
Not
one
second
death
does
not
delay
and
life
ought
not
to
delay
And
what
a
time
what
a
place
for
men
to
think
of
loafing
he
cried
at
four
o
clock
in
a
voice
however
which
showed
signs
of
sleepiness
among
us
now
in
Russia
where
every
separate
individual
has
a
duty
resting
upon
him
a
solemn
responsibility
to
God
to
the
people
to
himself
We
are
sleeping
and
the
time
is
slipping
away
we
are
sleeping
Permit
me
to
observe
remarked
Lavretsky
that
we
are
not
sleeping
at
present
but
rather
preventing
others
from
sleeping
We
are
straining
our
throats
like
the
cocks
listen
there
is
one
crowing
for
the
third
time
This
sally
made
Mihalevitch
laugh
and
calmed
him
down
Good-bye
till
to-morrow
he
said
with
a
smile
and
thrust
his
pipe
into
his
pouch
Till
to-morrow
repeated
Lavretsky
But
the
friends
talked
for
more
than
hour
longer
Their
voices
were
no
longer
raised
however
and
their
talk
was
quiet
sad
friendly
talk
Mihalevitch
set
off
the
next
day
in
spite
of
all
Lavretsky
s
efforts
to
keep
him
Fedor
Ivanitch
did
not
succeed
in
persuading
him
to
remain
but
he
talked
to
him
to
his
heart
s
content
Mihalevitch
it
appeared
had
not
a
penny
to
bless
himself
with
Lavretsky
had
noticed
with
pain
the
evening
before
all
the
tokens
and
habits
of
years
of
poverty
his
boots
were
shabby
a
button
was
off
on
the
back
of
his
coat
on
his
arrival
he
had
not
even
thought
of
asking
to
wash
and
at
supper
he
ate
like
a
shark
tearing
his
meat
in
his
fingers
and
crunching
the
bones
with
his
strong
black
teeth
It
appeared
too
that
he
had
made
nothing
out
of
his
employment
that
he
now
rested
all
his
hopes
on
the
contractor
who
was
taking
him
solely
in
order
to
have
an
educated
man
in
his
office
For
all
that
Mihalevitch
was
not
discouraged
but
as
idealist
or
cynic
lived
on
a
crust
of
bread
sincerely
rejoicing
or
grieving
over
the
destinies
of
humanity
and
his
own
vocation
and
troubling
himself
very
little
as
to
how
to
escape
dying
of
hunger
Mihalevitch
was
not
married
but
had
been
in
love
times
beyond
number
and
had
written
poems
to
all
the
objects
of
his
adoration
he
sang
with
especial
fervour
the
praises
of
a
mysterious
black-tressed
noble
Polish
lady
There
were
rumours
it
is
true
that
this
noble
Polish
lady
was
a
simple
Jewess
very
well
known
to
a
good
many
cavalry
officers
but
after
all
what
do
you
think
does
it
really
make
any
difference
With
Lemm
Mihalevitch
did
not
get
on
his
noisy
talk
and
brusque
manners
scared
the
German
who
was
unused
to
such
behaviour
One
poor
devil
detects
another
by
instinct
at
once
but
in
old
age
he
rarely
gets
on
with
him
and
that
is
hardly
astonishing
he
has
nothing
to
share
with
him
not
even
hopes
Before
setting
off
Mihalevitch
had
another
long
discussion
with
Lavretsky
foretold
his
ruin
if
he
did
not
see
the
error
of
his
ways
exhorted
him
to
devote
himself
seriously
to
the
welfare
of
his
peasants
and
pointed
to
himself
as
an
example
saying
that
he
had
been
purified
in
the
furnace
of
suffering
and
in
the
same
breath
called
himself
several
times
a
happy
man
comparing
himself
with
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
the
lily
of
the
field
A
black
lily
any
way
observed
Lavretsky
Ah
brother
don
t
be
a
snob
retorted
Mihalevitch
good-naturedly
but
thank
God
rather
there
is
a
pure
plebeian
blood
in
your
veins
too
But
I
see
that
you
want
some
pure
heavenly
creature
to
draw
you
out
of
your
apathy
Thanks
brother
remarked
Lavretsky
I
have
had
quite
enough
of
those
heavenly
creatures
Silence
ceeneec
cried
Mihalevitch
Cynic
Lavretsky
corrected
him
Ceeneec
just
so
repeated
Mihalevitch
unabashed
Even
when
he
had
taken
his
seat
in
the
carriage
to
which
his
flat
yellow
strangely
light
trunk
was
carried
he
still
talked
muffled
in
a
kind
of
Spanish
cloak
with
a
collar
brown
with
age
and
a
clasp
of
two
lion
s
paws
he
went
on
developing
his
views
on
the
destiny
of
Russian
and
waving
his
swarthy
hand
in
the
air
as
though
he
were
sowing
the
seeds
of
her
future
prosperity
The
horses
started
at
last
Remember
my
three
last
words
he
cried
thrusting
his
whole
body
out
of
the
carriage
and
balancing
so
Religion
progress
humanity
Farewell
His
head
with
a
foraging
cap
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
disappeared
Lavretsky
was
left
standing
alone
on
the
steps
and
he
gazed
steadily
into
the
distance
along
the
road
till
the
carriage
disappeared
out
of
sight
Perhaps
he
is
right
after
all
he
thought
as
he
went
back
into
the
house
perhaps
I
am
a
loafer
Many
of
Mihalevitch
s
words
had
sunk
irresistibly
into
his
heart
though
he
had
disputed
and
disagreed
with
him
If
a
man
only
has
a
good
heart
no
one
can
resist
him
Two
days
later
Marya
Dmitrievna
visited
Vassilyevskoe
according
to
her
promise
with
all
her
young
people
The
little
girls
ran
at
once
into
the
garden
while
Marya
Dmitrievna
languidly
walked
through
the
rooms
and
languidly
admired
everything
She
regarded
her
visit
to
Lavretsky
as
a
sign
of
great
condescension
almost
as
a
deed
of
charity
She
smiled
graciously
when
Anton
and
Apraxya
kissed
her
hand
in
the
old-fashioned
house-servants
style
and
in
a
weak
voice
speaking
through
her
nose
asked
for
some
tea
To
the
great
vexation
of
Anton
who
had
put
on
knitted
white
gloves
for
the
purpose
tea
was
not
handed
to
the
grand
lady
visitor
by
him
but
by
Lavretsky
s
hired
valet
who
in
the
old
man
s
words
had
not
a
notion
of
what
was
proper
To
make
up
for
this
Anton
resumed
his
rights
at
dinner
he
took
up
a
firm
position
behind
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
chair
and
he
would
not
surrender
his
post
to
any
one
The
appearance
of
guests
after
so
long
an
interval
at
Vassilyevskoe
fluttered
and
delighted
the
old
man
It
was
a
pleasure
to
him
to
see
that
his
master
was
acquainted
with
such
fine
gentlefolk
He
was
not
however
the
only
one
who
was
fluttered
that
day
Lemm
too
was
in
agitation
He
had
put
on
a
rather
short
snuff-coloured
coat
with
a
swallow-tail
and
tied
his
neck
handkerchief
stiffly
and
he
kept
incessantly
coughing
and
making
way
for
people
with
a
cordial
and
affable
air
Lavretsky
noticed
with
pleasure
that
his
relations
with
Lisa
were
becoming
more
intimate
she
had
held
out
her
hand
to
him
affectionately
directly
she
came
in
After
dinner
Lemm
drew
out
of
his
coat-tail
pocket
into
which
he
had
continually
been
fumbling
a
small
roll
of
music-paper
and
compressing
his
lips
he
laid
it
without
speaking
on
the
pianoforte
It
was
a
song
composed
by
him
the
evening
before
to
some
old-fashioned
German
words
in
which
mention
was
made
of
the
stars
Lisa
sat
down
at
once
to
the
piano
and
played
at
sight
the
song
Alas
the
music
turned
out
to
be
complicated
and
painfully
strained
it
was
clear
that
the
composer
had
striven
to
express
something
passionate
and
deep
but
nothing
had
come
of
it
the
effort
had
remained
an
effort
Lavretsky
and
Lisa
both
felt
this
and
Lemm
understood
it
Without
uttering
a
single
word
he
put
his
song
back
into
his
pocket
and
in
reply
to
Lisa
s
proposal
to
play
it
again
he
only
shook
his
head
and
said
significantly
Now
enough
and
shrinking
into
himself
he
turned
away
Towards
evening
the
whole
party
went
out
to
fish
In
the
pond
behind
the
garden
there
were
plenty
of
carp
and
groundlings
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
put
in
an
arm-chair
near
the
banks
in
the
shade
with
a
rug
under
her
feet
and
the
best
line
was
given
to
her
Anton
as
an
old
experienced
angler
offered
her
his
services
He
zealously
put
on
the
worms
and
clapped
his
hand
on
them
spat
on
them
and
even
threw
in
the
line
with
a
graceful
forward
swing
of
his
whole
body
Marya
Dmitrievna
spoke
of
him
the
same
day
to
Fedor
Ivanitch
in
the
following
phrase
in
boarding-school
French
Il
n
y
a
plus
maintenant
de
ces
gens
comme
ca
comme
autrefois
Lemm
with
the
two
little
girls
went
off
further
to
the
dam
of
the
pond
Lavretsky
took
up
his
position
near
Lisa
The
fish
were
continually
biting
the
carp
were
constantly
flashing
in
the
air
with
golden
and
silvery
sides
as
they
were
drawn
in
the
cries
of
pleasure
of
the
little
girls
were
incessant
even
Marya
Dmitrievna
uttered
a
little
feminine
shriek
on
two
occasions
The
fewest
fish
were
caught
by
Lavretsky
and
Lisa
probably
this
was
because
they
paid
less
attention
than
the
others
to
the
angling
and
allowed
their
floats
to
swim
back
right
up
to
the
bank
The
high
reddish
reeds
rustled
quietly
around
the
still
water
shone
quietly
before
them
and
quietly
too
they
talked
together
Lisa
was
standing
on
a
small
raft
Lavretsky
sat
on
the
inclined
trunk
of
a
willow
Lisa
wore
a
white
gown
tied
round
the
waist
with
a
broad
ribbon
also
white
her
straw
hat
was
hanging
on
one
hand
and
in
the
other
with
some
effort
she
held
up
the
crooked
rod
Lavretsky
gazed
at
her
pure
somewhat
severe
profile
at
her
hair
drawn
back
behind
her
ears
at
her
soft
cheeks
which
glowed
like
a
little
child
s
and
thought
Oh
how
sweet
you
are
bending
over
my
pond
Lisa
did
not
turn
to
him
but
looked
at
the
water
half
frowning
to
keep
the
sun
out
of
her
eyes
half
smiling
The
shade
of
the
lime-tree
near
fell
upon
both
Do
you
know
began
Lavretsky
I
have
been
thinking
over
our
last
conversation
a
great
deal
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
are
exceedingly
good
That
was
not
at
all
my
intention
in
Lisa
was
beginning
to
reply
and
she
was
overcome
with
embarrassment
You
are
good
repeated
Lavretsky
I
am
a
rough
fellow
but
I
feel
that
every
one
must
love
you
There
s
Lemm
for
instance
he
is
simply
in
love
with
you
Lisa
s
brows
did
not
exactly
frown
they
contracted
slightly
it
always
happened
with
her
when
she
heard
something
disagreeable
to
her
I
was
very
sorry
for
him
to-day
Lavretsky
added
with
his
unsuccessful
song
To
be
young
and
to
fail
is
bearable
but
to
be
old
and
not
be
successful
is
hard
to
bear
And
how
mortifying
it
is
to
feel
that
one
s
forces
are
deserting
one
It
is
hard
for
an
old
man
to
bear
such
blows
Be
careful
you
have
a
bite
They
say
added
Lavretsky
after
a
short
pause
that
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
has
written
a
very
pretty
song
Yes
replied
Lisa
it
is
only
a
trifle
but
not
bad
And
what
do
you
think
inquired
Lavretsky
is
he
a
good
musician
I
think
he
has
great
talent
for
music
but
so
far
he
has
not
worked
at
it
as
he
should
Ah
And
is
he
a
good
sort
of
man
Lisa
laughed
and
glanced
quickly
at
Fedor
Ivanitch
What
a
queer
question
she
exclaimed
drawing
up
her
line
and
throwing
it
in
again
further
off
Why
is
it
queer
I
ask
you
about
him
as
one
who
has
only
lately
come
here
as
a
relation
A
relation
Yes
I
am
it
seems
a
sort
of
uncle
of
yours
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
has
a
good
heart
said
Lisa
and
he
is
clever
maman
likes
him
very
much
And
do
you
like
him
He
is
nice
why
should
I
not
like
him
Ah
Lavretsky
uttered
and
ceased
speaking
A
half-mournful
half-ironical
expression
passed
over
his
face
His
steadfast
gaze
embarrassed
Lisa
but
he
went
on
smiling
Well
God
grant
them
happiness
he
muttered
at
last
as
though
to
himself
and
turned
away
his
head
Lisa
flushed
You
are
mistaken
Fedor
Ivanitch
she
said
you
are
wrong
in
thinking
But
don
t
you
like
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
she
asked
suddenly
No
I
don
t
Why
I
think
he
has
no
heart
The
smile
left
Lisa
s
face
It
is
your
habit
to
judge
people
severely
she
observed
after
a
long
silence
I
don
t
think
it
is
What
right
have
I
to
judge
others
severely
do
you
suppose
when
I
must
ask
for
indulgency
myself
Or
have
you
forgotten
that
I
am
a
laughing
stock
to
everyone
who
is
not
too
indifferent
even
to
scoff
By
the
way
he
added
did
you
keep
your
promise
What
promise
Did
you
pray
for
me
Yes
I
prayed
for
you
and
I
pray
for
you
every
day
But
please
do
not
speak
lightly
of
that
Lavretsky
began
to
assure
Lisa
that
the
idea
of
doing
so
had
never
entered
his
head
that
he
had
the
deepest
reverence
for
every
conviction
then
he
went
off
into
a
discourse
upon
religion
its
significance
in
the
history
of
mankind
the
significance
of
Christianity
One
must
be
a
Christian
observed
Lisa
not
without
some
effort
not
so
as
to
know
the
divine
and
the
earthly
because
every
man
has
to
die
Lavretsky
raised
his
eyes
in
involuntary
astonishment
upon
Lisa
and
met
her
gaze
What
a
strange
saying
you
have
just
uttered
he
said
It
is
not
my
saying
she
replied
Not
yours
But
what
made
you
speak
of
death
I
don
t
know
I
often
think
of
it
Often
Yes
One
would
not
suppose
so
looking
at
you
now
you
have
such
a
bright
happy
face
you
are
smiling
Yes
I
am
very
happy
just
now
replied
Lisa
simply
Lavretsky
would
have
liked
to
seize
both
her
hands
and
press
them
warmly
Lisa
Lisa
cried
Marya
Dmitrievna
do
come
here
and
look
what
a
fine
carp
I
have
caught
In
a
minute
maman
replied
Lisa
and
went
towards
her
but
Lavretsky
remained
sitting
on
his
willow
I
talk
to
her
just
as
if
life
were
not
over
for
me
he
thought
As
she
went
away
Lisa
hung
her
hat
on
a
twig
with
strange
almost
tender
emotion
Lavretsky
looked
at
the
hat
and
its
long
rather
crumpled
ribbons
Lisa
soon
came
back
to
him
and
again
took
her
stand
on
the
platform
What
makes
you
think
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
has
no
heart
she
asked
a
few
minutes
later
I
have
told
you
already
that
I
may
be
mistaken
time
will
show
however
Lisa
grew
thoughtful
Lavretsky
began
to
tell
her
about
his
daily
life
at
Vassilyevskoe
about
Mihalevitch
and
about
Anton
he
felt
a
need
to
talk
to
Lisa
to
share
with
her
everything
that
was
passing
in
his
heart
she
listened
so
sweetly
so
attentively
her
few
replies
and
observations
seemed
to
him
so
simple
and
so
intelligent
He
even
told
her
so
Lisa
was
surprised
Really
she
said
I
thought
that
I
was
like
my
maid
Nastya
I
had
no
words
of
my
own
She
said
one
day
to
her
sweetheart
You
must
be
dull
with
me
you
always
talk
so
finely
to
me
and
I
have
no
words
of
my
own
And
thank
God
for
it
thought
Lavretsky
Meanwhile
the
evening
had
come
on
