that
I
was
That
word
I
had
repeated
it
the
night
before
with
tears
I
had
flung
it
to
the
wind
I
had
said
it
over
and
over
again
among
the
empty
fields
but
I
did
not
say
it
to
her
I
did
not
tell
her
I
loved
her
Indeed
I
could
not
have
uttered
that
word
then
When
I
met
her
in
that
fatal
room
I
had
as
yet
no
clear
consciousness
of
my
love
it
had
not
fully
awakened
even
when
I
was
sitting
with
her
brother
in
senseless
and
burdensome
silence
it
flamed
up
with
irrepressible
force
only
a
few
instants
later
when
terrified
by
the
possibility
of
misfortune
I
began
to
seek
and
call
her
but
then
it
was
already
too
late
But
that
s
impossible
I
shall
be
told
I
don
t
know
whether
it
s
possible
I
know
that
it
s
the
truth
Acia
would
not
have
gone
away
if
there
had
been
the
faintest
shade
of
coquetry
in
her
and
if
her
position
had
not
been
a
false
one
She
could
not
put
up
with
what
any
other
girl
would
have
endured
I
did
not
realise
that
My
evil
genius
had
arrested
an
avowal
on
my
lips
at
my
last
interview
with
Gagin
at
the
darkened
window
and
the
last
thread
I
might
have
caught
at
had
slipped
out
of
my
fingers
The
same
day
I
went
back
with
my
portmanteau
packed
to
L
and
started
for
Cologne
I
remember
the
steamer
was
already
off
and
I
was
taking
a
mental
farewell
of
those
streets
all
those
spots
which
I
was
never
to
forget
when
I
caught
sight
of
Hannchen
She
was
sitting
on
a
seat
near
the
river
Her
face
was
pale
but
not
sad
a
handsome
young
fellow
was
standing
beside
her
laughing
and
telling
her
some
story
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
Rhine
my
little
Madonna
peeped
out
of
the
green
of
the
old
ash-tree
as
mournfully
as
ever
In
Cologne
I
came
upon
traces
of
the
Gagins
I
found
out
they
had
gone
to
London
I
pushed
on
in
pursuit
of
them
but
in
London
all
my
researches
were
in
vain
It
was
long
before
I
would
resign
myself
for
a
long
while
I
persevered
but
I
was
obliged
at
last
to
give
up
all
hope
of
coming
across
them
And
I
never
saw
them
again
I
never
saw
Acia
Vague
rumours
reached
me
about
him
but
she
had
vanished
for
ever
for
me
I
don
t
even
know
whether
she
is
alive
One
day
a
few
years
later
in
a
railway
carriage
abroad
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
woman
whose
face
vividly
recalled
those
features
I
could
never
forget
but
I
was
most
likely
deceived
by
a
chance
resemblance
Acia
remained
in
my
memory
a
little
girl
such
as
I
had
known
her
at
the
best
time
of
my
life
as
I
saw
her
the
last
time
leaning
against
the
back
of
a
low
wooden
chair
But
I
must
own
I
did
not
grieve
over-long
for
her
I
even
came
to
the
conclusion
that
fate
had
done
all
for
the
best
in
not
uniting
me
to
Acia
I
consoled
myself
with
the
reflection
that
I
should
probably
not
have
been
happy
with
such
a
wife
I
was
young
then
and
the
future
the
brief
swiftly-passing
future
seemed
boundless
to
me
then
Could
not
what
had
been
be
repeated
I
thought
and
better
fairer
still
I
got
to
know
other
women
but
the
feeling
Acia
had
aroused
in
me
that
intense
tender
deep
feeling
has
never
come
again
No
no
eyes
have
for
me
taken
the
place
of
those
that
were
once
turned
with
love
upon
my
eyes
to
no
heart
pressed
to
my
breast
has
my
heart
responded
with
such
joyous
sweet
emotion
Condemned
as
I
have
been
to
a
solitary
life
without
ties
or
family
I
have
led
a
dreary
existence
but
I
keep
as
sacred
relics
her
little
notes
and
the
dry
geranium
the
flower
she
threw
me
once
out
of
the
window
It
still
retains
a
faint
scent
while
the
hand
that
gave
it
the
hand
I
only
once
pressed
to
my
lips
has
perhaps
long
since
decayed
in
the
grave
And
I
myself
what
has
become
of
me
What
is
left
of
me
of
those
blissful
heart-stirring
days
of
those
winged
hopes
and
aspirations
The
faint
fragrance
of
an
insignificant
plant
outlives
all
man
s
joys
and
sorrows
outlives
man
himself
