and
you
will
not
take
into
consideration
that
he
who
gives
is
free
to
give
and
he
who
takes
to
take
Besides
I
have
not
acted
in
this
affair
on
my
own
initiative
Another
person
has
taken
the
principal
part
as
I
have
explained
Of
course
Mihey
Miheyitch
observed
ironically
the
fox
hid
under
the
harrow
from
the
rain
not
every
drop
would
fall
on
her
any
way
But
you
must
own
our
police
captain
gave
you
a
good
wigging
Eh
It
was
a
sound
one
The
threadbare
gentleman
winced
He
's
a
man
quick
to
come
down
on
you
he
said
at
last
with
hesitation
I
should
think
so
With
all
that
though
of
him
one
could
He
's
a
priceless
man
a
real
treasure
Mihey
Miheyitch
interrupted
him
addressing
Stepan
Petrovitch
for
dealing
with
these
fine
fellows
and
for
drunkards
too
he
's
a
giant
Braoo
Braoo
commented
Stepan
Petrov
itch
Verotchka
came
in
with
two
more
cups
of
coffee
on
a
tray
Mihey
Miheyitch
bowed
to
her
One
more
said
her
father
Why
do
you
take
all
this
trouble
yourself
Boris
Andreyitch
said
as
he
took
the
cup
from
her
It
's
no
trouble
answered
Verotchka
and
I
do
n't
want
to
leave
it
to
the
man
it
seems
to
me
it
will
be
nicer
so
Of
course
from
your
hands
But
Verotchka
did
not
hear
his
politeness
she
went
out
and
came
back
at
once
with
coffee
for
Mihey
Miheyitch
Have
you
heard
Mihey
Miheyitch
began
when
he
had
emptied
his
cup
Mavra
Ilyi
nitchna
is
lying
speechless
Stepan
Petrovitch
stopped
and
raised
his
head
Yes
yes
Mihey
Miheyitch
went
on
paralysis
You
know
how
fond
she
was
of
good
eating
Well
the
day
before
yesterday
she
was
sitting
at
table
and
visitors
with
her
they
served
cold
kvass
soup
and
she
had
just
had
two
platesful
and
asked
for
a
third
all
at
once
she
looked
round
and
said
like
this
without
any
haste
you
know
'Take
away
the
soup
all
the
people
are
green
and
fell
flop
off
her
chair
They
flew
to
pick
her
up
and
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
she
explained
with
her
hands
but
her
tongue
would
n't
work
They
say
our
district
apothe
cary
distinguished
himself
on
the
occasion
He
leapt
up
and
cried
A
doctor
Send
for
a
doctor
He
quite
lost
his
head
And
after
all
what
is
his
practice
He
simply
lives
on
dead
bodies
Bra-oo
Bra-oo
Barsukov
articulated
pen
sively
And
we
're
going
to
have
kvass
soup
to
day
observed
Verotchka
sitting
down
in
the
corner
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
What
with
with
sturgeon
Mihey
Mi
heyitch
asked
quickly
Yes
with
sturgeon
That
's
a
capital
thing
Here
they
say
kvass
soup
is
not
a
good
thing
in
winter
because
it's
a
cold
dish
That
's
nonsense
is
n't
it
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Absolute
nonsense
answered
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
Why
is
n't
it
warm
here
in
this
room
Very
warm
Then
why
should
n't
one
eat
a
cold
dish
in
a
warm
room
I
do
n't
understand
And
I
do
n't
understand
either
The
conversation
continued
for
a
good
while
in
this
style
The
master
of
the
house
took
hardly
any
part
in
it
and
kept
on
walking
about
the
room
At
dinner
everyone
did
very
well
indeed
everything
was
good
though
simply
prepared
Verotchka
sat
at
the
head
helped
the
kvass
soup
sent
round
the
dishes
watched
how
her
guests
were
getting
on
and
tried
to
anticipate
their
wants
tHE
TWO
FllIENDS
Vyazovnin
sat
beside
her
and
watched
her
intently
Verotchka
like
her
father
could
not
speak
without
smiling
and
that
was
very
becom
ing
to
her
Vyazovnin
addressed
her
from
time
to
time
with
a
question
not
for
the
sake
of
get
ting
any
answer
from
her
but
merely
to
see
that
smile
After
dinner
Mihey
Miheyitch
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
and
the
gentleman
awaiting
his
trial
whose
name
was
Onufry
Ilyitch
sat
down
to
play
cards
Mihey
Miheyitch
did
not
again
speak
so
cruelly
of
him
though
he
con
tinued
to
banter
him
possibly
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
Mihey
Miheyitch
had
had
a
drop
too
much
at
dinner
He
did
it
is
true
de
clare
at
every
deal
that
all
the
aces
and
trumps
would
be
sure
to
be
Onufry
's
that
that
nettle
seed
would
have
some
dodge
in
shuffling
that
his
hands
were
made
for
plunder
but
on
the
other
hand
after
they
had
w^on
a
game
together
Mihey
Miheyitch
quite
unexpectedly
praised
him
Well
say
what
you
like
you
're
a
bad
lot
of
course
but
'pon
my
soul
I
like
you
in
the
first
place
because
that
's
my
temperament
and
in
the
second
because
if
one
comes
to
think
The
two
friene
s
and
other
stories
of
it
there
are
plenty
worse
than
you
and
in
deed
one
may
say
that
in
your
own
way
you're
a
decent
fellow
You
're
pleased
to
tell
the
truth
Mihey
Mi
heyitch
replied
Onufry
Ilyitch
greatly
en
couraged
by
these
words
The
holy
truth
only
persecution
of
course
Come
deal
deal
Mihey
Miheyitch
inter
rupted
him
Persecution
indeed
What
per
secution
Thank
God
you
're
not
sitting
in
the
Pugatchev
tower
in
chains
Deal
And
Onufry
Ilyitch
proceeded
to
deal
rap
idly
winking
his
eyes
and
still
more
rapidly
moistening
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
with
his
long
thin
tongue
Meanwhile
Stepan
Petrovitch
was
walking
about
the
room
while
Boris
Andreyitch
kept
near
Verotchka
The
conversation
between
them
was
fragmentary
she
was
continually
going
out
and
so
in
significant
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
repro
duce
it
He
asked
her
who
lived
in
their
neigh
bourhood
whether
she
often
went
out
visiting
whether
she
liked
keeping
house
To
the
ques
tion
what
she
was
reading
she
answered
I
ought
to
read
but
I
've
no
time
And
yet
when
at
nightfall
a
boy
came
into
the
study
announc
ing
that
their
horses
were
ready
he
was
sorry
to
be
going
away
sorry
not
to
go
on
seeing
those
kind
eyes
that
bright
smile
If
Stepan
Petrovitch
had
thought
fit
to
ask
him
he
would
certainly
have
stayed
the
night
but
Stepan
Petrovitch
did
not
do
so
not
because
he
was
not
pleased
with
his
new
visitor
but
because
his
rule
was
that
if
anyone
wanted
to
stay
the
night
he
gave
orders
at
once
himself
that
a
bed
should
be
prepared
for
him
Mihey
Miheyitch
and
Onufry
Ilyitch
did
so
they
even
slept
in
the
same
room
and
talked
long
after
midnight
Their
voices
were
dimly
audible
from
the
study
Onufry
Ilyitch
talked
most
and
seemed
to
be
telling
some
story
or
trying
to
prove
some
thing
while
his
companion
merely
uttered
at
intervals
sometimes
in
a
dubious
sometimes
in
an
approving
tone
H
'm
Next
morning
they
drove
away
together
to
Mihey
Miheyitch's
estate
and
from
there
to
the
town
also
together
On
their
way
home
Boris
Andreyitch
and
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
were
for
a
long
time
silent
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
even
dropped
asleep
lulled
by
the
tinkling
of
the
bell
and
the
even
mo
tion
of
the
sledge
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Boris
Andreyitch
said
at
last
Well
said
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
half
asleep
Why
is
it
you
do
n't
question
me
Question
you
about
what
Why
as
you
did
the
other
times
About
Verotchka
do
you
mean
Yes
So
that
's
what
you
're
after
Do
you
sup
pose
I
meant
her
for
you
She
's
not
fit
for
you
You
're
wrong
in
thinking
that
I
like
her
far
better
than
all
your
Emerentsiyas
and
Sofya
Kirillovnas
What
do
you
mean
What
I
tell
you
But
come
now
really
She
's
quite
a
sim
ple
girl
She
may
be
a
good
housekeeper
it's
true
but
that
's
not
what
you
want
you
know
Why
not
Perhaps
that
's
just
what
I'm
looking
for
What
are
you
talking
about
Boris
An
dreyitch
Upon
my
word
Why
she
doesn't
speak
French
at
all
What
of
it
Do
you
suppose
one
ca
n't
do
without
French
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
was
silent
for
a
space
I
had
n't
expected
this
at
all
from
you
that
is
I
believe
you
are
joking
No
I
'm
not
joking
God
knows
what
to
make
of
you
then
Why
I
thought
she
was
only
suited
for
a
fel
low
like
me
However
she
really
is
a
first
rate
girl
And
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
straightened
his
cap
thrust
his
head
into
the
pillow
and
fell
asleep
Boris
Andreyitch
went
on
thinking
about
Verotchka
He
was
haunted
by
her
smile
by
the
good-humoured
mildness
of
her
eyes
The
night
was
light
and
cold
the
snow
glistened
with
blue
gleams
Hke
diamonds
the
sky
was
spangled
with
stars
and
the
pleiades
twinkled
brightly
the
frost
crunched
and
crackled
un
der
the
runners
the
twigs
on
the
trees
cov
ered
with
icy
hoarfrost
faintly
tinkled
glitter
ing
in
the
moonlight
as
though
they
were
made
of
glass
At
such
a
time
the
imagination
works
eagerly
Vyazovnin
experienced
this
He
pondered
all
sorts
of
things
before
the
sledge
stopped
at
last
at
his
steps
but
the
image
of
Verotchka
never
left
his
brain
and
secretly
accompanied
his
dreams
As
we
have
mentioned
already
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
was
surprised
at
the
impression
Ve
rotchka
had
made
on
Boris
Andreyitch
but
he
was
still
more
surprised
two
days
later
when
his
friend
announced
that
he
meant
to
go
to
Barsukov
's
and
that
he
should
go
alone
if
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
were
not
disposed
to
accompany
him
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
replied
of
course
that
he
was
ready
and
delighted
and
the
friends
drove
off
to
Barsukov
's
again
and
again
spent
the
whole
day
there
As
on
the
first
occasion
they
found
several
visitors
whom
Verotchka
re
galed
with
coffee
and
after
dinner
with
jam
but
Vyazovnin
had
more
conversation
with
her
than
on
the
first
visit
that
is
he
talked
more
to
her
He
told
her
about
his
past
life
about
Petersburg
about
his
travels
in
fact
about
anything
that
came
into
his
head
She
listened
to
him
with
quiet
interest
continually
smiling
and
looking
at
him
but
never
for
a
moment
forgot
her
duties
as
a
hostess
she
got
up
at
once
as
soon
as
she
noticed
that
her
visitors
needed
anything
and
brought
them
everything
herself
When
she
went
away
Vyazovnin
looked
placidly
about
him
and
did
not
leave
his
seat
she
came
back
sat
down
beside
him
and
took
up
her
work
and
he
entered
into
conver
sation
with
her
again
Stepan
Petrovitch
would
go
up
to
them
listen
to
Vyazovnin
's
remarks
and
mutter
Bra-oo
Bra-oo
and
the
hours
simply
raced
by
This
time
the
two
friends
stayed
the
night
and
only
went
home
late
in
the
evening
of
the
following
day
At
parting
Vyazovnin
pressed
Verotchka's
hand
She
flushed
a
little
No
man
had
ever
pressed
her
hand
till
that
day
but
she
thought
that
that
was
what
they
did
in
Petersburg
The
two
friends
began
going
frequently
to
see
Stepan
Petrovitch
and
Boris
Andreyitch
in
particular
became
quite
at
home
in
his
house
At
times
he
had
a
great
craving
an
intense
longing
to
be
there
On
several
occasions
he
went
alone
He
liked
Verotchka
more
and
more
already
a
friendship
had
arisen
between
them
already
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
i
she
was
tcM
cool
and
reasonable
a
friend
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
left
off
speaking
to
him
of
Verotchka
but
one
morning
after
loo'king
at
him
as
usual
for
some
time
without
speak
ing
he
brought
out
significantly
Boris
Andreyitch
Well
replied
Boris
Andreyitch
and
he
coloured
a
little
though
he
could
not
say
why
There
is
something
I
wanted
to
say
to
you
Boris
Andreyitch
Mind
you
do
n't
er
it
would
be
bad
you
know
if
anything
for
instance
What
do
you
mean
said
Boris
Andreyitch
I
do
n't
understand
you
Why
about
Verotchka
About
Verotchka
And
Boris
Andreyitch
flushed
redder
Yes
Take
care
you
know
harm
is
soon
done
Wrong
that
is
excuse
my
openness
but
I
imagine
it
's
my
duty
as
a
friend
But
where
did
you
get
that
idea
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
Boris
Andreyitch
interrupted
him
Verotchka
's
a
girl
of
the
strictest
principles
and
besides
there
's
nothing
between
us
but
the
most
ordinary
friendship
Oh
nonsense
Boris
Andreyitch
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
retorted
in
his
turn
How
can
a
cultivated
man
like
you
have
a
friendship
with
a
country
girl
who
has
never
been
outside
her
own
four
walls
You
're
at
that
again
Boris
Andreyitch
in
terrupted
him
for
the
second
time
What
you
drag
culture
in
for
I
ca
n't
imagine
Boris
Andreyitch
was
a
little
irritated
Well
listen
anyway
Boris
Andreyitch
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
said
impatiently
Since
it's
come
to
this
I
must
tell
you
you
have
a
per
fect
right
to
be
reserved
with
me
but
as
for
deceiving
me
excuse
me
you
do
n't
I
have
eyes
too
Yesterday
they
had
been
together
at
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
the
evening
before
re
vealed
a
great
deal
to
me
And
what
precisely
did
it
reveal
to
you
asked
Boris
Andreyitch
It
revealed
to
me
that
you
love
her
and
are
even
jealous
over
her
Vyazovnin
looked
at
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Well
and
does
she
love
me
That
I
ca
n't
say
for
certain
but
it
would
be
strange
if
she
did
n't
love
you
Because
I
'm
cultivated
you
mean
to
say
Both
because
of
that
and
because
you
are
well
off
And
your
appearance
is
attractive
too
but
the
property
is
the
chief
thing
Vyazovnin
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
How
could
you
see
that
I
was
jealous
he
suddenly
asked
turning
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
Why
you
were
not
like
yourself
yesterday
till
that
scamp
Karantyev
had
gone
Vyazovnin
made
no
answer
but
in
his
soul
he
felt
that
his
friend
had
spoken
the
truth
This
Karantyev
was
a
student
who
had
not
completed
his
studies
a
good-humoured
fel
low
not
without
intelligence
and
feeling
but
utterly
nonsensical
and
hopelessly
ruined
His
powers
had
been
dissipated
by
his
passions
in
early
youth
he
had
been
left
too
young
without
guardianship
He
had
a
reckless
gipsy
face
and
was
altogether
like
a
gipsy
singing
and
dancing
like
one
He
fell
in
love
with
every
woman
he
met
Verotchka
attracted
him
very
much
Boris
Andreyitch
had
made
his
ac
quaintance
at
Barsukov
's
and
had
at
first
been
very
well
disposed
towards
him
but
on
one
occasion
observing
the
peculiar
expression
of
face
with
which
Verotchka
listened
to
his
sing
ing
he
began
to
feel
differently
about
him
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
said
Boris
Andreyitch
going
up
to
his
friend
and
standing
facing
him
I
ought
to
own
I
believe
you're
right
I
have
felt
it
for
a
long
time
but
you
have
completely
opened
my
eyes
I
certainly
am
not
indifferent
to
Verotchka
but
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
what
of
it
She
and
I
both
of
us
want
nothing
dishonourable
besides
as
I've
told
you
already
I
see
no
special
signs
on
her
part
of
a
liking
for
me
Quite
so
replied
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
but
the
Evil
One
is
powerful
Boris
Andreyitch
was
silent
for
a
while
What
am
I
to
do
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
What
are
you
to
do
Give
up
going
there
You
think
so
Of
course
You
're
not
going
to
marry
her
Vyazovnin
was
silent
for
a
space
again
And
why
should
n't
I
marry
her
he
ex
claimed
at
last
i
I
've
told
you
why
already
Boris
An
dreyitch
she
's
not
a
match
for
you
I
do
n't
see
that
Well
if
you
do
n't
see
it
do
as
you
think
best
I
'm
not
your
guardian
And
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
began
filling
his
pipe
Boris
Andreyitch
sat
in
the
window
and
sank
into
thought
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
did
not
inter
rupt
his
musings
but
with
great
composure
puffed
little
clouds
of
smoke
from
his
lips
At
last
Boris
Andreyitch
got
up
and
with
notice
able
excitement
ordered
his
carriage
Where
to
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
asked
him
To
the
Barsukovs
Boris
Andreyitch
an
swered
abruptly
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
puffed
half
a
dozen
times
Am
I
to
go
with
you
or
what
No
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
I
should
like
to
go
alone
to-day
I
want
to
come
to
an
understand
ing
with
Verotchka
herself
You
know
best
So
he
said
to
himself
as
he
saw
Boris
Andreyitch
out
this
is
how
a
joke
has
turned
to
earnest
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
and
all
through
idleness
he
added
as
he
set
tled
himself
on
the
sofa
On
the
evening
of
the
same
day
Pyotr
Vas
silyitch
who
had
gone
home
without
awaiting
his
friend
's
return
was
just
going
to
bed
when
all
at
once
Boris
Andreyitch
covered
with
pow
dery
snow
dashed
into
his
room
and
threw
himself
on
his
neck
My
friend
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
congratulate
me
he
exclaimed
She
has
accepted
me
and
the
old
man
has
given
his
consent
too
It's
all
settled
How
's
that
What
do
you
mean
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
muttered
in
astonishment
I
'm
going
to
get
married
To
Verotchka
Yes
It
's
all
settled
and
arranged
It
ca
n't
be
What
a
man
you
are
I
tell
you
it
's
all
settled
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
hurriedly
slid
his
bare
feet
into
slippers
flung
on
his
dressing
gown
and
shouted
Makedoniya
tea
and
added
Well
since
it
's
all
settled
it
's
no
use
talking
about
it
God
give
you
concord
and
counsel
But
please
tell
me
how
it
all
happened
With
pleasure
if
you
like
answered
Vyazovnin
and
began
telling
him
This
was
how
it
really
had
happened
When
Boris
Andreyitch
had
arrived
at
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
the
latter
contrary
to
his
usual
habit
had
no
visitor
with
him
and
was
not
walking
up
and
down
the
room
but
was
sit
ting
in
an
invalid
chair
he
was
not
very
well
When
this
was
the
case
he
gave
up
talking
altogether
and
so
he
merely
gave
Vyazovnin
a
friendly
nod
first
pointing
him
to
the
table
with
food
on
it
and
then
to
Verotchka
and
closed
his
eyes
This
was
all
Vyazovnin
wanted
he
sat
down
by
Verotchka
and
began
talking
to
her
in
a
low
voice
They
spoke
of
Stepan
Petrovitch's
heakh
I
'm
always
frightened
Verotchka
said
in
a
whisper
when
he
is
unwell
You
know
what
he
is
he
does
n't
complain
does
n't
ask
for
anything
you
ca
n't
get
a
word
out
of
him
He
'll
be
ill
and
say
nothing
'And
you
love
him
very
much
Vyazovnin
asked
her
Whom
Father
Yes
more
than
anyone
in
the
world
God
preserve
us
from
anything
happening
to
him
I
beheve
I
should
die
Then
it
would
be
impossible
for
you
to
part
from
him
Part
What
should
I
part
from
him
for
Boris
Andreyitch
looked
into
her
face
A
girl
ca
n't
live
all
her
life
in
her
father's
house
Ah
I
see
what
you
mean
Well
I
needn't
trouble
then
Who
would
have
me
I
Boris
Andreyitch
was
almost
saying
but
he
restrained
himself
What
are
you
thinking
she
asked
looking
at
him
with
her
habitual
smile
I
think
he
replied
I
think
that
And
suddenly
changing
his
tune
he
asked
her
how
long
she
had
known
Karantyev
I
really
do
n't
remember
You
see
so
many
of
them
come
to
see
father
I
believe
he
came
to
see
us
for
the
first
time
last
year
Tell
me
do
you
like
him
No
answered
Verotchka
after
a
moment's
thought
Why
not
He
's
so
untidy
she
answered
simply
But
he
must
be
a
good
fellow
and
he
sings
so
splendidly
It
stirs
one
's
heart
when
he
sings
Ah
Vyazovnin
commented
and
after
a
brief
pause
he
added
Whom
do
you
like
then
I
like
a
great
many
people
I
like
you
You
and
I
are
friends
we
know
but
is
there
no
one
you
like
more
than
the
rest
How
inquisitive
you
are
And
you
are
very
cold
How
so
Verotchka
asked
naively
Listen
Vyazovnin
was
beginning
But
at
that
instant
Stepan
Petrovitch
turned
in
his
chair
Listen
he
went
on
hardly
audibly
while
the
blood
seemed
to
be
throbbing
in
his
throat
There
is
something
I
must
say
to
you
very
important
only
not
here
Where
then
Why
in
the
next
room
for
instance
What
is
it
A
secret
then
said
Ve
rotchka
getting
up
Yes
a
secret
A
secret
repeated
Verotchka
wonderingly
and
she
went
into
the
next
room
Vyazovnin
followed
her
as
though
in
a
fever
Well
what
is
it
she
asked
him
with
curiosity
Boris
Andreyitch
meant
to
lead
up
to
the
subject
but
glancing
at
that
youthful
face
beaming
with
the
faint
smile
which
he
so
loved
at
those
clear
eyes
gazing
at
him
with
such
a
soft
look
he
lost
his
head
and
quite
to
his
own
surprise
asked
Verotchka
bluntly
without
any
preliminary
Vera
Stepanovna
will
you
be
my
wife
What
said
Verotchka
turning
hot
all
over
and
flushing
crimson
to
her
ears
Will
you
be
my
wife
Vyazovnin
repeated
mechanically
I
I
really
do
n't
know
I
did
n't
expect
it
's
so
whispered
Verotchka
stretch
ing
out
her
hand
to
the
window-sill
to
steady
herself
and
all
at
once
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
into
her
bedroom
Boris
Andreyitch
remained
standing
where
he
was
for
a
little
while
then
in
great
con
fusion
went
back
to
the
study
On
the
table
lay
a
number
of
the
Moscow
News
He
took
it
up
and
began
looking
at
the
printed
lines
not
only
without
understanding
what
was
in
them
but
even
without
any
idea
of
what
was
happening
to
him
generally
He
spent
a
quar
ter
of
an
hour
in
this
condition
but
all
at
once
there
was
a
faint
rustle
behind
him
and
with
out
looking
round
he
felt
that
Verotchka
had
come
in
A
few
more
moments
passed
he
stole
a
glance
at
her
from
behind
the
pages
of
the
Moscow
News
She
was
sitting
in
the
window
turned
away
from
him
and
she
looked
pale
At
last
he
plucked
up
courage
and
got
up
went
to
her
and
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
her
Stepan
Petrovitch
did
not
stir
sitting
in
his
low
chair
with
his
head
thrown
back
Forgive
me
Vera
Stepanovna
Vyaaovnin
began
with
some
effort
I
am
to
blame
I
ought
not
so
suddenly
and
besides
I
had
of
course
no
grounds
Verotchka
made
no
answer
But
since
it
has
happened
like
this
Boris
Andreyitch
went
on
'1
should
like
to
know
what
answer
Verotchka
gently
bowed
her
head
her
cheeks
flushed
again
Vera
Stepanovna
one
word
I
do
n't
know
really
she
began
Boris
Andreyitch
it
depends
on
father
Unwell
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
voice
asked
suddenly
4
Verotchka
started
and
quickly
raised
her
head
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
eyes
fastened
upon
her
expressed
uneasiness
She
went
up
to
him
at
once
You
are
asking
me
something
father
Feeling
unwell
he
repeated
Who
I
No
What
makes
you
think
so
He
looked
at
her
intently
Really
quite
well
he
asked
once
more
Of
course
how
do
you
feel
Braoo
Bra-oo
he
said
softly
and
closed
his
eyes
again
Verotchka
turned
towards
the
door
Boris
Andreyitch
stopped
her
Tell
me
anyway
do
you
allow
me
to
speak
to
your
father
If
you
like
she
whispered
only
Boris
Andreyitch
I
think
I
am
not
a
match
for
you
Boris
Andreyitch
would
have
taken
her
hand
but
she
evaded
him
and
went
away
Strange
he
thought
She
says
exactly
the
same
thing
as
Krupitsyn
Left
alone
with
Stepan
Petrovitch
Boris
An
dreyitch
vowed
to
explain
things
more
sen
sibly
to
him
and
as
far
as
possible
to
prepare
him
for
the
unexpected
proposal
but
his
task
turned
out
in
reality
even
more
difficult
than
speaking
to
Verotchka
Stepan
Petrovitch
was
a
little
feverish
and
in
a
state
between
brooding
and
dozing
He
made
reluctant
and
tardy
answers
to
the
vari
ous
questions
and
observations
by
means
of
which
Boris
Andreyitch
hoped
gradually
to
lead
up
to
the
real
subject
of
the
conversa
tion
In
short
Boris
Andreyitch
seeing
that
his
hints
were
being
thrown
away
was
compelled
to
approach
the
subject
directly
Several
times
he
took
breath
as
though
pre
paring
to
speak
stopped
short
and
did
not
utter
a
word
Stepan
Petrovitch
he
began
at
last
I
in
tend
to
make
you
a
proposal
that
will
surprise
you
very
much
Bra-oo
Bra-oo
Stepan
Petrovitch
replied
calmly
A
proposal
which
you
do
not
expect
in
the
least
Stepan
Petrovitch
opened
his
eyes
Only
please
do
n't
be
angry
with
me
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
eyes
opened
more
widely
I
I
intend
to
ask
you
for
the
hand
of
your
daughter
Vera
Stepanovna
Stepan
Petrovitch
got
up
quickly
from
his
invalid
chair
What
he
asked
in
exactly
the
same
voice
and
with
the
same
expression
of
face
as
Verotchka
Boris
Andreyitch
was
compelled
to
repeat
his
proposal
Stepan
Petrovitch
fixed
His
eyes
on
Vyazov
nin
and
looked
at
him
a
long
time
in
silence
so
that
at
last
he
felt
awkward
tHE
TWO
FRIENDS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
Does
Vera
know
Stepan
Petrovitch
asked
I
have
spoken
to
Vera
Stepanovna
and
she
has
allowed
me
to
address
myself
to
you
Were
you
speaking
to
her
just
now
Yes
Just
now
Wait
a
minute
Stepan
Petrovitch
articu
lated
and
he
went
out
Boris
Andreyitch
was
left
alone
in
the
queer
old
man
's
study
In
a
state
of
stupor
he
gazed
first
at
the
walls
and
then
at
the
floor
when
suddenly
there
was
a
sound
of
horse
's
hoofs
at
the
steps
the
front
door
banged
A
thick
voice
asked
At
home
Steps
were
heard
and
Mihey
Miheyitch
al
ready
known
to
the
reader
walked
swaying
into
the
study
Boris
Andreyitch
was
ready
to
die
with
vexation
How
warm
it
is
in
here
exclaimed
Mihey
ISIiheyitch
dropping
onto
the
sofa
Ah
how
do
you
do
And
where
's
Stepan
Petrovitch
He
's
just
gone
out
he
'll
be
back
directly
It
's
awfully
cold
to-day
observed
Mihey
Miheyitch
pouring
himself
out
a
glass
of
vodka
And
scarcely
giving
himself
time
to
swallow
it
he
added
briskly
I
've
come
from
the
town
again
you
know
From
the
town
repeated
Vyazovnin
con
cealing
his
emotion
with
difficulty
From
the
town
repeated
Mihey
Miheyitch
and
all
thanks
to
that
brigand
Onufry
Only
fancy
he
told
me
no
end
of
tales
held
out
such
alluring
prospects
that
it
made
one
's
mouth
water
'I
have
found
an
investment
for
you
says
he
'like
nothing
else
in
the
world
You've
simply
to
rake
the
shekels
in
by
hundreds
and
the
whole
thing
ended
in
his
borrowing
twenty-five
roubles
from
me
and
my
dragging
myself
off
to
the
town
for
nothing
I
quite
knocked
up
my
horses
You
do
n't
say
so
muttered
Vyazovnin
I
tell
you
he
's
a
brigand
a
brigand
if
ever
there
was
one
He
might
as
well
be
a
high
wayman
with
a
bludgeon
I
really
do
n't
know
what
the
police
are
about
If
he
goes
on
like
this
he
will
leave
me
without
a
half-penny
upon
my
soul
Stepan
Petrovitch
came
into
the
room
Mihey
Miheyitch
began
describing
his
adven
tures
with
Onufry
And
why
is
it
somebody
does
n't
give
him
a
good
hiding
he
exclaimed
Does
n't
give
him
a
hiding
repeated
Stepan
Petrovitch
and
he
suddenly
went
off
into
a
peal
of
laughter
Mihey
Miheyitch
laughed
too
looking
at
him
and
even
repeat
ing
Precisely
he
ought
to
have
a
good
hiding
But
when
Stepan
Petrovitch
fell
on
the
sofa
in
paroxysms
of
hysterical
laughter
Mihey
Miheyitch
turned
to
Boris
Andreyitch
and
turn
ing
up
the
palms
of
his
hands
commented
There
he
is
always
like
that
bursts
out
laugh
ing
the
Lord
only
knows
what
at
That
's
his
whimsy
Verotchka
came
in
looking
agitated
and
with
red
eyes
Papa
's
not
quite
well
to-day
she
observed
in
an
undertone
to
Mihey
Miheyitch
Mihey
Miheyitch
nodded
and
put
a
piece
of
cheese
into
his
mouth
At
last
Stepan
Petrov
itch
left
off
laughing
got
up
heaved
a
sigh
and
began
walking
about
the
room
Boris
Andreyitch
avoided
his
eyes
and
sat
as
though
on
thorns
Mihey
Iiheyitch
fell
to
abusing
Onufry
Ilyitch
again
They
had
dinner
at
dinner
too
Mihey
Mi
heyitch
was
the
only
one
who
talked
it
was
almost
evening
when
Stepan
Petrovitch
took
Boris
Andreyitch
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
into
the
other
room
You
are
a
good
man
he
asked
looking
into
his
face
I
am
an
honest
man
Stepan
Petrovitch
replied
Boris
Andreyitch
that
I
can
answer
for
and
I
love
your
daughter
You
love
her
Really
I
love
her
and
will
try
to
deserve
her
love
You
wo
n't
get
tired
of
her
Stepan
Petrov
itch
asked
again
Never
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
face
contracted
with
a
look
of
pain
Well
mind
love
her
I
con
sent
Boris
Andreyitch
would
have
embraced
him
but
he
said
Afterwards
that
's
all
right
and
turning
away
he
moved
to
the
wall
Boris
Andreyitch
could
see
that
he
was
crying
Stepan
Petrovitch
wiped
his
eyes
without
turning
round
then
went
back
to
the
study
passing
Boris
Andreyitch
and
without
looking
at
him
said
with
his
habitual
smile
Please
no
more
to-day
to-morrow
all
that
's
necessary
Certainly
certainly
Boris
Andreyitch
hur
riedly
assured
him
and
following
him
into
the
study
exchanged
a
glance
with
Verotchka
There
was
joy
in
his
soul
but
at
the
same
time
some
disquietude
He
could
not
remain
longer
at
Stepan
Petrovitch
's
in
the
society
of
Mihey
Miheyitch
he
felt
he
must
be
alone
besides
he
longed
to
tell
Pyotr
Vassilyitch
He
went
away
promising
to
come
back
next
day
As
he
said
good-bye
to
Verotchka
he
kissed
her
hand
She
looked
at
him
Till
to-morrow
he
said
to
her
Good-bye
she
answered
softly
Do
you
