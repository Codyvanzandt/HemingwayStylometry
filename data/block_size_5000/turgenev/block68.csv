like
so
many
great
works
of
art
holds
depths
of
meaning
which
at
first
sight
lie
veiled
under
the
simplicity
and
harmony
of
the
technique
To
the
English
reader
On
the
Eve
is
a
charmingly
drawn
picture
of
a
quiet
Russian
household
with
a
delicate
analysis
of
a
young
girl
s
soul
but
to
Russians
it
is
also
a
deep
and
penetrating
diagnosis
of
the
destinies
of
the
Russia
of
the
fifties
Elena
the
Russian
girl
is
the
central
figure
of
the
novel
In
comparing
her
with
Turgenev
s
other
women
the
reader
will
remark
that
he
is
allowed
to
come
into
closer
spiritual
contact
with
her
than
even
with
Lisa
The
successful
portraits
of
women
drawn
by
men
in
fiction
are
generally
figures
for
the
imagination
to
play
on
however
much
that
is
told
to
one
about
them
the
secret
springs
of
their
character
are
left
a
little
obscure
but
when
Elena
stands
before
us
we
know
all
the
innermost
secrets
of
her
character
Her
strength
of
will
her
serious
courageous
proud
soul
her
capacity
for
passion
all
the
play
of
her
delicate
idealistic
nature
troubled
by
the
contradictions
aspirations
and
unhappiness
that
the
dawn
of
love
brings
to
her
all
this
is
conveyed
to
us
by
the
simplest
and
the
most
consummate
art
The
diary
chapter
xvi
that
Elena
keeps
is
in
itself
a
masterly
revelation
of
a
young
girl
s
heart
it
has
never
been
equalled
by
any
other
novelist
How
exquisitely
Turgenev
reveals
his
characters
may
be
seen
by
an
examination
of
the
parts
Shubin
the
artist
and
Bersenyev
the
student
play
towards
Elena
Both
young
men
are
in
love
with
her
and
the
description
of
their
after
relations
as
friends
and
the
feelings
of
Elena
towards
them
and
her
own
self-communings
are
interwoven
with
unfaltering
skill
All
the
most
complex
and
baffling
shades
of
the
mental
life
which
in
the
hands
of
many
latter-day
novelists
build
up
characters
far
too
thin
and
too
unconvincing
in
the
hands
of
Turgenev
are
used
with
deftness
and
certainty
to
bring
to
light
that
great
kingdom
which
is
always
lying
hidden
beneath
the
surface
beneath
the
common-place
of
daily
life
In
the
difficult
art
of
literary
perspective
in
the
effective
grouping
of
contrasts
in
character
and
the
criss-cross
of
the
influence
of
the
different
individuals
lies
the
secret
of
Turgenev
s
supremacy
As
an
example
the
reader
may
note
how
he
is
made
to
judge
Elena
through
six
pairs
of
eyes
Her
father
s
contempt
for
his
daughter
her
mother
s
affectionate
bewilderment
Shubin
s
petulant
criticism
Bersenyev
s
half
hearted
enthralment
Insarov
s
recognition
and
Zoya
s
indifference
being
the
facets
for
converging
light
on
Elena
s
sincerity
and
depth
of
soul
Again
one
may
note
Turgenev
s
method
for
rehabilitating
Shubin
in
our
eyes
Shubin
is
simply
made
to
criticise
Stahov
the
thing
is
done
in
a
few
seemingly
careless
lines
but
these
lines
lay
bare
Shubin
s
strength
and
weakness
the
fluidity
of
his
nature
The
reader
who
does
not
see
the
art
which
underlies
almost
every
line
of
On
the
Eve
is
merely
paying
the
highest
tribute
to
that
art
as
often
the
clear
waters
of
a
pool
conceal
its
surprising
depth
Taking
Shubin
s
character
as
an
example
of
creative
skill
we
can
not
call
to
mind
any
instance
in
the
range
of
European
fiction
where
the
typical
artist
mind
on
its
lighter
sides
has
been
analysed
with
such
delicacy
and
truth
as
here
by
Turgenev
Hawthorne
and
others
have
treated
it
but
the
colour
seems
to
fade
from
their
artist
characters
when
a
comparison
is
made
between
them
and
Shubin
And
yet
Turgenev
s
is
but
a
sketch
of
an
artist
compared
with
let
us
say
the
admirable
figure
of
Roderick
Hudson
The
irresponsibility
alertness
the
whimsicality
and
mobility
of
Shubin
combine
to
charm
and
irritate
the
reader
in
the
exact
proportion
that
such
a
character
affects
him
in
actual
life
there
is
not
the
least
touch
of
exaggeration
and
all
the
values
are
kept
to
a
marvel
Looking
at
the
minor
characters
perhaps
one
may
say
that
the
husband
Stahov
will
be
the
most
suggestive
and
not
the
least
familiar
character
to
English
households
His
essentially
masculine
meanness
his
self-complacency
his
unconscious
indifference
to
the
opinion
of
others
his
absurdity
as
un
pere
de
famille
is
balanced
by
the
foolish
affection
and
jealousy
which
his
wife
Anna
Vassilyevna
can
not
help
feeling
towards
him
The
perfect
balance
and
duality
of
Turgenev
s
outlook
is
here
shown
by
the
equal
cleverness
with
which
he
seizes
on
and
quietly
derides
the
typical
masculine
and
typical
feminine
attitude
in
such
a
married
life
as
the
two
Stahovs
Turning
to
the
figure
of
the
Bulgarian
hero
it
is
interesting
to
find
from
the
Souvenirs
sur
Tourguenev
published
in
1887
that
Turgenev
s
only
distinct
failure
of
importance
in
character
drawing
Insarov
was
not
taken
from
life
but
was
the
legacy
of
a
friend
Karateieff
who
implored
Turgenev
to
work
out
an
unfinished
conception
Insarov
is
a
figure
of
wood
He
is
so
cleverly
constructed
and
the
central
idea
behind
him
is
so
strong
that
his
wooden
joints
move
naturally
and
the
spectator
has
only
the
instinct
not
the
certainty
of
being
cheated
The
idea
he
incarnates
that
of
a
man
whose
soul
is
aflame
with
patriotism
is
finely
suggested
but
an
idea
even
a
great
one
does
not
make
an
individuality
And
in
fact
Insarov
is
not
a
man
he
is
an
automaton
To
compare
Shubin
s
utterances
with
his
is
to
perceive
that
there
is
no
spontaneity
no
inevitability
in
Insarov
He
is
a
patriotic
clock
wound
up
to
go
for
the
occasion
and
in
truth
he
is
very
useful
Only
on
his
deathbed
when
the
unexpected
happens
and
the
machinery
runs
down
do
we
feel
moved
Then
he
appears
more
striking
dead
than
alive
a
rather
damning
testimony
to
the
power
Turgenev
credits
him
with
This
artistic
failure
of
Turgenev
s
is
as
he
no
doubt
recognised
curiously
lessened
by
the
fact
that
young
girls
of
Elena
s
lofty
idealistic
type
are
particularly
impressed
by
certain
stiff
types
of
men
of
action
and
great
will-power
whose
capacity
for
moving
straight
towards
a
certain
goal
by
no
means
implies
corresponding
brain-power
The
insight
of
a
Shubin
and
the
moral
worth
of
a
Bersenyev
are
not
so
valuable
to
the
Elenas
of
this
world
whose
ardent
desire
to
be
made
good
use
of
and
to
seek
some
great
end
is
best
developed
by
strength
of
aim
in
the
men
they
love
And
now
to
see
what
the
novel
before
us
means
to
the
Russian
mind
we
must
turn
to
the
infinitely
suggestive
background
Turgenev
s
genius
was
of
the
same
force
in
politics
as
in
art
it
was
that
of
seeing
aright
He
saw
his
country
as
it
was
with
clearer
eyes
than
any
man
before
or
since
If
Tolstoi
is
a
purer
native
expression
of
Russia
s
force
Turgenev
is
the
personification
of
Russian
aspiration
working
with
the
instruments
of
wide
cosmopolitan
culture
As
a
critic
of
his
countrymen
nothing
escaped
Turgenev
s
eye
as
a
politician
he
foretold
nearly
all
that
actually
came
to
pass
in
his
life
and
as
a
consummate
artist
led
first
and
foremost
by
his
love
for
his
art
his
novels
are
undying
historical
pictures
It
is
not
that
there
is
anything
allegorical
in
his
novels
allegory
is
at
the
furthest
pole
from
his
method
it
is
that
whenever
he
created
an
important
figure
in
fiction
that
figure
is
necessarily
a
revelation
of
the
secrets
of
the
fatherland
the
soil
the
race
Turgenev
in
short
was
a
psychologist
not
merely
of
men
but
of
nations
and
so
the
chief
figure
of
On
the
Eve
Elena
foreshadows
and
stands
for
the
rise
of
young
Russia
in
the
sixties
Elena
is
young
Russia
and
to
whom
does
she
turn
in
her
prayer
for
strength
Not
to
Bersenyev
the
philosopher
the
dreamer
not
to
Shubin
the
man
carried
outside
himself
by
every
passing
distraction
but
to
the
strong
man
Insarov
And
here
the
irony
of
Insarov
being
made
a
foreigner
a
Bulgarian
is
significant
of
Turgenev
s
distrust
of
his
country
s
weakness
The
hidden
meaning
of
the
novel
is
a
cry
to
the
coming
men
to
unite
their
strength
against
the
foe
without
and
the
foe
within
the
gates
it
is
an
appeal
to
them
not
only
to
hasten
the
death
of
the
old
regime
of
Nicolas
I
but
an
appeal
to
them
to
conquer
their
sluggishness
their
weakness
and
their
apathy
It
is
a
cry
for
Men
Turgenev
sought
in
vain
in
life
for
a
type
of
man
to
satisfy
Russia
and
ended
by
taking
no
living
model
for
his
hero
but
the
hearsay
Insarov
a
foreigner
Russia
has
not
yet
produced
men
of
this
type
But
the
artist
does
not
despair
of
the
future
Here
we
come
upon
one
of
the
most
striking
figures
of
Turgenev
that
of
Uvar
Ivanovitch
He
symbolises
the
ever-predominant
type
of
Russian
the
sleepy
slothful
Slav
of
to-day
yesterday
and
to-morrow
He
is
the
Slav
whose
inherent
force
Europe
is
as
ignorant
of
as
he
is
himself
Though
he
speaks
only
twenty
sentences
in
the
book
he
is
a
creation
of
Tolstoian
force
His
very
words
are
dark
and
of
practically
no
significance
There
lies
the
irony
of
the
portrait
The
last
words
of
the
novel
the
most
biting
surely
that
Turgenev
ever
wrote
contain
the
whole
essence
of
On
the
Eve
On
the
Eve
of
What
one
asks
Time
has
given
contradictory
answers
to
the
men
of
all
parties
The
Elenas
of
to-day
need
not
turn
their
eyes
abroad
to
find
their
counterpart
in
spirit
so
far
at
least
the
pessimists
are
refuted
but
the
note
of
death
that
Turgenev
strikes
in
his
marvellous
chapter
on
Venice
has
still
for
young
Russia
an
ominous
echo
so
many
generations
have
arisen
eager
only
to
be
flung
aside
helpless
that
one
asks
what
of
the
generation
that
fronts
Autocracy
to-day
Do
you
remember
I
asked
you
Will
there
ever
be
men
among
us
and
you
answered
there
will
be
O
primaeval
force
And
now
from
here
in
my
poetic
distance
I
will
ask
you
again
What
do
you
say
Uvar
Ivanovitch
will
there
be
Uvar
Ivanovitch
flourished
his
fingers
and
fixed
his
enigmatical
stare
into
the
far
distance
This
creation
of
an
universal
national
type
out
of
the
flesh
and
blood
of
a
fat
taciturn
country
gentleman
brings
us
to
see
that
Turgenev
was
not
merely
an
artist
but
that
he
was
a
poet
using
fiction
as
his
medium
To
this
end
it
is
instructive
to
compare
Jane
Austen
perhaps
the
greatest
English
exponent
of
the
domestic
novel
with
the
Russian
master
and
to
note
that
while
as
a
novelist
she
emerges
favourably
from
the
comparison
she
is
absolutely
wanting
in
his
poetic
insight
How
petty
and
parochial
appears
her
outlook
in
Emma
compared
to
the
wide
and
unflinching
gaze
of
Turgenev
She
painted
most
admirably
the
English
types
she
knew
and
how
well
she
knew
them
but
she
failed
to
correlate
them
with
the
national
life
and
yet
while
her
men
and
women
were
acting
and
thinking
Trafalgar
and
Waterloo
were
being
fought
and
won
But
each
of
Turgenev
s
novels
in
some
subtle
way
suggests
that
the
people
he
introduces
are
playing
their
little
part
in
a
great
national
drama
everywhere
around
us
invisible
yet
audible
through
the
clamour
of
voices
near
us
And
so
On
the
Eve
the
work
of
a
poet
has
certain
deep
notes
which
break
through
the
harmonious
tenor
of
the
whole
and
strangely
and
swiftly
transfigure
the
quiet
story
troubling
us
with
a
dawning
consciousness
of
the
march
of
mighty
events
Suddenly
a
strange
sense
steals
upon
the
reader
that
he
is
living
in
a
perilous
atmosphere
filling
his
heart
with
foreboding
and
enveloping
at
length
the
characters
themselves
all
unconsciously
awaiting
disaster
in
the
sunny
woods
and
gardens
of
Kuntsovo
But
not
till
the
last
chapters
are
reached
does
the
English
reader
perceive
that
in
recreating
for
him
the
mental
atmosphere
of
a
single
educated
Russian
household
Turgenev
has
been
casting
before
his
eyes
the
faint
shadow
of
the
national
drama
which
was
indeed
played
though
left
unfinished
on
the
Balkan
battlefields
of
1876-7
Briefly
Turgenev
in
sketching
the
dawn
of
love
in
a
young
girl
s
soul
has
managed
faintly
but
unmistakably
to
make
spring
and
flourish
in
our
minds
the
ineradicable
though
hidden
idea
at
the
back
of
Slav
thought
the
unification
of
the
Slav
races
How
doubly
welcome
that
art
should
be
which
can
lead
us
the
foreigners
thus
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
national
secrets
of
a
great
people
secrets
which
our
own
critics
and
diplomatists
must
necessarily
misrepresent
Each
of
Turgenev
s
novels
may
be
said
to
contain
a
light-bringing
rejoinder
to
the
old-fashioned
criticism
of
the
Muscovite
current
up
to
the
rise
of
the
Russian
novel
and
still
unfortunately
lingering
among
us
but
On
the
Eve
of
all
the
novels
contains
perhaps
the
most
instructive
political
lesson
England
can
learn
Europe
has
always
had
and
most
assuredly
England
has
been
over-rich
in
those
alarm-monger
critics
watchdogs
for
ever
baying
at
Slav
cupidity
treachery
intrigue
and
so
on
and
so
on
It
is
useful
to
have
these
well-meaning
animals
on
the
political
premises
giving
noisy
tongue
whenever
the
Slav
stretches
out
his
long
arm
and
opens
his
drowsy
eyes
but
how
rare
it
is
to
find
a
man
who
can
teach
us
to
interpret
a
nation
s
aspirations
to
gauge
its
inner
force
its
aim
its
inevitability
Turgenev
gives
us
such
clues
In
the
respectful
if
slightly
forced
silence
that
has
been
imposed
by
certain
recent
political
events
on
the
tribe
of
faithful
watchdogs
it
may
be
permitted
to
one
to
say
that
whatever
England
s
interest
may
be
in
relation
to
Russia
s
development
it
is
better
for
us
to
understand
the
force
of
Russian
aims
before
we
measure
our
strength
against
it
And
a
novel
such
as
On
the
Eve
though
now
nearly
forty
years
old
and
to
the
short-sighted
out
of
date
reveals
in
a
flash
the
attitude
of
the
Slav
towards
his
political
destiny
His
aspirations
may
have
to
slumber
through
policy
or
necessity
they
may
be
distorted
or
misrepresented
or
led
astray
by
official
action
but
we
confess
that
for
us
On
the
Eve
suggests
the
existence
of
a
mighty
lake
whose
waters
dammed
back
for
a
while
are
rising
slowly
but
are
still
some
way
from
the
brim
How
long
will
it
take
to
the
overflow
Nobody
knows
but
when
the
long
winter
of
Russia
s
dark
internal
policy
shall
be
broken
up
will
the
snows
melting
on
the
mountains
stream
south-west
inundating
the
Valley
of
the
Danube
Or
as
the
national
poet
Pushkin
has
sung
will
there
be
a
pouring
of
many
Slavonian
rivulets
into
the
Russian
sea
a
powerful
attraction
of
the
Slav
races
towards
a
common
centre
to
create
an
era
of
peace
and
development
within
whereby
Russia
may
rise
free
and
rejoicing
to
face
her
great
destinies
Hard
and
bitter
is
the
shaping
of
nations
Uvar
Ivanovitch
still
fixes
his
enigmatical
stare
into
the
far
distance

of
a
in
father
e
a
in
pane
i
ee
u

y
is
always
consonantal
except
when
it
is
the
last
letter
of
the
word
g
is
always
hard
On
one
of
the
hottest
days
of
the
summer
of
1853
in
the
shade
of
a
tall
lime-tree
on
the
bank
of
the
river
Moskva
not
far
from
Kuntsovo
two
young
men
were
lying
on
the
grass
One
who
looked
about
twenty-three
tall
and
swarthy
with
a
sharp
and
rather
crooked
nose
a
high
forehead
and
a
restrained
smile
on
his
wide
mouth
was
lying
on
his
back
and
gazing
meditatively
into
the
distance
his
small
grey
eyes
half
closed
The
other
was
lying
on
his
chest
his
curly
fair
head
propped
on
his
two
hands
he
too
was
looking
away
into
the
distance
He
was
three
years
older
than
his
companion
but
seemed
much
younger
His
moustache
was
only
just
growing
and
his
chin
was
covered
with
a
light
curly
down
There
was
something
childishly
pretty
something
attractively
delicate
in
the
small
features
of
his
fresh
round
face
in
his
soft
brown
eyes
lovely
pouting
lips
and
little
white
hands
Everything
about
him
was
suggestive
of
the
happy
light-heartedness
of
perfect
health
and
youth
the
carelessness
conceit
self-indulgence
and
charm
of
youth
He
used
his
eyes
and
smiled
and
leaned
his
head
as
boys
do
who
know
that
people
look
at
them
admiringly
He
wore
a
loose
white
coat
made
like
a
blouse
a
blue
kerchief
wrapped
his
slender
throat
and
a
battered
straw
hat
had
been
flung
on
the
grass
beside
him
His
companion
seemed
elderly
in
comparison
with
him
and
no
one
would
have
supposed
from
his
angular
figure
that
he
too
was
happy
and
enjoying
himself
He
lay
in
an
awkward
attitude
his
large
head
wide
at
the
crown
and
narrower
at
the
base
hung
awkwardly
on
his
long
neck
awkwardness
was
expressed
in
the
very
pose
of
his
hands
of
his
body
tightly
clothed
in
a
short
black
coat
and
of
his
long
legs
with
their
knees
raised
like
the
hind-legs
of
a
grasshopper
For
all
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
recognise
that
he
was
a
man
of
good
education
the
whole
of
his
clumsy
person
bore
the
stamp
of
good-breeding
and
his
face
plain
and
even
a
little
ridiculous
as
it
was
showed
a
kindly
nature
and
a
thoughtful
habit
His
name
was
Andrei
Petrovitch
Bersenyev
his
companion
the
fair-haired
young
man
was
called
Pavel
Yakovlitch
Shubin
Why
don
t
you
lie
on
your
face
like
me
began
Shubin
It
s
ever
so
much
nicer
so
especially
when
you
kick
up
your
heels
and
clap
them
together
like
this
You
have
the
grass
under
your
nose
when
you
re
sick
of
staring
at
the
landscape
you
can
watch
a
fat
beetle
crawling
on
a
blade
of
grass
or
an
ant
fussing
about
It
s
really
much
nicer
But
you
ve
taken
up
a
pseudo-classical
pose
for
all
the
world
like
a
ballet-dancer
when
she
reclines
upon
a
rock
of
paste-board
You
should
remember
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
take
a
rest
now
It
s
no
joking
matter
to
come
out
third
Take
your
ease
sir
give
up
all
exertion
and
rest
your
weary
limbs
Shubin
delivered
this
speech
through
his
nose
in
a
half-lazy
half-joking
voice
spoilt
children
speak
so
to
friends
of
the
house
who
bring
them
sweetmeats
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
went
on
What
strikes
me
most
forcibly
in
the
ants
and
beetles
and
other
worthy
insects
is
their
astounding
seriousness
They
run
to
and
fro
with
such
a
solemn
air
as
though
their
life
were
something
of
such
importance
A
man
the
lord
of
creation
the
highest
being
stares
at
them
if
you
please
and
they
pay
no
attention
to
him
Why
a
gnat
will
even
settle
on
the
lord
of
creation
s
nose
and
make
use
of
him
for
food
It
s
most
offensive
And
on
the
other
hand
how
is
their
life
inferior
to
ours
And
why
shouldn
t
they
take
themselves
seriously
if
we
are
to
be
allowed
to
take
ourselves
seriously
There
now
philosopher
solve
that
problem
for
me
Why
don
t
you
speak
Eh
What
said
Bersenyev
starting
What
repeated
Shubin
Your
friend
lays
his
deepest
thoughts
before
you
and
you
don
t
listen
to
him
I
was
admiring
the
view
Look
how
hot
and
bright
those
fields
are
in
the
sun
Bersenyev
spoke
with
a
slight
lisp
There
s
some
fine
colour
laid
on
there
observed
Shubin
Nature
s
a
good
hand
at
it
that
s
the
fact
Bersenyev
shook
his
head
You
ought
to
be
even
more
ecstatic
over
it
than
I
It
s
in
your
line
you
re
an
artist
No
it
s
not
in
my
line
rejoined
Shubin
putting
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
Flesh
is
my
line
my
work
s
with
flesh
modelling
flesh
shoulders
legs
and
arms
and
here
there
s
no
form
no
finish
it
s
all
over
the
place
Catch
it
if
you
can
But
there
is
beauty
here
too
remarked
Bersenyev
By
the
way
have
you
finished
your
bas-relief
Which
one
The
boy
with
the
goat
Hang
it
Hang
it
Hang
it
cried
Shubin
drawling
I
looked
at
the
genuine
old
things
the
antiques
and
I
smashed
my
rubbish
to
pieces
You
point
to
nature
and
say
there
s
beauty
here
too
Of
course
there
s
beauty
in
everything
even
in
your
nose
there
s
beauty
but
you
can
t
try
after
all
kinds
of
beauty
The
ancients
they
didn
t
try
after
it
beauty
came
down
of
itself
upon
their
creations
from
somewhere
or
other
from
heaven
I
suppose
The
whole
world
belonged
to
them
it
s
not
for
us
to
be
so
large
in
our
reach
our
arms
are
short
We
drop
our
hook
into
one
little
pool
and
keep
watch
over
it
If
we
get
a
bite
so
much
the
better
if
not
Shubin
put
out
his
tongue
Stop
stop
said
Bensenyev
that
s
a
paradox
If
you
have
no
sympathy
for
beauty
if
you
do
not
love
beauty
wherever
you
meet
it
it
will
not
come
to
you
even
in
your
art
If
a
beautiful
view
if
beautiful
music
does
not
touch
your
heart
I
mean
if
you
are
not
sympathetic
Ah
you
are
a
confirmed
sympathetic
broke
in
Shubin
laughing
at
the
new
title
he
had
coined
while
Bersenyev
sank
into
thought
No
my
dear
fellow
Shubin
went
on
you
re
a
clever
person
a
philosopher
third
graduate
of
the
Moscow
University
it
s
dreadful
arguing
with
you
especially
for
an
ignoramus
like
me
but
I
tell
you
what
besides
my
art
the
only
beauty
I
love
is
in
women
in
girls
and
even
that
s
recently
He
turned
over
on
to
his
back
and
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
A
few
instants
passed
by
in
silence
The
hush
of
the
noonday
heat
lay
upon
the
drowsy
blazing
fields
Speaking
of
women
Shubin
began
again
how
is
it
no
one
looks
after
Stahov
Did
you
see
him
in
Moscow
No
The
old
fellow
s
gone
clean
off
his
head
He
sits
for
whole
days
together
at
his
Augustina
Christianovna
s
he
s
bored
to
death
but
still
he
sits
there
They
gaze
at
one
another
so
stupidly
It
s
positively
disgusting
to
see
them
Man
s
a
strange
animal
A
man
with
such
a
home
but
no
he
must
have
his
Augustina
Christianovna
I
don
t
know
anything
more
repulsive
than
her
face
just
like
a
duck
s
The
other
day
I
modelled
a
caricature
of
her
in
the
style
of
Dantan
It
wasn
t
half
bad
I
will
show
it
you
And
Elena
Nikolaevna
s
bust
inquired
Bersenyev
is
it
getting
on
No
my
dear
boy
it
s
not
getting
on
That
face
is
enough
to
drive
one
to
despair
The
lines
are
pure
severe
correct
one
would
think
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
catching
a
likeness
It
s
not
as
easy
as
one
would
think
though
It
s
like
a
treasure
in
a
fairy-tale
you
can
t
get
hold
of
it
Have
you
ever
noticed
how
she
listens
There
s
not
a
single
feature
different
but
the
whole
expression
of
the
eyes
is
constantly
changing
and
with
that
the
whole
face
changes
What
is
a
sculptor
and
a
poor
one
too
to
do
with
such
a
face
She
s
a
wonderful
creature
a
strange
creature
he
added
after
a
brief
pause
Yes
she
is
a
wonderful
girl
Bersenyev
repeated
after
him
And
she
the
daughter
of
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
Stahov
And
after
that
people
talk
about
blood
about
stock
The
amusing
part
of
it
is
that
she
really
is
his
daughter
like
him
as
well
as
like
her
mother
Anna
Vassilyevna
I
respect
Anna
Vassilyevna
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
she
s
been
awfully
good
to
me
but
she
s
no
better
than
a
hen
Where
did
Elena
get
that
soul
of
hers
Who
kindled
that
fire
in
her
There
s
another
problem
for
you
philosopher
But
as
before
the
philosopher
made
no
reply
Bersenyev
did
not
in
general
err
on
the
side
of
talkativeness
and
when
he
did
speak
he
expressed
himself
awkwardly
with
hesitation
and
unnecessary
gesticulation
And
at
this
time
a
kind
of
special
stillness
had
fallen
on
his
soul
a
stillness
akin
to
lassitude
and
melancholy
He
had
not
long
come
from
town
after
prolonged
hard
work
which
had
absorbed
him
for
many
hours
every
day
The
inactivity
the
softness
and
purity
of
the
air
the
consciousness
of
having
attained
his
object
the
whimsical
and
careless
talk
of
his
friend
and
the
image
so
suddenly
called
up
of
one
dear
to
him
all
these
impressions
different
yet
at
the
same
time
in
a
way
akin
were
mingled
in
him
into
a
single
vague
emotion
which
at
once
soothed
and
excited
him
and
robbed
him
of
his
power
He
was
a
very
highly
strung
young
man
It
was
cool
and
peaceful
under
the
lime-tree
the
flies
and
bees
seemed
to
hum
more
softly
as
they
flitted
within
its
circle
of
shade
The
fresh
fine
grass
of
purest
emerald
green
without
a
tinge
of
gold
did
not
quiver
the
tall
flower
stalks
stood
motionless
as
though
enchanted
On
the
lower
twigs
of
the
lime-tree
the
little
bunches
of
yellow
flowers
hung
still
as
death
At
every
breath
a
sweet
fragrance
made
its
way
to
the
very
depths
of
the
lungs
and
eagerly
the
lungs
inhaled
it
Beyond
the
river
in
the
distance
right
up
to
the
horizon
all
was
bright
and
glowing
At
times
a
slight
breeze
passed
over
breaking
up
the
landscape
and
intensifying
the
brightness
a
sunlit
vapour
hung
over
the
fields
No
sound
came
from
the
birds
they
do
not
sing
in
the
heat
of
noonday
but
the
grasshoppers
were
chirping
everywhere
and
it
was
pleasant
as
they
sat
in
the
cool
and
quietness
to
hear
that
hot
eager
sound
of
life
it
disposed
to
slumber
and
inclined
the
heart
to
reveries
Have
you
noticed
began
Bersenyev
eking
out
his
words
with
gesticulations
what
a
strange
feeling
nature
produces
in
us
Everything
in
nature
is
so
complete
so
defined
I
mean
to
say
so
content
with
itself
and
we
understand
that
and
admire
it
and
at
the
same
time
in
me
at
least
it
always
excites
a
kind
of
restlessness
a
kind
of
uneasiness
even
melancholy
What
is
the
meaning
of
it
Is
it
that
in
the
face
of
nature
we
are
more
vividly
conscious
of
all
our
incompleteness
our
indefiniteness
or
have
we
little
of
that
content
with
which
nature
is
satisfied
but
something
else
I
mean
to
say
what
we
need
nature
has
not
H
m
replied
Shubin
I
ll
tell
you
Andrei
Petrovitch
what
all
that
comes
from
You
describe
the
sensations
of
a
solitary
man
who
is
not
living
but
only
looking
on
in
ecstasy
Why
look
on
Live
yourself
and
you
will
be
all
right
However
much
you
knock
at
nature
s
door
she
will
never
answer
you
in
comprehensible
words
because
she
is
dumb
She
will
utter
a
musical
sound
or
a
moan
like
a
harp
string
but
don
t
expect
a
song
from
her
A
living
heart
now
that
will
give
you
your
answer
especially
a
woman
s
heart
So
my
dear
fellow
I
advise
you
to
get
yourself
some
one
to
share
your
heart
and
all
your
distressing
sensations
will
vanish
at
once
That
s
what
we
need
as
you
say
This
agitation
and
melancholy
all
that
you
know
is
simply
a
hunger
of
a
kind
Give
the
stomach
some
real
food
and
everything
will
be
right
directly
Take
your
place
in
the
landscape
live
in
the
body
my
dear
boy
And
after
all
what
is
nature
what
s
the
use
of
it
Only
hear
the
word
love
what
an
intense
glowing
sound
it
has
Nature
what
a
cold
pedantic
expression
And
so
Shubin
began
humming
my
greetings
to
Marya
Petrovna
or
rather
he
added
not
Marya
Petrovna
but
it
s
all
the
same
Voo
me
compreny
Bersenyev
got
up
and
stood
with
his
chin
leaning
on
his
clasped
hands
What
is
there
to
laugh
at
he
said
without
looking
at
his
companion
why
should
you
scoff
Yes
you
are
right
love
is
a
grand
word
a
grand
feeling
But
what
sort
of
love
do
you
mean
Shubin
too
got
up
What
sort
What
you
like
so
long
as
it
s
there
I
will
confess
to
you
that
I
don
t
believe
in
the
existence
of
different
kinds
of
love
If
you
are
in
love
With
your
whole
heart
put
in
Bersenyev
Well
of
course
that
s
an
understood
thing
the
heart
s
not
an
apple
you
can
t
divide
it
If
you
re
in
love
you
re
justified
And
I
wasn
t
thinking
of
scoffing
My
heart
s
as
soft
at
this
moment
as
if
it
had
been
melted
I
only
wanted
to
explain
why
nature
has
the
effect
on
us
you
spoke
of
It
s
because
she
arouses
in
us
a
need
for
love
and
is
not
capable
of
satisfying
