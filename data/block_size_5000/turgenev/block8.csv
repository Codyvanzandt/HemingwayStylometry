post
of
superintendent
of
government
warehouses
a
profitable
and
even
honourable
position
which
did
not
call
for
conspicuous
abilities
the
warehouses
themselves
had
only
a
hypothetical
existence
and
indeed
it
was
not
very
precisely
known
with
what
they
were
to
be
filled
but
they
had
been
invented
with
a
view
to
government
economy
Anton
Stepanitch
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
What
my
dear
sir
he
began
do
you
seriously
maintain
that
something
supernatural
has
happened
to
you
I
mean
to
say
something
inconsistent
with
the
laws
of
nature
I
do
maintain
it
replied
the
gentleman
addressed
as
My
dear
sir
whose
name
was
Porfiry
Kapitonitch
Inconsistent
with
the
laws
of
nature
Anton
Stepanitch
repeated
angrily
apparently
he
liked
the
phrase
Just
so
yes
it
was
precisely
what
you
say
That
's
amazing
What
do
you
think
of
it
gentlemen
Anton
Stepanitch
tried
to
give
his
features
an
ironical
expression
but
without
effect
or
to
speak
more
accurately
merely
with
the
effect
of
suggesting
that
the
dignified
civil
councillor
had
detected
an
unpleasant
smell
Might
we
trouble
you
dear
sir
he
went
on
addressing
the
Kaluga
landowner
to
give
us
the
details
of
so
interesting
an
incident
Certainly
why
not
answered
the
landowner
and
moving
in
a
free-and-easy
way
to
the
middle
of
the
room
he
spoke
as
follows
I
have
gentlemen
as
you
are
probably
aware
or
perhaps
are
not
aware
a
small
estate
in
the
Kozelsky
district
In
old
days
I
used
to
get
something
out
of
it
though
now
of
course
I
have
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
unpleasantness
But
enough
of
politics
Well
in
that
district
I
have
a
little
place
the
usual
kitchen
garden
a
little
pond
with
carp
in
it
farm
buildings
of
a
sort
and
a
little
lodge
for
my
own
sinful
person
I
am
a
bachelor
Well
one
day
some
six
years
ago
I
came
home
rather
late
I
had
had
a
game
of
cards
at
a
neighbour
's
and
I
was
I
beg
you
to
note
the
least
little
bit
elevated
as
they
say
I
undressed
got
into
bed
and
put
out
the
candle
And
only
fancy
gentlemen
as
soon
as
I
put
out
the
candle
there
was
something
moving
under
my
bed
I
wondered
whether
it
was
a
rat
no
it
was
not
a
rat
it
moved
about
scratched
on
the
floor
and
scratched
itself
At
last
it
flapped
its
ears
There
was
no
mistake
about
it
it
was
a
dog
But
where
could
a
dog
have
come
from
I
did
not
keep
one
could
some
stray
dog
have
run
in
I
wondered
I
called
my
servant
Filka
was
his
name
He
came
in
with
a
candle
'How
's
this
I
said
'Filka
my
lad
Is
that
how
you
look
after
things
A
dog
has
got
under
my
bed
'What
dog
said
he
'How
do
I
know
said
I
'that
's
your
business
to
save
your
master
from
disturbance
My
Filka
bent
down
and
began
moving
the
candle
under
the
bed
'But
there
's
no
dog
here
said
he
I
bent
down
too
there
certainly
was
no
dog
there
What
a
queer
thing
I
glanced
at
Filka
and
he
was
smiling
'You
stupid
I
said
to
him
'why
are
you
grinning
When
you
opened
the
door
the
dog
must
have
whisked
out
into
the
passage
And
you
gaping
idiot
saw
nothing
because
you
are
always
asleep
You
do
n't
suppose
I
am
drunk
do
you
He
would
have
answered
but
I
sent
him
out
curled
up
and
that
night
heard
nothing
more
But
the
next
night
only
fancy
the
thing
was
repeated
As
soon
as
I
blew
out
the
candle
he
scratched
himself
and
flapped
his
ears
again
Again
I
called
Filka
again
he
looked
under
the
bed
again
there
was
nothing
I
sent
him
away
blew
out
the
candle
and
damn
it
all
the
dog
was
there
again
and
it
was
a
dog
right
enough
one
could
hear
it
breathing
biting
its
coat
looking
for
fleas
It
was
so
distinct
'Filka
I
said
'come
here
without
the
candle
He
came
in
'Well
now
I
said
'do
you
hear
'Yes
he
said
I
could
not
see
him
but
I
felt
that
the
fellow
was
scared
'What
do
you
make
of
it
said
I
'What
do
you
bid
me
make
of
it
Porfiry
Kapitonitch
It's
sorcery
'You
are
a
foolish
fellow
I
said
'hold
your
tongue
with
your
sorcery
And
our
voices
quavered
like
a
bird
's
and
we
were
trembling
in
the
dark
as
though
we
were
in
a
fever
I
lighted
a
candle
no
dog
no
sound
only
us
two
as
white
as
chalk
So
I
kept
a
candle
burning
till
morning
and
I
assure
you
gentlemen
you
may
believe
me
or
you
may
not
but
from
that
night
for
six
weeks
the
same
thing
was
repeated
In
the
end
I
actually
got
used
to
it
and
began
putting
out
the
candle
because
I
could
n't
get
to
sleep
in
the
light
'Let
him
fidget
I
thought
'he
does
n't
do
me
any
harm
Well
I
see
you
are
not
one
of
the
chicken-hearted
brigade
Anton
Stepanitch
interrupted
in
a
half-contemptuous
half-condescending
tone
One
can
see
the
Hussar
at
once
I
should
n't
be
afraid
of
you
in
any
case
Porfiry
Kapitonitch
observed
and
for
an
instant
he
really
did
look
like
a
Hussar
But
listen
to
the
rest
A
neighbour
came
to
see
me
the
very
one
with
whom
I
used
to
play
cards
He
dined
with
me
on
what
luck
provided
and
dropped
some
fifty
roubles
for
his
visit
night
came
on
it
was
time
for
him
to
be
off
But
I
had
my
own
idea
'Stay
the
night
with
me
I
said
'Vassily
Vassilitch
tomorrow
please
God
you
will
win
it
back
Vassily
Vassilitch
considered
and
stayed
I
had
a
bed
put
up
for
him
in
my
room
Well
we
went
to
bed
smoked
chatted
about
the
fair
sex
for
the
most
part
as
is
only
suitable
in
bachelor
company
we
laughed
of
course
I
saw
Vassily
Vassilitch
put
out
his
candle
and
turn
his
back
towards
me
as
much
as
to
say
'Good
night
I
waited
a
little
then
I
too
put
out
my
candle
And
only
fancy
I
had
hardly
time
to
wonder
what
sort
of
trick
would
be
played
this
time
when
the
sweet
creature
was
moving
again
And
moving
was
not
all
it
came
out
from
under
the
bed
walked
across
the
room
tapped
on
the
floor
with
its
paws
shook
its
ears
and
all
of
a
sudden
pushed
against
the
very
chair
that
was
close
by
Vassily
Vassilitch
's
bed
'Porfiry
Kapitonitch
said
the
latter
and
in
such
an
unconcerned
voice
you
know
'I
did
not
know
you
had
a
dog
What
sort
is
it
a
setter
'I
have
n't
a
dog
I
said
'and
never
have
had
one
'You
have
n't
Why
what
's
this
'What
's
this
said
I
'why
light
the
candle
and
then
you
will
see
for
yourself
'Is
n't
it
a
dog
'No
Vassily
Vassilitch
turned
over
in
bed
'But
you
are
joking
dash
it
all
'No
I
am
not
joking
I
heard
him
go
strike
strike
with
a
match
while
the
creature
persisted
in
scratching
its
ribs
The
light
flared
up
and
hey
presto
not
a
trace
remained
Vassily
Vassilitch
looked
at
me
and
I
looked
at
him
'What
trick
is
this
he
said
'It
's
a
trick
I
said
'that
if
you
were
to
set
Socrates
himself
on
one
side
and
Frederick
the
Great
on
the
other
even
they
could
not
make
it
out
And
then
I
told
him
all
about
it
Did
n't
my
Vassily
Vassilitch
jump
out
of
bed
As
though
he
had
been
scalded
He
could
n't
get
into
his
boots
'Horses
he
cried
'horses
I
began
trying
to
persuade
him
but
it
was
no
use
He
positively
gasped
'I
wo
n't
stay
he
said
'not
a
minute
You
must
be
a
man
under
a
curse
Horses
However
I
prevailed
upon
him
Only
his
bed
was
dragged
into
another
room
and
nightlights
were
lighted
everywhere
At
our
tea
in
the
morning
he
had
regained
his
equanimity
he
began
to
give
me
advice
'You
should
try
being
away
from
home
for
a
few
days
Porfiry
Kapitonitch
he
said
'perhaps
this
abomination
would
leave
you
And
I
must
tell
you
my
neighbour
was
a
man
of
immense
intellect
He
managed
his
mother-in-law
wonderfully
he
fastened
an
I
O
U
upon
her
he
must
have
chosen
a
sentimental
moment
She
became
as
soft
as
silk
she
gave
him
an
authorisation
for
the
management
of
all
her
estate
what
more
would
you
have
You
know
it
is
something
to
get
the
better
of
one
's
mother-in-law
Eh
You
can
judge
for
yourselves
However
he
took
leave
of
me
in
some
displeasure
I
'd
stripped
him
of
a
hundred
roubles
again
He
actually
abused
me
'You
are
ungrateful
he
said
'you
have
no
feeling
but
how
was
I
to
blame
Well
be
that
as
it
may
I
considered
his
advice
That
very
day
I
drove
off
to
the
town
and
put
up
at
an
inn
kept
by
an
old
man
I
knew
a
Dissenter
He
was
a
worthy
old
fellow
though
a
little
morose
from
living
in
solitude
all
his
family
were
dead
But
he
disliked
tobacco
and
had
the
greatest
loathing
for
dogs
I
believe
he
would
have
been
torn
to
pieces
rather
than
consent
to
let
a
dog
into
his
room
'For
how
can
one
he
would
say
'the
Queen
of
Heaven
herself
is
graciously
pleased
to
be
on
my
wall
there
and
is
an
unclean
dog
to
put
his
infidel
nose
there
Of
course
it
was
lack
of
education
However
to
my
thinking
whatever
wisdom
a
man
has
he
had
better
stick
to
that
I
see
you
are
a
great
philosopher
Anton
Stepanitch
interrupted
a
second
time
with
the
same
sarcastic
smile
This
time
Porfiry
Kapitonitch
actually
frowned
How
much
I
know
of
philosophy
I
can
not
tell
he
observed
tugging
grimly
at
his
moustache
but
I
would
be
glad
to
give
you
a
lesson
in
it
We
all
simply
stared
at
Anton
Stepanitch
Every
one
of
us
expected
a
haughty
reply
or
at
least
a
glance
like
a
flash
of
lightning
But
the
civil
councillor
turned
his
contemptuous
smile
into
one
of
indifference
then
yawned
swung
his
foot
and
that
was
all
Well
I
stayed
at
that
old
fellow
's
Porfiry
Kapitonitch
went
on
He
gave
me
a
little
room
not
one
of
the
best
as
we
were
old
friends
his
own
was
close
by
the
other
side
of
the
partition
and
that
was
just
what
I
wanted
The
tortures
I
faced
that
night
A
little
room
a
regular
oven
stuffiness
flies
and
such
sticky
ones
in
the
corner
an
extraordinarily
big
shrine
with
ancient
ikons
with
dingy
setting
in
relief
on
them
It
fairly
reeked
of
oil
and
some
other
stuff
too
there
were
two
featherbeds
on
the
beds
If
you
moved
the
pillow
a
black
beetle
would
run
from
under
it
I
had
drunk
an
incredible
quantity
of
tea
feeling
so
dreary
it
was
simply
dreadful
I
got
into
bed
there
was
no
possibility
of
sleeping
and
the
other
side
of
the
partition
my
host
was
sighing
clearing
his
throat
repeating
his
prayers
However
he
subsided
at
last
I
heard
him
begin
to
snore
but
only
faintly
in
the
old-fashioned
polite
way
I
had
put
my
candle
out
long
ago
but
the
little
lamp
was
burning
before
the
ikons
That
prevented
it
I
suppose
So
I
got
up
softly
with
bare
feet
climbed
up
to
the
lamp
and
blew
it
out
Nothing
happened
'Oho
I
thought
'so
it
does
n't
come
off
in
other
people
's
houses
But
I
had
no
sooner
got
into
bed
than
there
was
a
commotion
again
He
was
scraping
on
the
floor
and
scratching
himself
and
shaking
his
ears
the
usual
thing
in
fact
Very
good
I
lay
still
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
I
heard
the
old
man
wake
up
'Sir
he
said
'hey
sir
'What
is
it
'Did
you
put
out
the
lamp
But
without
waiting
for
my
answer
he
burst
out
all
at
once
'What
's
that
What's
that
a
dog
A
dog
Ah
you
vile
heretic
'Wait
a
bit
old
man
before
you
scold
I
said
'You
had
better
come
here
yourself
Things
are
happening
I
said
'that
may
well
make
you
wonder
The
old
man
stirred
behind
the
partition
and
came
in
to
me
with
a
candle
a
very
very
thin
one
made
of
yellow
wax
I
was
surprised
when
I
looked
at
him
He
looked
bristling
all
over
with
hairy
ears
and
eyes
as
fierce
as
a
weasel
's
he
had
on
a
white
woollen
night
cap
a
beard
to
his
waist
white
too
and
a
waistcoat
with
copper
buttons
on
it
over
his
shirt
and
fur
boots
on
his
feet
and
he
smelt
of
juniper
In
this
attire
he
approached
the
ikons
crossed
himself
three
times
with
his
two
fingers
crossed
lighted
the
lamp
crossed
himself
again
and
turning
to
me
just
grunted
'Explain
And
thereupon
without
delay
I
told
him
all
that
had
happened
The
old
man
listened
to
my
account
and
did
not
drop
one
word
simply
shook
his
head
Then
he
sat
down
on
my
bed
and
still
said
nothing
He
scratched
his
chest
the
back
of
his
head
and
so
on
and
said
nothing
'Well
I
said
'Fedul
Ivanitch
what
do
you
think
Is
it
some
devil
's
sorcery
or
what
The
old
man
looked
at
me
'What
an
idea
Devil
's
sorcery
A
tobacco-smoker
like
you
might
well
have
that
at
home
but
not
here
Only
think
what
holiness
there
is
here
Sorcery
indeed
'And
if
it
is
not
sorcery
what
is
it
then
The
old
man
was
silent
again
again
he
scratched
himself
and
said
at
last
but
in
a
muffled
voice
for
his
moustache
was
all
over
his
mouth
'You
go
to
the
town
of
Belyov
There
is
no
one
who
can
help
you
but
one
man
And
that
man
lives
in
Belyov
He
is
one
of
our
people
If
he
is
willing
to
help
you
you
are
lucky
if
he
is
not
nothing
can
be
done
'And
how
am
I
to
find
this
man
I
said
'I
can
direct
you
about
that
he
answered
'but
how
can
it
be
sorcery
It
is
an
apparition
or
rather
an
indication
but
you
can
not
comprehend
it
it
is
beyond
your
understanding
Lie
down
to
sleep
now
with
the
blessing
of
our
Lord
Christ
I
will
burn
incense
and
in
the
morning
we
will
converse
Morning
you
know
brings
wisdom
Well
we
did
converse
in
the
morning
only
I
was
almost
stifled
by
that
incense
And
this
was
the
counsel
the
old
man
gave
me
that
when
I
reached
Belyov
I
should
go
into
the
market
place
and
ask
in
the
second
shop
on
the
right
for
one
Prohoritch
and
when
I
had
found
Prohoritch
put
into
his
hand
a
writing
and
the
writing
consisted
of
a
scrap
of
paper
on
which
stood
the
following
words
'In
the
name
of
the
Father
the
Son
and
the
Holy
Ghost
Amen
To
Sergey
Prohorovitch
Pervushin
Trust
this
man
Feduly
Ivanitch
And
below
'Send
the
cabbages
for
God
's
sake
I
thanked
the
old
man
and
without
further
discussion
ordered
my
carriage
and
drove
to
Belyov
For
I
reflected
that
though
I
suffered
no
harm
from
my
nocturnal
visitor
yet
it
was
uncanny
and
in
fact
not
quite
the
thing
for
a
nobleman
and
an
officer
what
do
you
think
And
did
you
really
go
to
Belyov
murmured
Finoplentov
Straight
to
Belyov
I
went
into
the
market
place
and
asked
at
the
second
shop
on
the
right
for
Prohoritch
'Is
there
such
a
person
I
asked
'Yes
they
told
me
'And
where
does
he
live
'By
the
Oka
beyond
the
market
gardens
'In
whose
house
'In
his
own
I
went
to
the
Oka
found
his
house
though
it
was
really
not
a
house
but
simply
a
hovel
I
saw
a
man
wearing
a
blue
patched
coat
and
a
ragged
cap
well
he
looked
like
a
working-man
he
was
standing
with
his
back
to
me
digging
among
his
cabbages
I
went
up
to
him
'Are
you
so
and
so
I
said
He
turned
round
and
I
tell
you
the
truth
I
have
never
seen
such
piercing
eyes
in
my
life
Yet
the
whole
face
was
shrunk
up
like
a
little
fist
with
a
little
wedge-shaped
beard
and
sunken
lips
He
was
an
old
man
'I
am
so
and
so
he
said
'What
are
you
needing
'Why
this
is
what
I
am
needing
I
said
and
put
the
writing
in
his
hand
He
looked
at
me
intently
and
said
'Come
indoors
I
ca
n't
read
without
spectacles
Well
I
went
with
him
into
his
hut
and
a
hut
it
certainly
was
poor
bare
crooked
only
just
holding
together
On
the
wall
there
was
an
ikon
of
old
workmanship
as
black
as
a
coal
only
the
whites
of
the
eyes
gleamed
in
the
faces
He
took
some
round
spectacles
in
iron
frames
out
of
a
little
table
put
them
on
his
nose
read
the
writing
and
looked
at
me
again
through
the
spectacles
'You
have
need
of
me
'I
certainly
have
I
answered
'Well
said
he
'if
you
have
tell
it
and
we
will
listen
And
only
fancy
he
sat
down
and
took
a
checked
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
and
spread
it
out
on
his
knee
and
the
handkerchief
was
full
of
holes
and
he
looked
at
me
with
as
much
dignity
as
though
he
were
a
senator
or
a
minister
and
he
did
not
ask
me
to
sit
down
And
what
was
still
stranger
I
felt
all
at
once
awe-stricken
so
awe-stricken
my
soul
sank
into
my
heels
He
pierced
me
through
with
his
eyes
and
that
's
the
fact
I
pulled
myself
together
however
and
told
him
all
my
story
He
was
silent
for
a
space
shrank
into
himself
chewed
his
lips
and
then
questioned
me
just
like
a
senator
again
majestically
without
haste
'What
is
your
name
he
asked
'Your
age
What
were
your
parents
Are
you
single
or
married
Then
again
he
munched
his
lips
frowned
held
up
his
finger
and
spoke
'Bow
down
to
the
holy
ikon
to
the
honourable
Saints
Zossima
and
Savvaty
of
Solovki
I
bowed
down
to
the
earth
and
did
not
get
up
in
a
hurry
I
felt
such
awe
for
the
man
and
such
submission
that
I
believe
that
whatever
he
had
told
me
to
do
I
should
have
done
it
on
the
spot
I
see
you
are
grinning
gentlemen
but
I
was
in
no
laughing
mood
then
I
assure
you
'Get
up
sir
said
he
at
last
'I
can
help
you
This
is
not
sent
you
as
a
chastisement
but
as
a
warning
it
is
for
your
protection
someone
is
praying
for
your
welfare
Go
to
the
market
now
and
buy
a
young
dog
and
keep
it
by
you
day
and
night
Your
visions
will
leave
you
and
moreover
that
dog
will
be
of
use
to
you
I
felt
as
though
light
dawned
upon
me
all
at
once
how
those
words
delighted
me
I
bowed
down
to
Prohoritch
and
would
have
gone
away
when
I
bethought
me
that
I
could
not
go
away
without
rewarding
him
I
got
a
three
rouble
note
out
of
my
pocket
But
he
thrust
my
hand
away
and
said
'Give
it
to
our
chapel
or
to
the
poor
the
service
I
have
done
you
is
not
to
be
paid
for
I
bowed
down
to
him
again
almost
to
the
ground
and
set
off
straight
for
the
market
And
only
fancy
as
soon
as
I
drew
near
the
shops
lo
and
behold
a
man
in
a
frieze
overcoat
comes
sauntering
towards
me
carrying
under
his
arm
a
two
months
old
setter
puppy
with
a
reddish
brown
coat
white
lips
and
white
forepaws
'Stay
I
said
to
the
man
in
the
overcoat
'what
will
you
sell
it
for
'For
two
roubles
Take
three
The
man
looked
at
me
in
amazement
thought
the
gentleman
had
gone
out
of
his
wits
but
I
flung
the
notes
in
his
face
took
the
pup
under
my
arm
and
made
for
my
carriage
The
coachman
quickly
had
the
horses
harnessed
and
that
evening
I
reached
home
The
puppy
sat
inside
my
coat
all
the
way
and
did
not
stir
and
I
kept
calling
him
'Little
Tr
sor
Little
Tr
sor
I
gave
him
food
and
drink
at
once
I
had
some
straw
brought
in
settled
him
and
whisked
into
bed
I
blew
out
the
candle
it
was
dark
'Well
now
begin
said
I
There
was
silence
'Begin
said
I
'you
so
and
so
Not
a
sound
as
though
to
mock
me
Well
I
began
to
feel
so
set
up
that
I
fell
to
calling
it
all
sorts
of
names
But
still
there
was
not
a
sound
I
could
only
hear
the
puppy
panting
Filka
I
cried
'Filka
Come
here
you
stupid
He
came
in
'Do
you
hear
the
dog
'No
sir
said
he
'I
hear
nothing
and
he
laughed
'And
you
wo
n't
hear
it
ever
again
said
I
'Here
's
half
a
rouble
for
vodka
'Let
me
kiss
your
hand
said
the
foolish
fellow
and
he
stooped
down
to
me
in
the
darkness
It
was
a
great
relief
I
must
tell
you
And
was
that
how
it
all
ended
asked
Anton
Stepanitch
this
time
without
irony
The
apparitions
ended
certainly
and
I
was
not
disturbed
in
any
way
but
wait
a
bit
the
whole
business
was
not
over
yet
My
Tr
sor
grew
he
turned
into
a
fine
fellow
He
was
heavy
with
flopping
ears
and
overhanging
lip
and
a
thick
tail
a
regular
sporting
dog
And
he
was
extremely
attached
to
me
too
The
shooting
in
our
district
is
poor
however
as
I
had
set
up
a
dog
I
got
a
gun
too
I
took
to
sauntering
round
the
neighbourhood
with
my
Tr
sor
sometimes
one
would
hit
a
hare
and
did
n't
he
go
after
that
hare
upon
my
soul
sometimes
a
quail
or
a
duck
But
the
great
thing
was
that
Tr
sor
was
never
a
step
away
from
me
Where
I
went
he
went
I
even
took
him
to
the
bath
with
me
I
did
really
One
lady
actually
tried
to
get
me
turned
out
of
her
drawing-room
on
account
of
Tr
sor
but
I
made
such
an
uproar
The
windows
I
broke
Well
one
day
it
was
in
summer
and
I
must
tell
you
there
was
a
drought
at
the
time
such
as
nobody
remembered
The
air
was
full
of
smoke
or
haze
There
was
a
smell
of
burning
the
sun
was
like
a
molten
bullet
and
as
for
the
dust
there
was
no
getting
it
out
of
one
's
nose
and
throat
People
walked
with
their
mouths
wide
open
like
crows
I
got
weary
of
sitting
at
home
in
complete
deshabille
with
shutters
closed
and
luckily
the
heat
was
beginning
to
abate
a
little
So
I
went
off
gentlemen
to
see
a
lady
a
neighbour
of
mine
She
lived
about
three-quarters
of
a
mile
away
and
she
certainly
was
a
benevolent
lady
She
was
still
young
and
blooming
and
of
most
prepossessing
appearance
but
she
was
of
rather
uncertain
temper
Though
that
is
no
harm
in
the
fair
sex
it
even
gives
me
pleasure
Well
I
reached
her
door
and
I
did
feel
that
I
had
had
a
hot
time
of
it
getting
there
Well
I
thought
Nimfodora
Semyonovna
will
regale
me
now
with
bilberry
water
and
other
cooling
drinks
and
I
had
already
taken
hold
of
the
doorhandle
when
all
at
once
there
was
the
tramping
of
feet
and
shrieking
and
shouting
of
boys
from
round
the
corner
of
a
hut
in
the
courtyard
I
looked
round
Good
heavens
A
huge
reddish
beast
was
rushing
straight
towards
me
at
the
first
glance
I
did
not
recognise
it
as
a
dog
its
jaws
were
open
its
eyes
were
bloodshot
its
coat
was
bristling
I
had
not
time
to
take
breath
before
the
monster
bounded
up
the
steps
stood
upon
its
hind
legs
and
made
straight
for
my
chest
it
was
a
position
I
was
numb
with
terror
and
could
not
lift
my
arms
I
was
completely
stupefied
I
could
see
nothing
but
the
terrible
white
tusks
just
before
my
nose
the
red
tongue
all
covered
with
white
foam
But
at
the
same
instant
another
dark
body
was
whisking
before
me
like
a
ball
it
was
my
darling
Tr
sor
defending
me
and
he
hung
like
a
leech
on
the
brute's
throat
The
creature
wheezed
grated
its
teeth
and
staggered
back
I
instantly
flung
open
the
door
and
got
into
the
hall
I
stood
hardly
knowing
what
I
was
doing
with
my
whole
weight
on
the
door
and
heard
a
desperate
battle
going
on
outside
I
began
shouting
and
calling
for
help
everyone
in
the
house
was
terribly
upset
Nimfodora
Semyonovna
ran
out
with
her
hair
down
the
voices
in
the
yard
grew
louder
and
all
at
once
I
heard
'Hold
the
gate
hold
it
fasten
it
I
opened
the
door
just
a
crack
and
looked
out
the
monster
was
no
longer
on
the
steps
the
servants
were
rushing
about
the
yard
in
confusion
waving
their
hands
and
picking
up
bits
of
wood
from
the
ground
they
were
quite
crazy
'To
the
village
it
has
run
off
to
the
village
shrieked
a
peasant
woman
in
a
cap
of
extraordinary
size
poking
her
head
out
of
a
dormer
window
I
went
out
of
the
house
'Where
is
my
Tr
sor
I
asked
and
at
once
I
saw
my
saviour
He
was
coming
from
the
gate
limping
covered
with
wounds
and
with
blood
'What
's
the
meaning
of
it
I
asked
the
servants
who
were
dashing
about
the
yard
as
though
possessed
'A
mad
dog
they
answered
'the
count
's
it
's
been
hanging
about
here
since
yesterday
We
had
a
neighbour
a
count
who
bred
very
fierce
foreign
dogs
My
knees
shook
I
rushed
to
a
looking-glass
and
looked
to
see
whether
I
had
been
bitten
No
thank
God
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
only
my
countenance
naturally
looked
green
while
Nimfodora
Semyonovna
was
lying
on
the
sofa
and
cackling
like
a
hen
Well
that
one
could
quite
understand
in
the
first
place
nerves
in
the
second
sensibility
She
came
to
herself
at
last
though
and
asked
me
whether
I
were
alive
I
answered
that
I
was
and
that
Tr
sor
had
saved
me
'Ah
she
said
'what
a
noble
creature
and
so
the
mad
dog
has
strangled
him
'No
I
said
'it
has
not
strangled
him
but
has
wounded
him
seriously
'Oh
she
said
'in
that
case
he
must
be
shot
this
minute
'Oh
no
I
said
'I
wo
n't
agree
to
that
I
shall
try
to
cure
him
At
that
moment
Tr
sor
began
scratching
at
the
door
I
was
about
to
go
and
open
it
for
him
'Oh
she
said
'what
are
you
doing
why
it
will
bite
us
all
'Upon
my
word
I
said
'the
poison
does
not
act
so
quickly
'Oh
how
can
you
she
said
'Why
you
have
taken
leave
of
your
senses
'Nimfotchka
I
said
'calm
yourself
be
reasonable
But
she
suddenly
cried
'Go
away
at
once
with
your
horrid
dog
'I
will
go
away
said
I
'At
once
she
said
'this
second
Get
along
with
you
she
said
'you
villain
and
never
dare
to
let
me
set
eyes
on
you
again
You
may
go
mad
yourself
'Very
good
said
I
'only
let
me
have
a
carriage
for
I
am
afraid
to
go
home
on
foot
now
'Give
him
the
carriage
the
coach
the
chaise
what
he
likes
only
let
him
be
gone
quickly
Oh
what
eyes
Oh
what
eyes
he
has
and
with
those
words
she
whisked
out
of
the
room
and
gave
a
maid
who
met
her
a
slap
in
the
face
and
I
heard
her
in
hysterics
again
And
you
may
not
believe
me
gentlemen
but
that
very
day
I
broke
off
all
acquaintance
with
Nimfodora
Semyonovna
on
mature
consideration
of
everything
I
am
bound
to
add
that
for
that
circumstance
too
I
shall
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
my
friend
Tr
sor
to
the
hour
of
my
death
Well
I
had
the
carriage
brought
round
put
my
Tr
sor
in
and
drove
home
When
I
got
home
I
looked
him
over
and
washed
his
wounds
and
thought
I
would
take
him
next
day
as
soon
as
it
was
light
to
the
wise
man
in
the
Yefremovsky
district
And
this
wise
man
was
an
old
peasant
a
wonderful
man
he
would
whisper
over
some
water
and
some
people
made
out
that
he
dropped
some
snake
spittle
into
it
would
give
it
as
a
draught
and
the
trouble
would
be
gone
completely
I
thought
by
the
way
I
would
be
bled
myself
at
Yefremovo
it
's
a
good
thing
as
a
precaution
against
fright
only
not
from
the
arm
of
course
but
from
the
falcon
What
place
is
that
the
falcon
Mr
Finoplentov
asked
with
demure
curiosity
Why
do
n't
you
know
It
is
here
on
the
fist
near
the
thumb
the
spot
on
which
one
shakes
the
snuff
from
one
's
horn
just
here
It
's
the
best
place
for
letting
blood
For
only
consider
the
blood
from
the
arm
comes
from
the
vein
but
here
it
is
of
no
consequence
The
doctors
do
n't
know
that
and
do
n't
understand
it
how
should
they
the
idle
drones
the
wretched
Germans
It
's
the
blacksmiths
who
go
in
for
it
And
are
n't
they
skilful
They
get
a
chisel
give
it
a
tap
with
a
hammer
and
it
