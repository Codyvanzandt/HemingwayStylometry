walked
very
carelessly
ancj
paid
Uttle
attention
to
the
rules
of
the
art
I
did
not
keep
a
constant
watch
on
my
dog
I
did
not
snort
over
a
thick
bush
in
the
hope
that
a
red-crested
blackcock
would
fly
up
from
it
with
a
clatter
and
outcry
and
I
kept
looking
at
my
watch
which
was
utterly
out
of
place
At
last
it
was
getting
on
for
nine
It
's
time
I
cried
aloud
and
was
just
turning
back
to
wards
the
house
when
a
huge
blackcock
really
was
startled
out
of
the
thick
grass
two
paces
from
me
I
fired
at
the
magnificent
bird
and
wounded
it
under
the
wing
It
almost
rolled
over
but
righted
itself
made
for
the
copse
quivering
its
wings
and
diving
tried
to
rise
above
the
first
aspen-trees
but
growing
weak
fell
all
of
a
heap
into
a
thicket
To
abandon
such
game
would
have
been
utterly
unpardon
able
I
promptly
went
after
it
entered
the
copse
made
a
signal
to
Dianka
and
a
few
mo
ments
later
heard
a
feeble
rustling
and
clat
tering
it
was
the
unhappy
blackcock
struggling
under
the
paws
of
my
quick-scented
dog
I
picked
it
up
put
it
in
my
gamebag
looked
round
and
stood
still
as
though
rivetted
to
the
spot
The
copse
into
which
I
had
gone
was
very
thick
and
overgrown
so
that
I
had
difficulty
in
getting
to
the
spot
where
the
bird
had
fallen
but
at
a
short
distance
from
me
there
was
a
winding
cart-road
and
along
that
road
my
beautiful
lady
was
riding
on
horseback
at
a
walking
pace
and
beside
her
the
man
who
had
overtaken
me
the
evening
before
I
recog
nised
him
by
his
moustaches
They
were
rid
ing
slowly
in
silence
holding
each
other's
hands
their
horses
seemed
scarcely
moving
languidly
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
grace
fully
craning
their
long
necks
Recovering
from
my
first
terror
yes
terror
I
can
give
no
other
name
to
the
feeling
which
sud
denly
overwhelmed
me
I
simply
fastened
my
eyes
on
her
How
lovely
she
was
How
en
chantingly
her
graceful
form
moved
to
meet
me
in
the
midst
of
the
emerald
greenery
Soft
shadows
delicate
reflections
slowly
glided
over
her
over
her
long
grey
dress
over
her
slen
der
slightly
bowed
neck
over
her
pale
rosy
face
over
her
glossy
black
hair
which
sprang
180
THREE
MEETINGS
out
in
luxuriant
abundance
from
under
her
low
hat
But
how
can
I
describe
the
expression
of
the
perfect
passionate
mutely
passionate
bliss
with
which
her
features
were
breathing
Her
head
seemed
as
though
bent
under
the
weight
of
it
moist
gleams
of
gold
shone
out
of
her
dark
eyes
half
hidden
by
their
lashes
they
looked
nowhere
those
happy
eyes
and
the
deli
cate
brows
were
lowered
over
them
A
vague
childlike
smile
the
smile
of
deep
joy
was
straying
on
her
lips
it
seemed
as
though
ex
cess
of
happiness
was
exhausting
and
as
it
were
breaking
her
down
a
little
just
as
the
fully
opened
flower
sometimes
breaks
down
its
stalk
both
her
hands
lay
limp
one
in
the
hand
of
the
man
riding
beside
her
the
other
on
the
horse
's
forelock
I
had
time
to
look
at
her
thoroughly
and
at
him
also
He
was
a
handsome
imposing-looking
man
with
a
for
eign
face
He
was
looking
at
her
boldly
and
gaily
and
as
far
as
I
could
judge
admiring
her
with
secret
pride
He
was
admiring
her
the
villain
and
was
very
well
pleased
with
him
self
and
not
sufficiently
moved
not
melted
with
gratitude
yes
that
was
what
was
lacking
i8i
And
indeed
no
man
deserves
such
devo
tion
What
soul
even
the
noblest
is
worthy
of
inspiring
such
happiness
in
another
soul
I
must
confess
I
envied
him
Mean
while
they
both
were
on
a
level
with
me
My
dog
suddenly
jumped
out
on
the
road
and
barked
My
unknown
lady
started
looked
hur
riedly
round
and
seeing
me
switched
her
horse
on
the
neck
with
the
riding
whip
The
horse
gave
a
snort
reared
and
set
off
at
a
gallop
The
man
at
once
spurred
his
raven
horse
and
when
a
few
minutes
later
I
came
out
of
the
copse
along
the
road
they
were
both
gal
loping
in
the
golden
distance
across
the
open
country
swaying
gracefully
and
rhythmically
in
their
saddles
and
were
galloping
not
in
the
direction
of
the
house
I
watched
them
They
soon
vanished
over
a
hill
brightly
lighted
by
the
sun
on
the
dark
line
of
the
horizon
I
stood
and
waited
with
slow
footsteps
went
back
into
the
wood
and
sat
down
on
a
little
path
covering
my
eyes
with
my
hands
I
have
noticed
when
one
meets
strangers
one
need
only
close
one
's
eyes
and
their
features
THREE
MEETINGS
at
once
rise
up
before
one
anyone
can
verify
the
truth
of
my
observations
in
the
street
The
more
famiHar
the
face
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
see
it
and
the
less
clear
is
its
expression
one
remembers
it
but
can
not
see
it
and
one
's
own
face
one
can
never
picture
each
separate
trait
however
slight
is
familiar
but
you
can
not
put
the
whole
image
together
And
so
I
sat
with
closed
eyes
and
at
once
saw
my
unknown
lady
and
her
companion
and
their
horses
and
everything
The
smiling
face
of
the
man
stood
out
before
me
with
peculiar
sharpness
and
distinctness
I
fell
to
looking
intently
at
it
it
grew
blurred
and
melted
away
into
a
crimson
mist
and
her
image
too
floated
away
after
it
and
sank
and
would
not
come
back
again
I
got
up
Well
I
thought
I
have
seen
them
anyway
have
seen
them
both
clearly
I
have
only
to
find
out
their
names
To
try
and
find
out
their
names
What
petty
in
appropriate
curiosity
but
I
swear
it
was
not
curiosity
that
was
roused
in
me
it
really
seemed
to
me
impossible
not
to
find
out
at
least
who
they
were
after
chance
had
so
strangel
and
so
persistently
thrown
me
in
their
way
I
had
however
no
longer
the
same
impatient
perplexity
as
before
it
was
replaced
by
a
con
fused
melancholy
feeling
of
which
I
was
a
lit
tle
ashamed
I
was
filled
with
envy
I
did
not
hurry
back
to
the
house
I
must
own
I
began
to
be
ashamed
of
probing
another
person
's
secret
Moreover
the
appearance
of
the
loving
couple
by
day
in
the
sunlight
though
unexpected
and
I
repeat
strange
had
not
ex
actly
calmed
but
as
it
were
cooled
me
off
I
saw
in
all
this
adventure
now
nothing
super
natural
marvellous
nothing
like
an
incred
ible
dream
I
began
shooting
again
with
more
attention
than
before
but
yet
I
had
no
real
enthusiasm
for
it
I
came
across
a
covey
and
it
kept
me
for
an
hour
and
a
half
The
young
snipe
for
a
long
time
did
not
call
in
response
to
my
whistle
probably
because
I
did
not
whistle
sufficiently
objectively
The
sun
had
risen
very
high
my
watch
said
twelve
o'clock
as
I
turned
my
steps
to
the
gar
den
of
the
old
house
I
walked
without
haste
When
at
last
I
caught
a
glimpse
from
the
hill
THREE
MEETINGS
of
the
little
low
house
my
heart
began
quivering
again
I
drew
near
and
not
without
secret
satisfaction
caught
sight
of
Lukyanitch
He
was
sitting
as
before
motion
less
on
the
bench
before
the
lodge
The
gates
were
shut
and
the
shutters
also
Good-day
old
man
I
shouted
from
some
distance
have
you
come
out
to
warm
your
self
Lukyanitch
turned
his
face
towards
me
and
lifted
his
cap
without
speaking
I
went
up
to
him
Good-day
old
man
good-day
I
repeated
wanting
to
soften
him
How
's
this
I
added
chancing
to
see
my
new
quarter
rouble
on
the
ground
did
n't
you
see
it
And
I
pointed
to
the
little
silver
disc
half
sticking
out
in
the
short
grass
Yes
I
saw
it
Then
how
is
it
you
did
n't
pick
it
up
Oh
it
's
not
my
money
so
I
did
n't
pick
it
up
What
a
man
you
are
I
protested
not
with
out
embarrassment
and
picking
up
the
quarter
rouble
I
held
it
out
to
him
again
Take
it
take
it
for
tea
Much
obliged
Lukyanitch
answered
me
with
a
calm
smile
There
's
no
need
we
do
well
as
it
is
much
obliged
But
I
am
ready
to
give
you
more
with
pleas
ure
I
repHed
in
confusion
What
for
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
your
honour
mach
obliged
for
your
kindness
but
we
shall
have
bread
and
the
best
of
it
Maybe
more
than
we
can
eat
at
this
time
of
day
And
he
got
up
and
held
out
his
hand
towards
he
little
gate
Stay
stay
old
man
I
said
almost
in
de
spair
How
unwilling
you
are
to
talk
to-day
really
Tell
me
at
any
rate
your
mistress
has
she
got
up
yet
Yes
And
is
she
at
home
No
her
honour
is
not
at
home
Has
she
driven
out
to
pay
visits
or
what
No
sir
she
has
gone
away
to
Moscow
To
Moscow
but
she
was
here
this
morn
ing
Yes
l86
THREE
MEETINGS
And
she
slept
the
night
here
Yes
And
she
had
only
come
a
little
while
ago
Yes
Then
how
is
it
my
man
Why
it
will
be
an
hour
ago
her
honour
was
pleased
to
set
off
for
Moscow
again
To
Moscow
I
stared
at
Lukyanitch
in
stupefaction
this
I
own
I
had
not
expected
And
Lukyanitch
looked
at
me
The
cunning
smile
of
old
age
twisted
his
dry
lips
and
faintly
gleamed
in
his
mournful
eyes
And
she
has
gone
with
her
sister
I
brought
out
at
last
Yes
So
that
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
now
No
The
old
man
is
deceiving
me
flashed
through
my
mind
that
cunning
smile
is
not
for
nothing
Listen
Lukyanitch
I
said
aloud
will
you
do
me
a
favour
What
is
your
pleasure
he
brought
out
tHE
TV/0
FRlENIDS
AND
OTHER
STORIES
slowly
evidently
beginning
to
be
worried
by
my
questions
You
say
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
can
you
show
it
to
me
That
is
you
want
to
look
at
the
rooms
Yes
at
the
rooms
Lukyanitch
was
silent
for
a
space
Certainly
he
brought
out
at
last
Please
come
And
bending
down
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
of
the
little
gate
I
followed
him
Crossing
the
little
yard
we
mounted
the
shaky
steps
The
old
man
pushed
open
the
door
there
was
no
lock
on
it
A
cord
with
a
loop
hung
through
the
key-hole
We
went
into
the
house
It
consisted
of
five
or
six
low
pitched
rooms
and
as
far
as
I
could
distinguish
in
the
faint
light
which
percolated
scantily
through
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
the
furni
ture
in
the
rooms
was
very
plain
and
decrepit
In
one
of
them
the
one
which
looked
out
into
the
garden
there
stood
a
little
old
piano
I
raised
the
bent
cover
and
struck
the
keys
a
sour
hissing
note
rang
out
and
peevishly
died
away
as
through
complaining
of
my
impudence
i88
THREE
MEETINGS
there
was
no
sign
from
which
one
could
have
guessed
that
people
had
just
lately
left
the
house
there
was
a
smell
in
it
of
something
deathly
and
stifling
not
as
though
it
were
lived
in
only
a
scrap
of
paper
lying
about
here
and
there
showed
by
its
whiteness
that
it
had
not
been
here
long
I
picked
up
one
such
scrap
of
paper
it
turned
out
to
be
a
bit
of
a
letter
on
one
side
in
a
bold
feminine
hand
were
traced
the
words
se
tdre
on
the
other
side
I
made
out
the
word
bonhenr
On
a
little
round
table
by
the
window
there
stood
a
nosegay
of
half-withered
flowers
and
a
crumpled
green
ribbon
lay
beside
it
I
took
that
little
rib
bon
for
a
souvenir
Lukyanitch
opened
a
nar
row
door
which
was
papered
like
the
wall
Here
he
said
stretching
out
his
hand
this
is
a
bedroom
and
there
beyond
it
is
the
maid
's
room
and
there
are
no
other
apart
ments
We
walked
back
along
the
passage
And
what
room
is
that
I
asked
pointing
to
a
broad
white
door
with
a
lock
That
Lukyanitch
answered
in
a
hollow
voice
that

of

I

just
such
a
house
for
myself
in
the
country
I
felt
ashamed
I
could
not
tnish
the
litde
speech
I
had
begun
Lukyanitdi
stood
with
his
grey
head
droop
ing
on
his
breast
and
kept
looking
at
me
some
what
strangely
from
under
his
brows
Show
it
me
I
said
Oh
very
well
he
answered
at
last
took
out
the
key
and
reluctantly
unlocked
the
door
I
glanced
into
the
storeroom
There
cer
tainly
was
nothing
remarkable
in
it
On
the
walls
there
were
old
portraits
with
gloomy
al
THREE
MEETINGS
most
black
faces
and
an
eyes
The
floor
was
littered
with
all
sorts
of
rubbish
Well
have
you
looked
at
it
Luk
anitch
asked
me
grimly
Yes
thank
you
I
answered
hurriedly
He
slammed
the
door
I
went
into
the
hall
and
from
the
hall
into
the
court
ard
Lukj-anitch
saw
me
out
muttered
I
wish
you
good-day
and
was
going
off
to
his
lodge
And
what
lady
was
it
staying
here
yester
day
I
called
after
him
I
met
her
to-day
in
the
copse
I
hoped
to
take
him
unawares
by
my
sudden
question
and
to
evoke
an
unconsidered
answer
But
the
old
man
only
gave
a
toneless
laugh
and
going
into
his
lodge
slammed
the
door
I
went
back
to
Glinnoye
I
felt
uncomfort
able
like
a
boy
who
has
been
put
to
shame
Xo
I
said
to
myself
It
seems
I
am
not
to
get
tD
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
Bother
it
I
wo
n't
think
any
more
about
it
An
hour
later
I
was
driving
home
thor
oughly
irritated
and
out
of
humour
A
week
passed
In
spite
of
my
efforts
to
drive
away
the
thought
of
my
unknown
lady
of
her
companion
of
my
meeting
with
them
it
was
continually
returning
and
haunting
me
with
the
tiresome
persistence
of
an
after-dinner
fly
Lukyanitch
with
his
mysterious
glances
and
reserved
speeches
with
his
cold
melancholy
smile
was
incessantly
recurring
to
my
mind
also
The
house
itself
when
I
re
called
it
the
very
house
itself
seemed
looking
slyly
and
stupidly
at
me
through
its
half-closed
shutters
and
as
it
were
taunted
me
and
seemed
to
be
saying
to
me
And
after
all
you
know
nothing
At
last
I
could
not
restrain
my
self
and
one
fine
day
drove
over
to
Glin
noye
and
from
Glinnoye
set
off
on
foot
Whither
The
reader
can
easily
guess
I
must
confess
that
as
I
approached
the
mys
terious
garden
I
was
aware
of
rather
strong
excitement
There
was
no
change
in
the
outer
appearance
of
the
house
the
same
closed
win
dows
the
same
forlorn
and
dejected
air
only
instead
of
Lukyanitch
a
young
servant-lad
of
twenty
in
a
full
long
nankeen
coat
and
a
red
shirt
was
sitting
on
the
bench
before
the
lodge
Good-day
my
lad
I
said
in
a
loud
voice
THREE
MEETINGS
He
jumped
up
at
once
and
opened
wide
his
startled
eyes
Good-day
my
lad
I
repeated
where
is
the
old
man
What
old
man
the
youth
brought
out
slowly
Lukyanitch
Ah
Lukyanitch
He
looked
away
Do
you
want
Lukyanitch
Yes
Lukyanitch
Is
he
at
home
N-no
the
lad
pronounced
hesitating
he
is
How
shall
I
tell
you
Is
he
unwell
or
what
No
Then
what
is
it
Why
he
is
n't
here
at
all
Not
here
No
Something
bad
has
happened
to
him
Is
he
dead
I
asked
with
amazement
He
strangled
himself
Strangled
himself
I
cried
with
horror
and
flung
up
my
hands
We
looked
into
each
other
's
faces
without
speaking
Was
it
long
ago
I
asked
at
last
Just
five
days
ago
He
was
buried
yester
day
But
why
did
he
strangle
himself
The
Lord
knows
He
was
a
free
man
he
had
a
salary
he
wanted
for
nothing
his
mis
tresses
looked
after
him
as
though
he
were
one
of
their
kin
They
are
good
to
us
you
know
God
bless
them
There
is
simply
no
making
out
what
came
over
him
The
Evil
One
must
have
confounded
him
But
how
did
he
do
it
Why
he
just
took
and
strangled
himself
Was
there
nothing
noticed
about
him
be
fore
What
can
I
say
Nothing
so
to
say
special
He
was
always
a
dreary
suspi
cious
man
He
would
be
sighing
and
groaning
I
feel
dreary
he
would
say
And
then
there
was
his
age
you
see
Of
late
he
certainly
had
begun
to
brood
a
bit
He
would
come
some
times
to
see
us
in
the
village
and
I
am
his
nephew
you
know
'Well
my
boy
he
would
say
'come
and
stay
the
night
with
me
will
you
'Why
uncle
'Oh
I
feel
a
bit
fright
THREE
MEETINGS
ened
somehow
and
dreary
by
myself
Well
and
I
would
come
to
him
He
would
come
out
into
the
yard
and
look
and
look
like
this
at
the
house
would
shake
his
head
and
heave
a
sigh
Before
the
very
night
in
which
he
put
an
end
to
his
life
he
came
to
us
and
asked
me
to
go
Well
I
came
So
when
we
reached
the
lodge
he
sat
a
little
on
the
bench
then
he
got
up
and
went
out
I
went
into
the
yard
and
cried
'Uncle
hey
uncle
Uncle
did
not
call
back
I
thought
'Where
can
he
have
gone
not
into
the
house
surely
And
I
went
into
the
house
It
was
beginning
to
get
dark
Well
as
I
passed
by
the
store
room
I
heard
something
scraping
behind
the
door
I
took
and
opened
the
door
and
there
he
was
sitting
squatting
under
the
window
'What
are
you
doing
here
uncle
said
I
How
he
turned
round
and
shouted
at
me
and
his
eyes
looked
about
so
quickly
they
were
burn
ing
like
a
cat
's
'What
do
you
vi^ant
Don't
you
see
I
am
shaving
And
his
voice
was
so
husky
My
hair
stood
on
end
to
hear
him
and
I
felt
frightened
I
do
n't
know
why
The
devils
must
have
been
round
him
by
that
time
'In
the
dark
I
said
and
my
knees
were
shak
ing
'Oh
said
he
that
is
all
right
Run
along
I
went
away
and
he
came
out
of
the
storeroom
and
locked
it
up
So
we
went
back
to
the
lodge
and
my
fright
passed
off
at
once
'What
were
you
doing
in
the
storeroom
un
cle
I
said
He
fairly
started
'Hold
your
tongue
and
he
got
on
his
bed
'Well
thought
I
'I
had
better
not
talk
to
him
it
seems
he
is
not
quite
the
thing
to-day
so
I
went
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
too
And
the
night
lamp
was
burning
in
the
corner
So
I
lay
down
and
dropped
asleep
you
know
All
at
once
I
heard
the
door
creak
softly
and
open
just
a
little
And
uncle
was
lying
with
his
back
to
the
door
and
as
you
remember
maybe
he
was
always
hard
of
hearing
But
he
jumped
up
at
once
'Who
is
calling
me
eh
who
He
has
come
for
me
for
me
And
he
went
out
into
the
yard
without
his
cap
I
won
dered
what
was
the
matter
with
him
and
then
like
a
sinner
I
fell
asleep
When
I
woke
up
next
morning
Lukyanitch
was
not
there
I
went
out
of
the
room
and
began
calling
him
he
was
nowhere
I
asked
the
watchman
THREE
MEETINGS
'Did
n't
ou
see
uncle
go
out
'No
he
said
'I
did
n't
'Well
brother
said
I
'he
's
gone
somehow
Oy
we
were
both
scared
'Let
us
go
Fedoseyitch
I
said
'let
us
go
and
see
whether
he
is
in
the
house
'Very
well
Vassily
Timofeyitch
he
said
and
he
looked
as
white
as
clay
We
went
into
the
house
When
we
passed
the
storeroom
I
looked
and
the
padlock
was
hanging
open
on
the
staple
I
pushed
at
the
door
and
it
was
bolted
in
side
Fedoseyitch
ran
round
to
look
in
at
the
window
'Vassily
Timofeyitch
he
cried
'there
are
legs
hanging
legs
ran
to
the
window
And
the
legs
were
his
Luk
yanitch
's
legs
He
had
hanged
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
room
Well
we
sent
for
the
police
They
took
him
down
the
cord
was
tied
with
twelve
knots
Well
what
did
the
Court
decide
What
did
they
decide
Why
nothing
They
thought
and
thought
what
could
be
the
reason
of
it
There
was
no
reason
for
it
So
they
concluded
that
it
must
be
supposed
that
he
was
out
of
his
mind
He
had
headaches
of
late
often
he
would
keep
complaining
of
his
head
I
talked
to
the
lad
for
another
half-hour
and
went
away
completely
bewildered
I
must
con
fess
that
I
could
not
look
at
that
decrepit
house
without
a
secret
superstitious
terror
A
month
later
I
went
away
from
the
country
and
by
degrees
all
these
horrors
and
mysterious
meetings
passed
out
of
my
mind
II
Three
years
had
passed
I
spent
the
greater
part
of
that
time
in
Petersburg
and
abroad
and
if
I
went
home
to
the
country
it
was
only
for
a
few
days
so
that
I
did
not
once
happen
to
be
in
Glinnoye
or
Mihailovskoye
Nor
did
I
see
my
beautiful
lady
nor
her
companion
One
day
towards
the
end
of
the
third
year
I
chanced
to
meet
at
an
evening
party
given
by
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
in
Moscow
Madame
Shly
kov
and
her
sister
Pelageya
Badayev
the
very
Pelageya
whom
I
had
like
a
sinner
supposed
till
then
to
be
a
fictitious
person
The
two
ladies
were
no
longer
young
but
THREE
MEETINGS
were
of
rather
agreeable
appearance
Their
conversation
was
distinguished
by
intelligence
and
liveliness
they
had
travelled
a
great
deal
and
had
profited
by
their
travels
a
spontane
ous
gaiety
was
conspicuous
in
their
behaviour
But
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
common
between
them
and
my
mysterious
lady
I
was
introduced
to
them
I
got
into
conversation
with
Madame
Shlykov
her
sister
's
attention
was
taken
up
by
a
distinguished
scientific
vis
itor
a
geologist
I
told
her
that
I
had
the
pleasure
of
being
her
neighbour
in
the
X
district
Yes
I
have
a
little
estate
there
she
said
near
Glinnoye
To
be
sure
to
be
sure
I
answered
I
know
your
Mihailovskoye
Do
you
stay
there
Rarely
You
were
there
three
years
ago
Wait
a
minute
I
believe
I
was
yes
I
was
Alone
or
with
your
sister
She
glanced
at
me
With
my
sister
We
went
down
there
for
a
week
you
know
on
business
But
we
saw
no
one
H
'm
You
have
very
few
neighbours
there
I
beheve
Yes
very
few
And
I
am
not
very
eager
to
see
them
Tell
me
I
began
I
believe
something
dreadful
happened
that
year
Lukyanitch
Madame
Shlykov
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
once
Did
you
know
him
she
asked
eagerly
What
a
dreadful
thing
He
was
such
a
splen
did
good
old
man
And
only
fancy
for
no
sort
of
reason
Yes
yes
I
muttered
a
dreadful
thing
Her
sister
came
up
to
us
She
was
prob
ably
bored
by
the
learned
disquisitions
of
the
geologist
on
the
formation
of
the
banks
of
the
Volga
Only
fancy
Pauline
Madame
Shlykov
be
gan
Monsieur
knew
Lukyanitch
Really
Poor
old
man
I
went
shooting
near
Mihailovskoye
more
than
once
at
the
time
you
were
there
three
years
ago
I
observed
I
said
Pelageya
in
some
perplexity
Why
yes
of
course
her
sister
put
in
hur
THREE
MEETINGS
rtedly
Do
n't
you
remember
and
she
looked
intently
into
her
eyes
Oh
yes
yes
to
be
sure
Pelageya
an
swered
all
at
once
Heigh-ho
I
thought
I
doubt
whether
you
were
there
my
dear
Wo
n't
you
sing
us
something
Pelageya
Fyodorovna
a
tall
young
man
with
a
shock
of
flaxen
hair
and
lustreless
sugary
eyes
said
suddenly
I
really
do
n't
know
said
Mademoiselle
Badayev
You
sing
I
exclaimed
eagerly
and
got
up
from
my
seat
For
Heaven
's
sake
oh
for
Heaven
's
sake
sing
us
something
Why
what
shall
I
sing
you
Do
n't
you
know
I
asked
doing
my
ut
most
to
appear
unconcerned
and
free
and
easy
an
Italian
song
it
begins
Passa
que
colli
Yes
I
know
it
answered
Pelageya
quite
innocently
Why
shall
I
sing
it
to
you
Cer
tainly
And
she
sat
down
to
the
piano
I
like
Ham
let
fastened
my
eyes
on
Madame
Shlykov
I
fancied
that
at
the
first
note
she
gave
a
faint
start
she
sat
through
it
quietly
however
Mademoiselle
Badayev
sang
well
The
song
ended
and
the
usual
applause
followed
Peo
ple
began
begging
her
to
sing
something
more
but
the
sisters
excTianged
glances
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
took
leave
As
they
were
going
out
of
the
room
I
overheard
the
word
Imp
or
tun
Well
deserved
I
thought
and
I
did
not
meet
them
again
Another
year
passed
I
went
to
live
in
Petersburg
Winter
came
on
and
masked
balls
began
Coming
out
from
a
friend
's
house
at
eleven
o'clock
one
evening
I
felt
so
depressed
that
I
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
the
masked
ball
at
the
Hall
of
Nobility
For
a
long
while
I
wandered
beside
the
columns
and
by
the
mir
rors
with
a
modestly
Byronic
expression
on
my
face
that
expression
which
as
far
as
I
can
observe
is
seen
even
in
the
most
well-bred
peo
ple
on
such
occasions
why
the
Lord
only
knows
for
a
long
while
I
hung
about
at
rare
intervals
shaking
off
with
a
jest
shrill
dominos
with
dubious
lace
and
dirty
gloves
and
at
still
THREE
MEETINGS
rarer
intervals
entering
into
conversation
with
them
myself
for
a
long
time
I
resigned
my
ears
to
the
hlare
of
the
trumpets
and
the
screech
of
the
fiddles
At
last
after
being
bored
tO
my
heart
's
content
and
having
acquired
a
headache
I
decided
to
go
home
and
and
I
stayed
on
I
saw
a
woman
in
a
black
domino
leaning
against
a
column
I
saw
her
stopped
went
up
to
her
and
will
the
readers
believe
me
at
once
recognised
her
as
my
unknown
lady
How
I
recognised
her
whether
from
the
look
she
cast
carelessly
upon
me
through
the
long
slits
in
the
mask
or
from
the
divine
curve
of
her
arm
and
shoul
ders
or
from
the
peculiar
feminine
grandeur
of
her
whole
figure
or
from
some
mysterious
prompting
that
suddenly
spoke
within
me
I
can
not
say
but
I
did
With
a
tremor
at
my
heart
I
walked
by
her
two
or
three
times
She
did
not
stir
in
her
attitude
there
was
some
thing
so
hopelessly
sorrowful
that
looking
at
her
I
involuntarily
recalled
two
lines
from
a
Spanish
ballad
Soy
un
cuadro
de
tristeza
Arrimado
a
la
pared
I
walked
behind
the
column
against
which
she
was
leaning
and
bending
down
close
to
her
ear
softly
pronounced
Passa
que
colli
She
started
all
over
and
turned
quickly
to
me
Our
eyes
met
so
close
that
I
was
able
to
detect
how
her
pupils
dilated
with
fear
She
stared
at
me
in
bewilderment
weakly
stretch
ing
out
one
hand
May
6th
184
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
eve
ning
in
Sorrento
in
the
Via
della
Croce
I
said
in
a
deliberate
voice
not
taking
my
eyes
off
her
then
in
Russia
in
X
province
at
the
hamlet
of
Mihailovskoye
on
July
12th
I
said
all
this
in
French
She
drew
a
little
back
scanned
me
from
head
to
foot
with
as
tonished
eyes
and
whispering
Vencz
walked
hurriedly
out
of
the
ballroom
I
followed
her
We
walked
in
silence
I
can
not
attempt
to
describe
my
feelings
as
I
walked
beside
her
A
lovely
vision
which
should
suddenly
become
a
living
reality
the
statue
of
Galatea
step
ping
down
from
the
pedestal
a
living
woman
before
the
eyes
of
Pygmalion
faint
with
ex
pectation
I
could
not
believe
my
senses
THREE
MEETINGS
I
could
hardly
breathe
We
walked
through
several
rooms
At
last
in
one
of
them
she
stopped
before
a
small
sofa
in
the
window
and
sat
down
I
sat
down
beside
her
She
slowly
turned
her
head
towards
me
and
looked
at
me
intently
Do
you
do
you
come
from
him
she
said
Her
voice
was
weak
and
uncertain
Her
question
confused
me
a
little
No
not
from
him
I
said
faltering
Do
you
know
him
Yes
I
answered
with
mysterious
impor
tance
I
wanted
to
keep
up
my
part
I
know
him
She
gazed
at
me
distrustfully
would
have
said
something
and
looked
down
You
were
expecting
him
in
Sorrento
I
went
on
You
saw
him
at
Mihailovskoye
you
went
for
a
ride
with
him
How
could
you
she
began
I
know
I
know
everything
Your
face
seems
somehow
familiar
to
me
she
went
on
but
no
No
I
