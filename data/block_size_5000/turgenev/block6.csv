further
wall
and
a
sofa
covered
with
American
leather
above
the
doors
and
between
the
windows
hung
three
portraits
in
oils
with
the
paint
peeling
off
two
representing
bishops
in
clerical
caps
and
one
a
Turk
in
a
turban
cardboard
boxes
were
lying
about
in
the
corners
there
were
chairs
of
different
sorts
and
a
crooked
legged
card
table
on
which
a
man
's
cap
was
lying
beside
an
unfinished
glass
of
kvass
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
followed
into
the
room
by
the
old
woman
in
the
red
dress
whom
he
had
noticed
at
the
gate
and
who
turned
out
to
be
a
very
unprepossessing
Jewess
with
sullen
pig-like
eyes
and
a
grey
moustache
over
her
puffy
upper
lip
Emilie
indicated
her
to
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
and
said
This
is
my
aunt
Madame
Fritsche
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
a
little
surprised
but
thought
it
his
duty
to
introduce
himself
Madame
Fritsche
looked
at
him
from
under
her
brows
made
no
response
but
asked
her
niece
in
Russian
whether
she
would
like
some
tea
Ah
yes
tea
answered
Emilie
You
will
have
some
tea
wo
n't
you
Mr
Officer
Yes
auntie
give
us
some
tea
But
why
are
you
standing
Mr
Officer
Sit
down
Oh
how
ceremonious
you
are
Let
me
take
off
my
fichu
When
Emilie
talked
she
continually
turned
her
head
from
one
side
to
another
and
jerked
her
shoulders
birds
make
similar
movements
when
they
sit
on
a
bare
branch
with
sunshine
all
round
them
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
sank
into
a
chair
and
assuming
a
becoming
air
of
dignity
that
is
leaning
on
his
cutlass
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
floor
he
began
to
speak
about
the
theft
But
Emilie
at
once
interrupted
him
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
it
's
all
right
Auntie
has
just
told
me
that
the
principal
things
have
been
found
Madame
Fritsche
mumbled
something
to
herself
and
went
out
of
the
room
And
there
was
no
need
to
go
to
the
police
at
all
but
I
ca
n't
control
myself
because
I
am
so
You
do
n't
understand
German
So
quick
immer
so
rasch
But
I
think
no
more
about
it
aber
auch
gar
nicht
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
looked
at
Emilie
Her
face
indeed
showed
no
trace
of
care
now
Everything
was
smiling
in
that
pretty
little
face
the
eyes
fringed
with
almost
white
lashes
and
the
lips
and
the
cheeks
and
the
chin
and
the
dimples
in
the
chin
and
even
the
tip
of
her
turned-up
nose
She
went
up
to
the
little
looking
glass
beside
the
cupboard
and
screwing
up
her
eyes
and
humming
through
her
teeth
began
tidying
her
hair
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
followed
her
movements
intently
He
found
her
very
charming
You
must
excuse
me
she
began
again
turning
from
side
to
side
before
the
looking
glass
for
having
so
brought
you
home
with
me
Perhaps
you
dislike
it
Oh
not
at
all
As
I
have
told
you
already
I
am
so
quick
I
act
first
and
think
afterwards
though
sometimes
I
do
n't
think
at
all
What
is
your
name
Mr
Officer
May
I
ask
you
she
added
going
up
to
him
and
folding
her
arms
My
name
is
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
Yergunov
Yergu
Oh
it
's
not
a
nice
name
I
mean
it
's
difficult
for
me
I
shall
call
you
Mr
Florestan
At
Riga
we
had
a
Mr
Florestan
He
sold
capital
gros-de-Naples
in
his
shop
and
was
a
handsome
man
as
good-looking
as
you
But
how
broad-shouldered
you
are
A
regular
sturdy
Russian
I
like
the
Russians
I
am
a
Russian
myself
my
papa
was
an
officer
But
my
hands
are
whiter
than
yours
She
raised
them
above
her
head
waved
them
several
times
in
the
air
so
as
to
drive
the
blood
from
them
and
at
once
dropped
them
Do
you
see
I
wash
them
with
Greek
scented
soap
Sniff
Oh
but
do
n't
kiss
them
I
did
not
do
it
for
that
Where
are
you
serving
In
the
fleet
in
the
nineteenth
Black
Sea
company
Oh
you
are
a
sailor
Well
do
you
get
a
good
salary
No
not
very
You
must
be
very
brave
One
can
see
it
at
once
from
your
eyes
What
thick
eyebrows
you
've
got
They
say
you
ought
to
grease
them
with
lard
overnight
to
make
them
grow
But
why
have
you
no
moustache
It
's
against
the
regulations
Oh
that
's
not
right
What
's
that
you
've
got
a
dagger
It
's
a
cutlass
a
cutlass
so
to
say
is
the
sailor
's
weapon
Ah
a
cutlass
Is
it
sharp
May
I
look
With
an
effort
biting
her
lip
and
screwing
up
her
eyes
she
drew
the
blade
out
of
the
scabbard
and
put
it
to
her
nose
Oh
how
blunt
I
can
kill
you
with
it
in
a
minute
She
waved
it
at
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
He
pretended
to
be
frightened
and
laughed
She
laughed
too
Ihr
habt
pardon
you
are
pardoned
she
pronounced
throwing
herself
into
a
majestic
attitude
There
take
your
weapon
And
how
old
are
you
she
asked
suddenly
Twenty-five
And
I
am
nineteen
How
funny
that
is
Ach
And
Emilie
went
off
into
such
a
ringing
laugh
that
she
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
did
not
get
up
from
his
chair
and
looked
still
more
intently
at
her
rosy
face
which
was
quivering
with
laughter
and
he
felt
more
and
more
attracted
by
her
All
at
once
Emilie
was
silent
and
humming
through
her
teeth
as
her
habit
was
went
back
to
the
looking
glass
Can
you
sing
Mr
Florestan
No
I
have
never
been
taught
Do
you
play
on
the
guitar
Not
that
either
I
can
I
have
a
guitar
set
with
perlenmutter
but
the
strings
are
broken
I
must
buy
some
new
ones
You
will
give
me
the
money
wo
n't
you
Mr
Officer
I
'll
sing
you
a
lovely
German
song
She
heaved
a
sigh
and
shut
her
eyes
Ah
such
a
lovely
one
But
you
can
dance
Not
that
either
Unm
glich
I
'll
teach
you
The
schottische
and
the
valse-cosaque
Tra-la-la
tra-la-la
Emilie
pirouetted
once
or
twice
Look
at
my
shoes
From
Warsaw
Oh
we
will
have
some
dancing
Mr
Florestan
But
what
are
you
going
to
call
me
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
grinned
and
blushed
to
his
ears
I
shall
call
you
lovely
Emilie
No
no
You
must
call
me
Mein
Sch
tzchen
mein
Zuckerp
ppchen
Repeat
it
after
me
With
the
greatest
pleasure
but
I
am
afraid
I
shall
find
it
difficult
Never
mind
never
mind
Say
Mein
Me-in
Zucker
Tsook-ker
P
ppchen
P
ppchen
P
ppchen
Poop
poop
That
I
ca
n't
manage
It
does
n't
sound
nice
No
You
must
you
must
Do
you
know
what
it
means
That
's
the
very
nicest
word
for
a
young
lady
in
German
I
'll
explain
it
to
you
afterwards
But
here
is
auntie
bringing
us
the
samovar
Bravo
Bravo
auntie
I
will
have
cream
with
my
tea
Is
there
any
cream
So
schweige
doch
answered
the
aunt
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
stayed
at
Madame
Fritsche
's
till
midnight
He
had
not
spent
such
a
pleasant
evening
since
his
arrival
at
Nikolaev
It
is
true
that
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
not
seemly
for
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
to
be
associating
with
such
persons
as
this
native
of
Riga
and
her
auntie
but
Emilie
was
so
pretty
babbled
so
amusingly
and
bestowed
such
friendly
looks
upon
him
that
he
dismissed
his
rank
and
family
and
made
up
his
mind
for
once
to
enjoy
himself
Only
one
circumstance
disturbed
him
and
left
an
impression
that
was
not
quite
agreeable
When
his
conversation
with
Emilie
and
Madame
Fritsche
was
in
full
swing
the
door
from
the
lobby
opened
a
crack
and
a
man
's
hand
in
a
dark
cuff
with
three
tiny
silver
buttons
on
it
was
stealthily
thrust
in
and
stealthily
laid
a
big
bundle
on
the
chair
near
the
door
Both
ladies
instantly
darted
to
the
chair
and
began
examining
the
bundle
But
these
are
the
wrong
spoons
cried
Emilie
but
her
aunt
nudged
her
with
her
elbow
and
carried
away
the
bundle
without
tying
up
the
ends
It
seemed
to
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
that
one
end
was
spattered
with
something
red
like
blood
What
is
it
he
asked
Emilie
Is
it
some
more
stolen
things
returned
to
you
Yes
answered
Emilie
as
it
were
reluctantly
Some
more
Was
it
your
servant
found
them
Emilie
frowned
What
servant
We
have
n't
any
servant
Some
other
man
then
No
men
come
to
see
us
But
excuse
me
excuse
me
I
saw
the
cuff
of
a
man
's
coat
or
jacket
And
besides
this
cap
Men
never
never
come
to
see
us
Emilie
repeated
emphatically
What
did
you
see
You
saw
nothing
And
that
cap
is
mine
How
is
that
Why
just
that
I
wear
it
for
dressing
up
Yes
it
is
mine
und
Punctum
Who
brought
you
the
bundle
then
Emilie
made
no
answer
and
pouting
followed
Madame
Fritsche
out
of
the
room
Ten
minutes
later
she
came
back
alone
without
her
aunt
and
when
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
tried
to
question
her
again
she
gazed
at
his
forehead
said
that
it
was
disgraceful
for
a
gentleman
to
be
so
inquisitive
as
she
said
this
her
face
changed
a
little
as
it
were
darkened
and
taking
a
pack
of
old
cards
from
the
card
table
drawer
asked
him
to
tell
fortunes
for
her
and
the
king
of
hearts
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
laughed
took
the
cards
and
all
evil
thoughts
immediately
slipped
out
of
his
mind
But
they
came
back
to
him
that
very
day
When
he
had
got
out
of
the
gate
into
the
street
had
said
good-bye
to
Emilie
shouted
to
her
for
the
last
time
Adieu
Zuckerp
ppchen
a
short
man
darted
by
him
and
turning
for
a
minute
in
his
direction
it
was
past
midnight
but
the
moon
was
shining
rather
brightly
displayed
a
lean
gipsy
face
with
thick
black
eyebrows
and
moustache
black
eyes
and
a
hooked
nose
The
man
at
once
rushed
round
the
corner
and
it
struck
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
that
he
recognised
not
his
face
for
he
had
never
seen
it
before
but
the
cuff
of
his
sleeve
Three
silver
buttons
gleamed
distinctly
in
the
moonlight
There
was
a
stir
of
uneasy
perplexity
in
the
soul
of
the
prudent
lieutenant
when
he
got
home
he
did
not
light
as
usual
his
meerschaum
pipe
Though
indeed
his
sudden
acquaintance
with
charming
Emilie
and
the
agreeable
hours
spent
in
her
company
would
alone
have
induced
his
agitation
Whatever
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
's
apprehensions
may
have
been
they
were
quickly
dissipated
and
left
no
trace
He
took
to
visiting
the
two
ladies
from
Riga
frequently
The
susceptible
lieutenant
was
soon
on
friendly
terms
with
Emilie
At
first
he
was
ashamed
of
the
acquaintance
and
concealed
his
visits
later
on
he
got
over
being
ashamed
and
no
longer
concealed
his
visits
it
ended
by
his
being
more
eager
to
spend
his
time
with
his
new
friends
than
with
anyone
and
greatly
preferring
their
society
to
the
cheerless
solitude
of
his
own
four
walls
Madame
Fritsche
herself
no
longer
made
the
same
unpleasant
impression
upon
him
though
she
still
treated
him
morosely
and
ungraciously
Persons
in
straitened
circumstances
like
Madame
Fritsche
particularly
appreciate
a
liberal
expenditure
in
their
visitors
and
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
a
little
stingy
and
his
presents
for
the
most
part
took
the
shape
of
raisins
walnuts
cakes
Only
once
he
let
himself
go
and
presented
Emilie
with
a
light
pink
fichu
of
real
French
material
and
that
very
day
she
had
burnt
a
hole
in
his
gift
with
a
candle
He
began
to
upbraid
her
she
fixed
the
fichu
to
the
cat's
tail
he
was
angry
she
laughed
in
his
face
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
forced
at
last
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
had
not
only
failed
to
win
the
respect
of
the
ladies
from
Riga
but
had
even
failed
to
gain
their
confidence
he
was
never
admitted
at
once
without
preliminary
scrutinising
he
was
often
kept
waiting
sometimes
he
was
sent
away
without
the
slightest
ceremony
and
when
they
wanted
to
conceal
something
from
him
they
would
converse
in
German
in
his
presence
Emilie
gave
him
no
account
of
her
doings
and
replied
to
his
questions
in
an
offhand
way
as
though
she
had
not
heard
them
and
worst
of
all
some
of
the
rooms
in
Madame
Fritsche
's
house
which
was
a
fairly
large
one
though
it
looked
like
a
hovel
from
the
street
were
never
opened
to
him
For
all
that
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
did
not
give
up
his
visits
on
the
contrary
he
paid
them
more
and
more
frequently
he
was
seeing
living
people
anyway
His
vanity
was
gratified
by
Emilie
's
continuing
to
call
him
Florestan
considering
him
exceptionally
handsome
and
declaring
that
he
had
eyes
like
a
bird
of
paradise
wie
die
Augen
eines
Paradiesvogels
One
day
in
the
very
height
of
summer
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
who
had
spent
the
whole
morning
in
the
sun
with
contractors
and
workmen
dragged
himself
tired
and
exhausted
to
the
little
gate
that
had
become
so
familiar
to
him
He
knocked
and
was
admitted
He
shambled
into
the
so-called
drawing-room
and
immediately
lay
down
on
the
sofa
Emilie
went
up
to
him
and
mopped
his
wet
brow
with
a
handkerchief
How
tired
he
is
poor
pet
How
hot
he
is
she
said
commiseratingly
Good
gracious
You
might
at
least
unbutton
your
collar
My
goodness
how
your
throat
is
pulsing
I
am
done
up
my
dear
groaned
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
I
've
been
on
my
feet
all
the
morning
in
the
baking
sun
It
's
awful
I
meant
to
go
home
But
there
those
vipers
the
contractors
would
find
me
While
here
with
you
it
is
cool
I
believe
I
could
have
a
nap
Well
why
not
Go
to
sleep
my
little
chick
no
one
will
disturb
you
here
But
I
am
really
ashamed
What
next
Why
ashamed
Go
to
sleep
And
I
'll
sing
you
what
do
you
call
it
I
'll
sing
you
to
bye-bye
Schlaf
mein
Kindchen
Schlafe
She
began
singing
I
should
like
a
drink
of
water
first
Here
is
a
glass
of
water
for
you
Fresh
as
crystal
Wait
I
'll
put
a
pillow
under
your
head
And
here
is
this
to
keep
the
flies
off
She
covered
his
face
with
a
handkerchief
Thank
you
my
little
cupid
I
'll
just
have
a
tiny
doze
that's
all
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
immediately
Schlaf
mein
Kindchen
schlafe
sang
Emilie
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
softly
laughing
at
her
song
and
her
movements
What
a
big
baby
I
have
got
she
thought
A
boy
An
hour
and
a
half
later
the
lieutenant
awoke
He
fancied
in
his
sleep
that
someone
touched
him
bent
over
him
breathed
over
him
He
fumbled
and
pulled
off
the
kerchief
Emilie
was
on
her
knees
close
beside
him
the
expression
of
her
face
struck
him
as
queer
She
jumped
up
at
once
walked
away
to
the
window
and
put
something
away
in
her
pocket
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
stretched
I
've
had
a
good
long
snooze
it
seems
he
observed
yawning
Come
here
meine
z
sse
Fr
ulein
Emilie
went
up
to
him
He
sat
up
quickly
thrust
his
hand
into
her
pocket
and
took
out
a
small
pair
of
scissors
Ach
Herr
Je
Emilie
could
not
help
exclaiming
It
's
it
's
a
pair
of
scissors
muttered
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
Why
of
course
What
did
you
think
it
was
a
pistol
Oh
how
funny
you
look
You
're
as
rumpled
as
a
pillow
and
your
hair
is
all
standing
up
at
the
back
And
he
does
n't
laugh
Oh
oh
And
his
eyes
are
puffy
Oh
Emilie
went
off
into
a
giggle
Come
that
's
enough
muttered
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
and
he
got
up
from
the
sofa
That
's
enough
giggling
about
nothing
If
you
can't
think
of
anything
more
sensible
I
'll
go
home
I
'll
go
home
he
repeated
seeing
that
she
was
still
laughing
Emilie
subsided
Come
stay
I
wo
n't
Only
you
must
brush
your
hair
No
never
mind
Do
n't
trouble
I
'd
better
go
said
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
and
he
took
up
his
cap
Emilie
pouted
Fie
how
cross
he
is
A
regular
Russian
All
Russians
are
cross
Now
he
is
going
Fie
Yesterday
he
promised
me
five
roubles
and
today
he
gives
me
nothing
and
goes
away
I
have
n't
any
money
on
me
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
muttered
grumpily
in
the
doorway
Good-bye
Emilie
looked
after
him
and
shook
her
finger
No
money
Do
you
hear
do
you
hear
what
he
says
Oh
what
deceivers
these
Russians
are
But
wait
a
bit
you
pug
Auntie
come
here
I
have
something
to
tell
you
That
evening
as
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
undressing
to
go
to
bed
he
noticed
that
the
upper
edge
of
his
leather
belt
had
come
unsewn
for
about
three
inches
Like
a
careful
man
he
at
once
procured
a
needle
and
thread
waxed
the
thread
and
stitched
up
the
hole
himself
He
paid
however
no
attention
to
this
apparently
trivial
circumstance
The
whole
of
the
next
day
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
devoted
to
his
official
duties
he
did
not
leave
the
house
even
after
dinner
and
right
into
the
night
was
scribbling
and
copying
out
his
report
to
his
superior
officer
mercilessly
disregarding
the
rules
of
spelling
always
putting
an
exclamation
mark
after
the
word
but
and
a
semi-colon
after
however
Next
morning
a
barefoot
Jewish
boy
in
a
tattered
gown
brought
him
a
letter
from
Emilie
the
first
letter
that
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
had
received
from
her
Mein
allerliebstep
Florestan
she
wrote
to
him
can
you
really
so
cross
with
your
Zuckerp
ppchen
be
that
you
came
not
yesterday
Please
be
not
cross
if
you
wish
not
your
merry
Emilie
to
weep
very
bitterly
and
come
be
sure
at
5
o'clock
to-day
The
figure
5
was
surrounded
with
two
wreaths
I
will
be
very
very
glad
Your
amiable
Emilie
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
inwardly
surprised
at
the
accomplishments
of
his
charmer
gave
the
Jew
boy
a
copper
coin
and
told
him
to
say
Very
well
I
will
come
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
kept
his
word
five
o'clock
had
not
struck
when
he
was
standing
before
Madame
Fritsche
's
gate
But
to
his
surprise
he
did
not
find
Emilie
at
home
he
was
met
by
the
lady
of
the
house
herself
who
wonder
of
wonders
dropping
a
preliminary
curtsey
informed
him
that
Emilie
had
been
obliged
by
unforeseen
circumstances
to
go
out
but
she
would
soon
be
back
and
begged
him
to
wait
Madame
Fritsche
had
on
a
neat
white
cap
she
smiled
spoke
in
an
ingratiating
voice
and
evidently
tried
to
give
an
affable
expression
to
her
morose
countenance
which
was
however
none
the
more
prepossessing
for
that
but
on
the
contrary
acquired
a
positively
sinister
aspect
Sit
down
sit
down
sir
she
said
putting
an
easy
chair
for
him
and
we
will
offer
you
some
refreshment
if
you
will
permit
it
Madame
Fritsche
made
another
curtsey
went
out
of
the
room
and
returned
shortly
afterwards
with
a
cup
of
chocolate
on
a
small
iron
tray
The
chocolate
turned
out
to
be
of
dubious
quality
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
drank
the
whole
cup
with
relish
however
though
he
was
at
a
loss
to
explain
why
Madame
Fritsche
was
suddenly
so
affable
and
what
it
all
meant
For
all
that
Emilie
did
not
come
back
and
he
was
beginning
to
lose
patience
and
feel
bored
when
all
at
once
he
heard
through
the
wall
the
sounds
of
a
guitar
First
there
was
the
sound
of
one
chord
then
a
second
and
a
third
and
a
fourth
the
sound
continually
growing
louder
and
fuller
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
surprised
Emilie
certainly
had
a
guitar
but
it
only
had
three
strings
he
had
not
yet
bought
her
any
new
ones
besides
Emilie
was
not
at
home
Who
could
it
be
Again
a
chord
was
struck
and
so
loudly
that
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
in
the
room
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
turned
round
and
almost
cried
out
in
a
fright
Before
him
in
a
low
doorway
which
he
had
not
till
then
noticed
a
big
cupboard
screened
it
stood
a
strange
figure
neither
a
child
nor
a
grown-up
girl
She
was
wearing
a
white
dress
with
a
bright-coloured
pattern
on
it
and
red
shoes
with
high
heels
her
thick
black
hair
held
together
by
a
gold
fillet
fell
like
a
cloak
from
her
little
head
over
her
slender
body
Her
big
eyes
shone
with
sombre
brilliance
under
the
soft
mass
of
hair
her
bare
dark-skinned
arms
were
loaded
with
bracelets
and
her
hands
covered
with
rings
held
a
guitar
Her
face
was
scarcely
visible
it
looked
so
small
and
dark
all
that
was
seen
was
the
crimson
of
her
lips
and
the
outline
of
a
straight
and
narrow
nose
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
stood
for
some
time
petrified
and
stared
at
the
strange
creature
without
blinking
and
she
too
gazed
at
him
without
stirring
an
eyelid
At
last
he
recovered
himself
and
moved
with
small
steps
towards
her
The
dark
face
began
gradually
smiling
There
was
a
sudden
gleam
of
white
teeth
the
little
head
was
raised
and
lightly
flinging
back
the
curls
displayed
itself
in
all
its
startling
and
delicate
beauty
What
little
imp
is
this
thought
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
and
advancing
still
closer
he
brought
out
in
a
low
voice
Hey
little
image
Who
are
you
Come
here
come
here
the
little
image
responded
in
a
rather
husky
voice
with
a
halting
un-Russian
intonation
and
incorrect
accent
and
she
stepped
back
two
paces
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
followed
her
through
the
doorway
and
found
himself
in
a
tiny
room
without
windows
the
walls
and
floor
of
which
were
covered
with
thick
camel's-hair
rugs
He
was
overwhelmed
by
a
strong
smell
of
musk
Two
yellow
wax
candles
were
burning
on
a
round
table
in
front
of
a
low
sofa
In
the
corner
stood
a
bedstead
under
a
muslin
canopy
with
silk
stripes
and
a
long
amber
rosary
with
a
red
tassle
at
the
end
hung
by
the
pillow
But
excuse
me
who
are
you
repeated
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
Sister
sister
of
Emilie
You
are
her
sister
And
you
live
here
Yes
yes
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
wanted
to
touch
the
image
She
drew
back
How
is
it
she
has
never
spoken
of
you
Could
not
could
not
You
are
in
concealment
then
in
hiding
Yes
Are
there
reasons
Reasons
reasons
Hm
Again
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
would
have
touched
the
figure
again
she
stepped
back
So
that
's
why
I
never
saw
you
I
must
own
I
never
suspected
your
existence
And
the
old
lady
Madame
Fritsche
is
your
aunt
too
Yes
aunt
Hm
You
do
n't
seem
to
understand
Russian
very
well
What
's
your
name
allow
me
to
ask
Colibri
What
Colibri
Colibri
That
's
an
out-of-the-way
name
There
are
insects
like
that
in
Africa
if
I
remember
right
Colibri
gave
a
short
queer
laugh
like
a
clink
of
glass
in
her
throat
She
shook
her
head
looked
round
laid
her
guitar
on
the
table
and
going
quickly
to
the
door
abruptly
shut
it
She
moved
briskly
and
nimbly
with
a
rapid
hardly
audible
sound
like
a
lizard
at
the
back
her
hair
fell
below
her
knees
Why
have
you
shut
the
door
asked
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
Colibri
put
her
fingers
to
her
lips
Emilie
not
want
not
want
her
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
grinned
I
say
you
are
not
jealous
are
you
Colibri
raised
her
eyebrows
What
Jealous
angry
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
explained
Oh
yes
Really
Much
obliged
I
say
how
old
are
you
Seventen
Seventeen
you
mean
Yes
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
scrutinised
his
fantastic
companion
closely
What
a
beautiful
creature
you
are
he
said
emphatically
Marvellous
Really
marvellous
What
hair
What
eyes
And
your
eyebrows
ough
Colibri
laughed
again
and
again
looked
round
with
her
magnificent
eyes
Yes
I
am
a
beauty
Sit
down
and
I
'll
sit
down
beside
By
all
means
But
say
what
you
like
you
are
a
strange
sister
for
Emilie
You
are
not
in
the
least
like
her
Yes
I
am
sister
cousin
Here
take
a
flower
A
nice
flower
It
smells
She
took
out
of
her
girdle
a
sprig
of
white
lilac
sniffed
it
bit
off
a
petal
and
gave
him
the
whole
sprig
Will
you
have
jam
Nice
jam
from
Constantinople
sorbet
Colibri
took
from
the
small
chest
of
drawers
a
gilt
jar
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
crimson
silk
with
steel
spangles
on
it
a
silver
spoon
a
cut
glass
decanter
and
a
tumbler
like
it
Eat
some
sorbet
sir
it
is
fine
I
will
sing
to
you
Will
you
She
took
up
the
guitar
You
sing
then
asked
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
putting
a
spoonful
of
really
excellent
sorbet
into
his
mouth
Oh
yes
She
flung
back
her
mane
of
hair
put
her
head
on
one
side
and
struck
several
chords
looking
carefully
at
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
at
the
top
of
the
guitar
then
suddenly
began
singing
in
a
voice
unexpectedly
strong
and
agreeable
but
guttural
and
to
the
ears
of
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
rather
savage
Oh
you
pretty
kitten
he
thought
She
sang
a
mournful
song
utterly
un-Russian
and
in
a
language
quite
unknown
to
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
He
used
to
declare
that
the
sounds
Kha
gha
kept
recurring
in
it
and
at
the
end
she
repeated
a
long
drawn-out
sintamar
or
sintsimar
or
something
of
the
sort
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand
heaved
a
sigh
and
let
the
guitar
drop
on
her
knee
Good
she
asked
want
more
I
should
be
delighted
answered
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
But
why
do
you
look
like
that
as
though
you
were
grieving
You
'd
better
have
some
sorbet
No
you
And
I
will
again
It
will
be
more
merry
She
sang
another
song
that
sounded
like
a
dance
in
the
same
unknown
language
Again
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
distinguished
the
same
guttural
sounds
Her
swarthy
fingers
fairly
raced
over
the
strings
like
little
spiders
and
she
ended
up
this
time
with
a
jaunty
shout
of
Ganda
or
Gassa
and
with
flashing
eyes
banged
on
the
table
with
her
little
fist
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
sat
as
though
he
were
in
a
dream
His
head
was
going
round
It
was
all
so
unexpected
And
the
scent
the
singing
the
candles
in
the
daytime
the
sorbet
flavoured
with
vanilla
And
Colibri
kept
coming
closer
to
him
too
her
hair
shone
and
rustled
and
there
was
a
glow
of
warmth
from
her
and
that
melancholy
face
A
russalka
thought
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
He
felt
somewhat
awkward
Tell
me
my
pretty
what
put
it
into
your
head
to
invite
me
to-day
You
are
young
pretty
such
I
like
So
that
's
it
But
what
will
Emilie
say
She
wrote
me
a
letter
she
is
sure
to
be
back
directly
You
not
tell
her
nothing
Trouble
She
will
kill
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
laughed
As
though
she
were
so
fierce
Colibri
gravely
shook
her
head
several
times
And
to
Madame
Fritsche
too
nothing
No
no
no
She
tapped
herself
lightly
on
the
forehead
Do
you
understand
officer
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
frowned
It
's
a
secret
then
Yes
yes
Very
well
I
wo
n't
say
a
word
Only
you
ought
to
give
me
a
kiss
for
that
No
afterwards
when
you
are
gone
That
's
a
fine
idea
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
was
bending
down
to
her
but
she
slowly
drew
herself
back
and
stood
stiffly
erect
like
a
snake
startled
in
the
grass
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
stared
at
her
Well
he
said
at
last
you
are
a
spiteful
thing
All
right
then
Colibri
pondered
and
turned
to
the
lieutenant
All
at
once
there
was
the
muffled
sound
of
tapping
repeated
three
times
at
even
intervals
somewhere
in
the
house
Colibri
laughed
almost
snorted
To-day
no
to-morrow
yes
Come
to-morrow
At
what
time
Seven
in
the
evening
And
what
about
Emilie
Emilie
no
will
not
be
here
You
think
so
Very
well
Only
to-morrow
you
will
tell
me
What
Colibri
's
face
assumed
a
childish
expression
every
time
she
asked
a
question
Why
you
have
been
hiding
away
from
me
all
this
time
Yes
yes
everything
shall
be
to-morrow
the
end
shall
be
Mind
now
And
I
'll
bring
you
a
present
No
no
need
Why
not
I
see
you
like
fine
clothes
No
need
This
this
this
she
pointed
to
her
dress
her
rings
her
bracelets
and
everything
about
her
it
is
all
my
own
Not
a
present
I
do
not
take
As
you
like
And
now
must
I
go
Oh
yes
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
got
up
Colibri
got
up
too
Good-bye
pretty
little
doll
And
when
will
you
give
me
a
kiss
Colibri
suddenly
gave
a
little
jump
and
swiftly
flinging
both
arms
round
his
neck
gave
him
not
precisely
a
kiss
but
a
peck
at
his
lips
He
tried
in
his
turn
to
kiss
her
but
she
instantly
darted
back
and
stood
behind
the
sofa
To-morrow
at
seven
o'clock
then
he
said
with
some
confusion
She
nodded
and
taking
a
tress
of
her
long
hair
with
her
two
fingers
bit
it
with
her
sharp
teeth
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
kissed
his
hand
to
her
went
out
and
shut
the
door
after
him
He
heard
Colibri
run
up
to
it
at
once
The
key
clicked
in
the
lock
There
was
no
one
in
Madame
Fritsche
's
drawing-room
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
made
his
way
to
the
passage
at
once
He
did
not
want
to
meet
Emilie
Madame
Fritsche
met
him
on
the
steps
Ah
you
are
going
Mr
Lieutenant
she
said
with
the
same
affected
and
sinister
smile
You
wo
n't
wait
for
Emilie
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
put
on
his
cap
I
have
n't
time
to
wait
any
longer
madam
I
may
not
come
to-morrow
either
Please
tell
her
so
Very
good
I
'll
tell
her
But
I
hope
you
have
n't
been
dull
Mr
Lieutenant
No
I
have
not
been
dull
I
thought
not
Good-bye
Good-bye
Kuzma
Vassilyevitch
returned
home
and
stretching
himself
on
his
bed
sank
into
meditation
He
was
unutterably
perplexed
What
