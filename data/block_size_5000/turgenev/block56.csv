man
in
a
pleasant
ringing
voice
How
do
you
like
my
new
purchase
Marya
Dmitrievna
went
up
to
the
window
How
do
you
do
Woldemar
Ah
what
a
splendid
horse
Where
did
you
buy
it
I
bought
it
from
the
army
contractor
He
made
me
pay
for
it
too
the
brigand
What
s
its
name
Orlando
But
it
s
a
stupid
name
I
want
to
change
Eh
bien
eh
bien
mon
garcon
What
a
restless
beast
it
is
The
horse
snorted
pawed
the
ground
and
shook
the
foam
off
the
bit
Lenotchka
stroke
him
don
t
be
afraid
The
little
girl
stretched
her
hand
out
of
the
window
but
Orlando
suddenly
reared
and
started
The
rider
with
perfect
self-possession
gave
it
a
cut
with
the
whip
across
the
neck
and
keeping
a
tight
grip
with
his
legs
forced
it
in
spite
of
its
opposition
to
stand
still
again
at
the
window
Prenez
garde
prenez
garde
Marya
Dmitrievna
kept
repeating
Lenotchka
pat
him
said
the
young
man
I
won
t
let
him
be
perverse
The
little
girl
again
stretched
out
her
hand
and
timidly
patted
the
quivering
nostrils
of
the
horse
who
kept
fidgeting
and
champing
the
bit
Bravo
cried
Marya
Dmitrievna
but
now
get
off
and
come
in
to
us
The
rider
adroitly
turned
his
horse
gave
him
a
touch
of
the
spur
and
galloping
down
the
street
soon
reached
the
courtyard
A
minute
later
he
ran
into
the
drawing-room
by
the
door
from
the
hall
flourishing
his
whip
at
the
same
moment
there
appeared
in
the
other
doorway
a
tall
slender
dark-haired
girl
of
nineteen
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
eldest
daughter
Lisa
The
name
of
the
young
man
whom
we
have
just
introduced
to
the
reader
was
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
Panshin
He
served
in
Petersburg
on
special
commissions
in
the
department
of
internal
affairs
He
had
come
to
the
town
of
O
to
carry
out
some
temporary
government
commissions
and
was
in
attendance
on
the
Governor-General
Zonnenberg
to
whom
he
happened
to
be
distantly
related
Panshin
s
father
a
retired
cavalry
officer
and
a
notorious
gambler
was
a
man
with
insinuating
eyes
a
battered
countenance
and
a
nervous
twitch
about
the
mouth
He
spent
his
whole
life
hanging
about
the
aristocratic
world
frequented
the
English
clubs
of
both
capitals
and
had
the
reputation
of
a
smart
not
very
trustworthy
but
jolly
good-natured
fellow
In
spite
of
his
smartness
he
was
almost
always
on
the
brink
of
ruin
and
the
property
he
left
his
son
was
small
and
heavily-encumbered
To
make
up
for
that
however
he
did
exert
himself
after
his
own
fashion
over
his
son
s
education
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
spoke
French
very
well
English
well
and
German
badly
that
is
the
proper
thing
fashionable
people
would
be
ashamed
to
speak
German
well
but
to
utter
an
occasional
generally
a
humorous
phrase
in
German
is
quite
correct
c
est
meme
tres
chic
as
the
Parisians
of
Petersburg
express
themselves
By
the
time
he
was
fifteen
Vladimir
knew
how
to
enter
any
drawing-room
without
embarrassment
how
to
move
about
in
it
gracefully
and
to
leave
it
at
the
appropriate
moment
Panshin
s
father
gained
many
connections
for
his
son
He
never
lost
an
opportunity
while
shuffling
the
cards
between
two
rubbers
or
playing
a
successful
trump
of
dropping
a
hint
about
his
Volodka
to
any
personage
of
importance
who
was
a
devotee
of
cards
And
Vladimir
too
during
his
residence
at
the
university
which
he
left
without
a
very
brilliant
degree
formed
an
acquaintance
with
several
young
men
of
quality
and
gained
an
entry
into
the
best
houses
He
was
received
cordially
everywhere
he
was
very
good-looking
easy
in
his
manners
amusing
always
in
good
health
and
ready
for
everything
respectful
when
he
ought
to
be
insolent
when
he
dared
to
be
excellent
company
un
charmant
garcon
The
promised
land
lay
before
him
Panshin
quickly
learnt
the
secret
of
getting
on
in
the
world
he
knew
how
to
yield
with
genuine
respect
to
its
decrees
he
knew
how
to
take
up
trifles
with
half
ironical
seriousness
and
to
appear
to
regard
everything
serious
as
trifling
he
was
a
capital
dancer
and
dressed
in
the
English
style
In
a
short
time
he
gained
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
smartest
and
most
attractive
young
men
in
Petersburg
Panshin
was
indeed
very
smart
not
less
so
than
his
father
but
he
was
also
very
talented
He
did
everything
well
he
sang
charmingly
sketched
with
spirit
wrote
verses
and
was
a
very
fair
actor
He
was
only
twenty-eight
and
he
was
already
a
kammer-yunker
and
had
a
very
good
position
Panshin
had
complete
confidence
in
himself
in
his
own
intelligence
and
his
own
penetration
he
made
his
way
with
light-hearted
assurance
everything
went
smoothly
with
him
He
was
used
to
being
liked
by
every
one
old
and
young
and
imagined
that
he
understood
people
especially
women
he
certainly
understood
their
ordinary
weaknesses
As
a
man
of
artistic
leanings
he
was
conscious
of
a
capacity
for
passion
for
being
carried
away
even
for
enthusiasm
and
consequently
he
permitted
himself
various
irregularities
he
was
dissipated
associated
with
persons
not
belonging
to
good
society
and
in
general
conducted
himself
in
a
free
and
easy
manner
but
at
heart
he
was
cold
and
false
and
at
the
moment
of
the
most
boisterous
revelry
his
sharp
brown
eye
was
always
alert
taking
everything
in
This
bold
independent
young
man
could
never
forget
himself
and
be
completely
carried
away
To
his
credit
it
must
be
said
that
he
never
boasted
of
his
conquests
He
had
found
his
way
into
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
house
immediately
he
arrived
in
O
and
was
soon
perfectly
at
home
there
Marya
Dmitrievna
absolutely
adored
him
Panshin
exchanged
cordial
greetings
with
every
one
in
the
room
he
shook
hands
with
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
clapped
Gedeonovsky
lightly
on
the
shoulder
and
turning
round
on
his
heels
put
his
hand
on
Lenotchka
s
head
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
Aren
t
you
afraid
to
ride
such
a
vicious
horse
Marya
Dmitrievna
questioned
him
I
assure
you
he
s
very
quiet
but
I
will
tell
you
what
I
am
afraid
of
I
m
afraid
to
play
preference
with
Sergei
Petrovitch
yesterday
he
cleaned
me
out
of
everything
at
Madame
Byelenitsin
s
Gedeonovsky
gave
a
thin
sympathetic
little
laugh
he
was
anxious
to
be
in
favour
with
the
brilliant
young
official
from
Petersburg
the
governor
s
favourite
In
conversation
with
Marya
Dmitrievna
he
often
alluded
to
Panshin
s
remarkable
abilities
Indeed
he
used
to
argue
how
can
one
help
admiring
him
The
young
man
is
making
his
way
in
the
highest
spheres
he
is
an
exemplary
official
and
not
a
bit
of
pride
about
him
And
in
fact
even
in
Petersburg
Panshin
was
reckoned
a
capable
official
he
got
through
a
great
deal
of
work
he
spoke
of
it
lightly
as
befits
a
man
of
the
world
who
does
not
attach
any
special
importance
to
his
labours
but
he
never
hesitated
in
carrying
out
orders
The
authorities
like
such
subordinates
he
himself
had
no
doubt
that
if
he
chose
he
could
be
a
minister
in
time
You
are
pleased
to
say
that
I
cleaned
you
out
replied
Gedeonovsky
but
who
was
it
won
twelve
roubles
of
me
last
week
and
more
You
re
a
malicious
fellow
Panshin
interrupted
with
genial
but
somewhat
contemptuous
carelessness
and
paying
him
no
further
attention
he
went
up
to
Lisa
I
can
not
get
the
overture
of
Oberon
here
he
began
Madame
Byelenitsin
was
boasting
when
she
said
she
had
all
the
classical
music
in
reality
she
has
nothing
but
polkas
and
waltzes
but
I
have
already
written
to
Moscow
and
within
a
week
you
will
have
the
overture
By
the
way
he
went
on
I
wrote
a
new
song
yesterday
the
words
too
are
mine
would
you
care
for
me
to
sing
it
I
don
t
know
how
far
it
is
successful
Madame
Byelenitsin
thought
it
very
pretty
but
her
words
mean
nothing
I
should
like
to
know
what
you
think
of
it
But
I
think
though
that
had
better
be
later
on
Why
later
on
interposed
Marya
Dmitrievna
why
not
now
I
obey
replied
Panshin
with
a
peculiar
bright
and
sweet
smile
which
came
and
went
suddenly
on
his
face
He
drew
up
a
chair
with
his
knee
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
striking
a
few
chords
began
to
sing
articulating
the
words
clearly
the
following
song
Above
the
earth
the
moon
floats
high
Amid
pale
clouds
Its
magic
light
in
that
far
sky
Yet
stirs
the
floods
My
heart
has
found
a
moon
to
rule
Its
stormy
sea
To
joy
and
sorrow
it
is
moved
Only
by
thee
My
soul
is
full
of
love
s
cruel
smart
And
longing
vain
But
thou
art
calm
as
that
cold
moon
That
knows
not
pain
The
second
couplet
was
sung
by
Panshin
with
special
power
and
expression
the
sound
of
waves
was
heard
in
the
stormy
accompaniment
After
the
words
and
longing
vain
he
sighed
softly
dropped
his
eyes
and
let
his
voice
gradually
die
away
morendo
When
he
had
finished
Lisa
praised
the
motive
Marya
Dmitrievna
cried
Charming
but
Gedeonovsky
went
so
far
as
to
exclaim
Ravishing
poetry
and
music
equally
ravishing
Lenotchka
looked
with
childish
reverence
at
the
singer
In
short
every
one
present
was
delighted
with
the
young
dilettante
s
composition
but
at
the
door
leading
into
the
drawing-room
from
the
hall
stood
an
old
man
who
had
only
just
come
in
and
who
to
judge
by
the
expression
of
his
downcast
face
and
the
shrug
of
his
shoulders
was
by
no
means
pleased
with
Panshin
s
song
pretty
though
it
was
After
waiting
a
moment
and
flicking
the
dust
off
his
boots
with
a
coarse
pocket-handkerchief
this
man
suddenly
raised
his
eyes
compressed
his
lips
with
a
morose
expression
and
his
stooping
figure
bent
forward
he
entered
the
drawing-room
Ah
Christopher
Fedoritch
how
are
you
exclaimed
Panshin
before
any
of
the
others
could
speak
and
he
jumped
up
quickly
from
his
seat
I
had
no
suspicion
that
you
were
here
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
sing
my
song
before
you
I
know
you
are
no
lover
of
light
music
I
did
not
hear
it
declared
the
new-comer
in
very
bad
Russian
and
exchanging
greetings
with
every
one
he
stood
awkwardly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
Have
you
come
Monsieur
Lemm
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
to
give
Lisa
her
music
lesson
No
not
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
but
Elena
Mihalovna
Oh
very
well
Lenotchka
go
up-stairs
with
Mr
Lemm
The
old
man
was
about
to
follow
the
little
girl
but
Panshin
stopped
him
Don
t
go
after
the
lesson
Christopher
Fedoritch
he
said
Lisa
Mihalovna
and
I
are
going
to
play
a
duet
of
Beethoven
s
sonata
The
old
man
muttered
some
reply
and
Panshin
continued
in
German
mispronouncing
the
words
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
showed
me
the
religious
cantata
you
dedicated
to
her
a
beautiful
thing
Pray
do
not
suppose
that
I
can
not
appreciate
serious
music
quite
the
contrary
it
is
tedious
sometimes
but
then
it
is
very
elevating
The
old
man
crimsoned
to
his
ears
and
with
a
sidelong
look
at
Lisa
he
hurriedly
went
out
of
the
room
Marya
Dmitrievna
asked
Panshin
to
sing
his
song
again
but
he
protested
that
he
did
not
wish
to
torture
the
ears
of
the
musical
German
and
suggested
to
Lisa
that
they
should
attack
Beethoven
s
sonata
Then
Marya
Dmitrievna
heaved
a
sigh
and
in
her
turn
suggested
to
Gedeonovsky
a
walk
in
the
garden
I
should
like
she
said
to
have
a
little
more
talk
and
to
consult
you
about
our
poor
Fedya
Gedeonovsky
bowed
with
a
smirk
and
with
two
fingers
picked
up
his
hat
on
the
brim
of
which
his
gloves
had
been
tidily
laid
and
went
away
with
Marya
Dmitrievna
Panshin
and
Lisa
remained
alone
in
the
room
she
fetched
the
sonata
and
opened
it
both
seated
themselves
at
the
piano
in
silence
Overhead
were
heard
the
faint
sounds
of
scales
played
by
the
uncertain
fingers
of
Lenotchka
Christopher
Theodor
Gottlieb
Lemm
was
born
in
1786
in
the
town
of
Chemnitz
in
Saxony
His
parents
were
poor
musicians
His
father
played
the
French
horn
his
mother
the
harp
he
himself
was
practising
on
three
different
instruments
by
the
time
he
was
five
At
eight
years
old
he
was
left
an
orphan
and
from
his
tenth
year
he
began
to
earn
his
bread
by
his
art
He
led
a
wandering
life
for
many
years
and
performed
everywhere
in
restaurants
at
fairs
at
peasants
weddings
and
at
balls
At
last
he
got
into
an
orchestra
and
constantly
rising
in
it
he
obtained
the
position
of
director
He
was
rather
a
poor
performer
but
he
understood
music
thoroughly
At
twenty-eight
he
migrated
into
Russia
on
the
invitation
of
a
great
nobleman
who
did
not
care
for
music
himself
but
kept
an
orchestra
for
show
Lemm
lived
with
him
seven
years
in
the
capacity
of
orchestra
conductor
and
left
him
empty-handed
The
nobleman
was
ruined
he
intended
to
give
him
a
promissory
note
but
in
the
sequel
refused
him
even
that
in
short
did
not
pay
him
a
farthing
He
was
advised
to
go
away
but
he
was
unwilling
to
return
home
in
poverty
from
Russia
that
great
Russia
which
is
a
mine
of
gold
for
artists
he
decided
to
remain
and
try
his
luck
For
twenty
years
the
poor
German
had
been
trying
his
luck
he
had
lived
in
various
gentlemen
s
houses
had
suffered
and
put
up
with
much
had
faced
privation
had
struggled
like
a
fish
on
the
ice
but
the
idea
of
returning
to
his
own
country
never
left
him
among
all
the
hardships
he
endured
it
was
this
dream
alone
that
sustained
him
But
fate
did
not
see
fit
to
grant
him
this
last
and
first
happiness
at
fifty
broken-down
in
health
and
prematurely
aged
he
drifted
to
the
town
of
O
and
remained
there
for
good
having
now
lost
once
for
all
every
hope
of
leaving
Russia
which
he
detested
He
gained
his
poor
livelihood
somehow
by
lessons
Lemm
s
exterior
was
not
prepossessing
He
was
short
and
bent
with
crooked
shoulders
and
contracted
chest
with
large
flat
feet
and
bluish
white
nails
on
the
gnarled
bony
fingers
of
his
sinewy
red
hands
He
had
a
wrinkled
face
sunken
cheeks
and
compressed
lips
which
he
was
for
ever
twitching
and
biting
and
this
together
with
his
habitual
taciturnity
produced
an
impression
almost
sinister
His
grey
hair
hung
in
tufts
on
his
low
brow
like
smouldering
embers
his
little
set
eyes
glowed
with
dull
fire
He
moved
painfully
at
every
step
swinging
his
ungainly
body
forward
Some
of
his
movements
recalled
the
clumsy
actions
of
an
owl
in
a
cage
when
it
feels
that
it
is
being
looked
at
but
itself
can
hardly
see
out
of
its
great
yellow
eyes
timorously
and
drowsily
blinking
Pitiless
prolonged
sorrow
had
laid
its
indelible
stamp
on
the
poor
musician
it
had
disfigured
and
deformed
his
person
by
no
means
attractive
to
begin
with
But
any
one
who
was
able
to
get
over
the
first
impression
would
have
discerned
something
good
and
honest
and
out
of
the
common
in
this
half-shattered
creature
A
devoted
admirer
of
Bach
and
Handel
a
master
of
his
art
gifted
with
a
lively
imagination
and
that
boldness
of
conception
which
is
only
vouchsafed
to
the
German
race
Lemm
might
in
time
who
knows
have
taken
rank
with
the
great
composers
of
his
fatherland
had
his
life
been
different
but
he
was
born
under
an
unlucky
star
He
had
written
much
in
his
life
and
it
had
not
been
granted
to
him
to
see
one
of
his
compositions
produced
he
did
not
know
how
to
set
about
things
in
the
right
way
to
gain
favour
in
the
right
place
and
to
make
a
push
at
the
right
moment
A
long
long
time
ago
his
one
friend
and
admirer
also
a
German
and
also
poor
had
published
two
of
Lemm
s
sonatas
at
his
own
expense
the
whole
edition
remained
on
the
shelves
of
the
music-shops
they
disappeared
without
a
trace
as
though
they
had
been
thrown
into
a
river
by
night
At
last
Lemm
had
renounced
everything
the
years
too
did
their
work
his
mind
had
grown
hard
and
stiff
as
his
fingers
had
stiffened
He
lived
alone
in
a
little
cottage
not
far
from
the
Kalitin
s
house
with
an
old
cook
he
had
taken
out
of
the
poorhouse
he
had
never
married
He
took
long
walks
and
read
the
Bible
and
the
Protestant
version
of
the
Psalms
and
Shakespeare
in
Schlegel
s
translation
He
had
composed
nothing
for
a
long
time
but
apparently
Lisa
his
best
pupil
had
been
able
to
inspire
him
he
had
written
for
her
the
cantata
to
which
Panshin
had
made
allusion
The
words
of
this
cantata
he
had
borrowed
from
his
collection
of
hymns
He
had
added
a
few
verses
of
his
own
It
was
sung
by
two
choruses
a
chorus
of
the
happy
and
a
chorus
of
the
unhappy
The
two
were
brought
into
harmony
at
the
end
and
sang
together
Merciful
God
have
pity
on
us
sinners
and
deliver
us
from
all
evil
thoughts
and
earthly
hopes
On
the
title-page
was
the
inscription
most
carefully
written
and
even
illuminated
Only
the
righteous
are
justified
A
religious
cantata
Composed
and
dedicated
to
Miss
Elisaveta
Kalitin
his
dear
pupil
by
her
teacher
C
T
G
Lemm
The
words
Only
the
righteous
are
justified
and
Elisaveta
Kalitin
were
encircled
by
rays
Below
was
written
For
you
alone
fur
Sie
allein
This
was
why
Lemm
had
grown
red
and
looked
reproachfully
at
Lisa
he
was
deeply
wounded
when
Panshin
spoke
of
his
cantata
before
him
Panshin
who
was
playing
bass
struck
the
first
chords
of
the
sonata
loudly
and
decisively
but
Lisa
did
not
begin
her
part
He
stopped
and
looked
at
her
Lisa
s
eyes
were
fixed
directly
on
him
and
expressed
displeasure
There
was
no
smile
on
her
lips
her
whole
face
looked
stern
and
even
mournful
What
s
the
matter
he
asked
Why
did
you
not
keep
your
word
she
said
I
showed
you
Christopher
Fedoritch
s
cantata
on
the
express
condition
that
you
said
nothing
about
it
to
him
I
beg
your
pardon
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
the
words
slipped
out
unawares
You
have
hurt
his
feelings
and
mine
too
Now
he
will
not
trust
even
me
How
could
I
help
it
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
Ever
since
I
was
a
little
boy
I
could
never
see
a
German
without
wanting
to
teaze
him
How
can
you
say
that
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
This
German
is
poor
lonely
and
broken-down
have
you
no
pity
for
him
Can
you
wish
to
teaze
him
Panshin
was
a
little
taken
aback
You
are
right
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
he
declared
It
s
my
everlasting
thoughtlessness
that
s
to
blame
No
don
t
contradict
me
I
know
myself
So
much
harm
has
come
to
me
from
my
want
of
thought
It
s
owing
to
that
failing
that
I
am
thought
to
be
an
egoist
Panshin
paused
With
whatever
subject
he
began
a
conversation
he
generally
ended
by
talking
of
himself
and
the
subject
was
changed
by
him
so
easily
so
smoothly
and
genially
that
it
seemed
unconscious
In
your
own
household
for
instance
he
went
on
your
mother
certainly
wishes
me
well
she
is
so
kind
you
well
I
don
t
know
your
opinion
of
me
but
on
the
other
hand
your
aunt
simply
can
t
bear
me
I
must
have
offended
her
too
by
some
thoughtless
stupid
speech
You
know
I
m
not
a
favourite
of
hers
am
I
No
Lisa
admitted
with
some
reluctance
she
doesn
t
like
you
Panshin
ran
his
fingers
quickly
over
the
keys
and
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
glided
over
his
lips
Well
and
you
he
said
do
you
too
think
me
an
egoist
I
know
you
very
little
replied
Lisa
but
I
don
t
consider
you
an
egoist
on
the
contrary
I
can
t
help
feeling
grateful
to
you
I
know
I
know
what
you
mean
to
say
Panshin
interrupted
and
again
he
ran
his
fingers
over
the
keys
for
the
music
and
the
books
I
bring
you
for
the
wretched
sketches
with
which
I
adorn
your
album
and
so
forth
I
might
do
all
that
and
be
an
egoist
all
the
same
I
venture
to
think
that
you
don
t
find
me
a
bore
and
don
t
think
me
a
bad
fellow
but
still
you
suppose
that
I
what
s
the
saying
would
sacrifice
friend
or
father
for
the
sake
of
a
witticism
You
are
careless
and
forgetful
like
all
men
of
the
world
observed
Lisa
that
is
all
Panshin
frowned
a
little
Come
he
said
don
t
let
us
discuss
me
any
more
let
us
play
our
sonata
There
s
only
one
thing
I
must
beg
of
you
he
added
smoothing
out
the
leaves
of
the
book
on
the
music
stand
think
what
you
like
of
me
call
me
an
egoist
even
so
be
it
but
don
t
call
me
a
man
of
the
world
that
name
s
insufferable
to
me
Anch
io
sono
pittore
I
too
am
an
artist
though
a
poor
one
and
that
I
mean
that
I
m
a
poor
artist
I
shall
show
directly
Let
us
begin
Very
well
let
us
begin
said
Lisa
The
first
adagio
went
fairly
successfully
though
Panshin
made
more
than
one
false
note
His
own
compositions
and
what
he
had
practised
thoroughly
he
played
very
nicely
but
he
played
at
sight
badly
So
the
second
part
of
the
sonata
a
rather
quick
allegro
broke
down
completely
at
the
twentieth
bar
Panshin
who
was
two
bars
behind
gave
in
and
pushed
his
chair
back
with
a
laugh
No
he
cried
I
can
t
play
to-day
it
s
a
good
thing
Lemm
did
not
hear
us
he
would
have
had
a
fit
Lisa
got
up
shut
the
piano
and
turned
round
to
Panshin
What
are
we
going
to
do
she
asked
That
s
just
like
you
that
question
You
can
never
sit
with
your
hands
idle
Well
if
you
like
let
us
sketch
since
it
s
not
quite
dark
Perhaps
the
other
muse
the
muse
of
painting
what
was
her
name
I
have
forgotten
will
be
more
propitious
to
me
Where
s
your
album
I
remember
my
landscape
there
is
not
finished
Lisa
went
into
the
other
room
to
fetch
the
album
and
Panshin
left
alone
drew
a
cambric
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
and
rubbed
his
nails
and
looked
as
it
were
critically
at
his
hands
He
had
beautiful
white
hands
on
the
second
finger
of
his
left
hand
he
wore
a
spiral
gold
ring
Lisa
came
back
Panshin
sat
down
at
the
window
and
opened
the
album
Ah
he
exclaimed
I
see
that
you
have
begun
to
copy
my
landscape
and
capitally
too
Excellent
only
just
here
give
me
a
pencil
the
shadows
are
not
put
in
strongly
enough
Look
And
Panshin
with
a
flourish
added
a
few
long
strokes
He
was
for
ever
drawing
the
same
landscape
in
the
foreground
large
disheveled
trees
a
stretch
of
meadow
in
the
background
and
jagged
mountains
on
the
horizon
Lisa
looked
over
his
shoulders
at
his
work
In
drawing
just
as
in
life
generally
observed
Panshin
holding
his
head
to
right
and
to
left
lightness
and
boldness
are
the
great
things
At
that
instant
Lemm
came
into
the
room
and
with
a
stiff
bow
was
about
to
leave
it
but
Panshin
throwing
aside
album
and
pencils
placed
himself
in
his
way
Where
are
you
doing
dear
Christopher
Fedoritch
Aren
t
you
going
to
stay
and
have
tea
with
us
I
go
home
answered
Lemm
in
a
surly
voice
my
head
aches
Oh
what
nonsense
do
stop
We
ll
have
an
argument
about
Shakespeare
My
head
aches
repeated
the
old
man
We
set
to
work
on
the
sonata
of
Beethoven
without
you
continued
Panshin
taking
hold
of
him
affectionately
and
smiling
brightly
but
we
couldn
t
get
on
at
all
Fancy
I
couldn
t
play
two
notes
together
correctly
You
d
better
have
sung
your
song
again
replied
Lemm
removing
Panshin
s
hands
and
he
walked
away
Lisa
ran
after
him
She
overtook
him
on
the
stairs
Christopher
Fedoritch
I
want
to
tell
you
she
said
to
him
in
German
accompanying
him
over
the
short
green
grass
of
the
yard
to
the
gate
I
did
wrong
forgive
me
Lemm
made
no
answer
I
showed
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
your
cantata
I
felt
sure
he
would
appreciate
it
and
he
did
like
it
very
much
really
Lemm
stopped
It
s
no
matter
he
said
in
Russian
and
then
added
in
his
own
language
but
he
can
not
understand
anything
how
is
it
you
don
t
see
that
He
s
a
dilettante
and
that
s
all
You
are
unjust
to
him
replied
Lisa
he
understands
everything
and
he
can
do
almost
everything
himself
Yes
everything
second-rate
cheap
scamped
work
That
pleases
and
he
pleases
and
he
is
glad
it
is
so
and
so
much
the
better
I
m
not
angry
the
cantata
and
I
we
are
a
pair
of
old
fools
I
m
a
little
ashamed
but
it
s
no
matter
Forgive
me
Christopher
Fedoritch
Lisa
said
again
It
s
no
matter
he
repeated
in
Russian
you
re
a
good
girl
but
here
is
some
one
coming
to
see
you
Goodbye
You
are
a
very
good
girl
And
Lemm
moved
with
hastened
steps
towards
the
gate
through
which
had
entered
some
gentleman
unknown
to
him
in
a
grey
coat
and
a
wide
straw
hat
Bowing
politely
to
him
he
always
saluted
all
new
faces
in
the
town
of
O
from
acquaintances
he
always
turned
aside
in
the
street
that
was
the
rule
he
had
laid
down
for
himself
Lemm
passed
by
and
disappeared
behind
the
fence
The
stranger
looked
after
him
in
amazement
and
after
gazing
attentively
at
Lisa
went
straight
up
to
her
You
don
t
recognise
me
he
said
taking
off
his
hat
but
I
recognise
you
in
spite
of
its
being
seven
years
since
I
saw
you
last
You
were
a
child
then
I
am
Lavretsky
Is
your
mother
at
home
Can
I
see
her
Mamma
will
be
glad
to
see
you
replied
Lisa
she
had
heard
of
your
arrival
Let
me
see
I
think
your
name
is
Elisaveta
said
Lavretsky
as
he
went
up
the
stairs
Yes
I
remember
you
very
well
you
had
even
then
a
face
one
doesn
t
forget
I
used
to
bring
you
sweets
in
those
days
Lisa
blushed
and
thought
what
a
queer
man
Lavretsky
stopped
for
an
instant
in
the
hall
Lisa
went
into
the
drawing-room
where
Panshin
s
voice
and
laugh
could
be
heard
he
had
been
communicating
some
gossip
of
the
town
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
Gedeonovksy
who
by
this
time
had
come
in
from
the
garden
and
he
was
himself
laughing
aloud
at
the
story
he
was
telling
At
the
name
of
Lavretsky
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
all
in
a
flutter
She
turned
pale
and
went
up
to
meet
him
How
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
my
dear
cousin
she
cried
in
a
plaintive
and
almost
tearful
voice
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
How
are
you
cousin
replied
Lavretsky
with
a
friendly
pressure
of
her
out-stretched
hand
how
has
Providence
been
treating
you
Sit
down
sit
down
my
dear
Fedor
Ivanitch
Ah
how
glad
I
am
But
let
me
present
my
daughter
Lisa
to
you
I
have
already
introduced
myself
to
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
interposed
Lavretsky
Monsier
Panshin
Sergei
Petrovitch
Gedeonovsky
Please
sit
down
When
I
look
at
you
I
can
hardly
believe
my
eyes
How
are
you
As
you
see
I
m
flourishing
And
you
too
cousin
no
ill-luck
to
you
have
grown
no
thinner
in
eight
years
To
think
how
long
it
is
since
we
met
observed
Marya
Dmitrievna
dreamily
Where
have
you
come
from
now
Where
did
you
leave
that
is
I
meant
to
say
she
put
in
hastily
I
meant
to
say
are
you
going
to
be
with
us
for
long
I
have
come
now
from
Berlin
replied
Lavretsky
and
to-morrow
I
shall
go
into
the
country
probably
for
a
long
time
You
will
live
at
Lavriky
I
suppose
No
not
at
Lavriky
I
have
a
little
place
twenty
miles
from
here
I
am
going
there
Is
that
the
little
estate
that
came
to
you
from
Glafira
Petrovna
Yes
Really
Fedor
Ivanitch
You
have
such
a
magnificent
house
at
Lavriky
Lavretsky
knitted
his
brows
a
little
Yes
but
there
s
a
small
lodge
in
this
little
property
and
I
need
nothing
more
for
a
time
That
place
is
the
most
convenient
for
me
now
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
again
thrown
into
such
a
state
of
agitation
that
she
became
quite
stiff
and
her
hands
hung
lifeless
by
her
sides
Panshin
came
to
her
support
by
entering
into
conversation
with
Lavretsky
Marya
Dmitrievna
regained
her
composure
she
leaned
back
in
her
arm-chair
and
now
and
then
put
in
a
word
But
she
looked
all
the
while
with
such
sympathy
at
her
guest
sighed
so
significantly
and
shook
her
head
so
dejectedly
that
the
latter
at
last
lost
patience
and
asked
her
rather
sharply
if
she
was
unwell
Thank
God
no
replied
Marya
Dmitrievna
why
do
you
ask
Oh
I
fancied
you
didn
t
seem
to
be
quite
yourself
Marya
Dmitrievna
assumed
a
dignified
and
somewhat
offended
air
If
that
s
how
the
land
lies
she
thought
it
s
absolutely
no
matter
to
me
I
see
my
good
fellow
it
s
all
like
water
on
a
duck
s
back
for
you
any
other
man
would
have
wasted
away
with
grief
but
you
ve
grown
fat
on
it
Marya
Dmitrievna
did
not
mince
matters
in
her
own
mind
she
expressed
herself
with
more
elegance
aloud
Lavretsky
certainly
did
not
look
like
the
victim
of
fate
His
rosy-cheeked
typical
Russian
face
with
its
large
