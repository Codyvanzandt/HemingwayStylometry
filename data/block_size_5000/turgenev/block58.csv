her
fondest
hopes
came
to
nothing
her
husband
considered
that
it
was
much
more
suitable
to
intrust
Fedya
s
education
to
Glafira
Ivan
Petrovitch
s
poor
wife
could
not
bear
this
blow
she
could
not
bear
a
second
separation
in
a
few
days
without
a
murmur
she
quietly
passed
away
All
her
life
she
had
never
been
able
to
oppose
anything
and
she
did
not
struggle
against
her
illness
When
she
could
no
longer
speak
when
the
shadows
of
death
were
already
on
her
face
her
features
expressed
as
of
old
bewildered
resignation
and
constant
uncomplaining
meekness
with
the
same
dumb
submissiveness
she
looked
at
Glafira
and
just
as
Anna
Pavlovna
kissed
her
husband
s
hand
on
her
deathbed
she
kissed
Glafira
s
commending
to
her
to
Glafira
her
only
son
So
ended
the
earthly
existence
of
this
good
and
gentle
creature
torn
God
knows
why
like
an
uprooted
tree
from
its
natural
soil
and
at
once
thrown
down
with
its
roots
in
the
air
she
had
faded
and
passed
away
leaving
no
trace
and
no
one
mourned
for
her
Malanya
Sergyevna
s
maids
pitied
her
and
so
did
even
Piotr
Andreitch
The
old
man
missed
her
silent
presence
Forgive
me
farewell
my
meek
one
he
whispered
as
he
took
leave
of
her
the
last
time
in
church
He
wept
as
he
threw
a
handful
of
earth
in
the
grave
He
did
not
survive
her
long
not
more
than
five
years
In
the
winter
of
the
year
1819
he
died
peacefully
in
Moscow
where
he
had
moved
with
Glafira
and
his
grandson
and
left
instructions
that
he
should
be
buried
beside
Anna
Pavlovna
and
Malasha
Ivan
Petrovitch
was
then
in
Paris
amusing
himself
he
had
retired
from
service
soon
after
1815
When
he
heard
of
his
father
s
death
he
decided
to
return
to
Russia
It
was
necessary
to
make
arrangements
for
the
management
of
the
property
Fedya
according
to
Glafira
s
letter
had
reached
his
twelfth
year
and
the
time
had
come
to
set
about
his
education
in
earnest
Ivan
Petrovitch
returned
to
Russia
an
Anglomaniac
His
short-cropped
hair
his
starched
shirt-front
his
long-skirted
pea-green
overcoat
with
its
multitude
of
capes
the
sour
expression
of
his
face
something
abrupt
and
at
the
same
time
indifferent
in
his
behaviour
his
way
of
speaking
through
his
teeth
his
sudden
wooden
laugh
the
absence
of
smiles
his
exclusively
political
or
politic-economical
conversation
his
passion
for
roast
beef
and
port
wine
everything
about
him
breathed
so
to
speak
of
Great
Britain
But
marvelous
to
relate
while
he
had
been
transformed
into
an
Anglomaniac
Ivan
Petrovitch
had
at
the
same
time
become
a
patriot
at
least
he
called
himself
a
patriot
though
he
knew
Russia
little
had
not
retained
a
single
Russian
habit
and
expressed
himself
in
Russian
rather
queerly
in
ordinary
conversation
his
language
was
spiritless
and
inanimate
and
constantly
interspersed
with
Gallicisms
Ivan
Petrovitch
brought
with
him
a
few
schemes
in
manuscript
relating
to
the
administration
and
reform
of
the
government
he
was
much
displeased
with
everything
he
saw
the
lack
of
system
especially
aroused
his
spleen
On
his
meeting
with
his
sister
at
the
first
word
he
announced
to
her
that
he
was
determined
to
introduce
radical
reforms
that
henceforth
everything
to
do
with
him
would
be
on
a
different
system
Glafira
Petrovna
made
no
reply
to
Ivan
Petrovitch
she
only
ground
her
teeth
and
thought
Where
am
I
to
take
refuge
After
she
was
back
in
the
country
however
with
her
brother
and
nephew
her
fears
were
soon
set
at
rest
In
the
house
certainly
some
changes
were
made
idlers
and
dependants
met
with
summary
dismissal
among
them
two
old
women
were
made
to
suffer
one
blind
another
broken
down
by
paralysis
and
also
a
decrepit
major
of
the
days
of
Catherine
who
on
account
of
his
really
abnormal
appetite
was
fed
on
nothing
but
black
bread
and
lentils
The
order
went
forth
not
to
admit
the
guests
of
former
days
they
were
replaced
by
a
distant
neighbour
a
certain
fair-haired
scrofulous
baron
a
very
well
educated
and
very
stupid
man
New
furniture
was
brought
from
Moscow
spittoons
were
introduced
and
bells
and
washing-stands
and
breakfast
began
to
be
served
in
a
different
way
foreign
wines
replaced
vodka
and
syrups
the
servants
were
put
into
new
livery
a
motto
was
added
to
the
family
arms
in
recto
virtus
In
reality
Glafira
s
power
suffered
no
diminution
the
giving
out
and
buying
of
stores
still
depended
on
her
The
Alsatian
steward
brought
from
abroad
tried
to
fight
it
out
with
her
and
lost
his
place
in
spite
of
the
master
s
protection
As
for
the
management
of
the
house
and
the
administration
of
the
estate
Glafira
Petrovna
had
undertaken
these
duties
also
in
spite
of
Ivan
Petrovitch
s
intention
more
than
once
expressed
to
breathe
new
life
into
this
chaos
everything
remained
as
before
only
the
rent
was
in
some
places
raised
the
mistress
was
more
strict
and
the
peasants
were
forbidden
to
apply
direct
to
Ivan
Petrovitch
The
patriot
had
already
a
great
contempt
for
his
fellow-countrymen
Ivan
Petrovitch
s
system
was
applied
in
its
full
force
only
to
Fedya
his
education
really
underwent
a
radical
reformation
his
father
devoted
himself
exclusively
to
it
Until
Ivan
Petrovitch
s
return
from
abroad
Fedya
was
as
already
related
in
the
hands
of
Glafira
Petrovna
He
was
not
eight
years
old
when
his
mother
died
he
did
not
see
her
every
day
and
loved
her
passionately
the
memory
of
her
of
her
pale
and
gentle
face
of
her
dejected
looks
and
timid
caresses
was
imprinted
on
his
heart
for
ever
but
he
vaguely
understood
her
position
in
the
house
he
felt
that
between
him
and
her
there
existed
a
barrier
which
she
dared
not
and
could
not
break
down
He
was
shy
of
his
father
and
indeed
Ivan
Petrovitch
on
his
side
never
caressed
him
his
grandfather
sometimes
patted
him
on
the
head
and
gave
him
his
hand
to
kiss
but
he
thought
him
and
called
him
a
little
fool
After
the
death
of
Malanya
Sergyevna
his
aunt
finally
got
him
under
her
control
Fedya
was
afraid
of
her
he
was
afraid
of
her
bright
sharp
eyes
and
her
harsh
voice
he
dared
not
utter
a
sound
in
her
presence
often
when
he
only
moved
a
little
in
his
chair
she
would
hiss
out
at
once
What
are
you
doing
sit
still
On
Sundays
after
mass
he
was
allowed
to
play
that
is
to
say
he
was
given
a
thick
book
a
mysterious
book
the
work
of
a
certain
Maimovitch-Ambodik
entitled
Symbols
and
Emblems
This
book
was
a
medley
of
about
a
thousand
mostly
very
enigmatical
pictures
and
as
many
enigmatical
interpretations
of
them
in
five
languages
Cupid
naked
and
very
puffy
in
the
body
played
a
leading
part
in
these
illustrations
In
one
of
them
under
the
heading
Saffron
and
the
Rainbow
the
interpretation
appended
was
Of
this
the
influence
is
vast
opposite
another
entitled
A
heron
flying
with
a
violet
in
his
beak
stood
the
inscription
To
thee
they
are
all
known
Cupid
and
the
bear
licking
his
fur
was
inscribed
Little
by
little
Fedya
used
to
ponder
over
these
pictures
he
knew
them
all
to
the
minutest
details
some
of
them
always
the
same
ones
used
to
set
him
dreaming
and
afforded
him
food
for
meditation
he
knew
no
other
amusements
When
the
time
came
to
teach
him
languages
and
music
Glafira
Petrovna
engaged
for
next
to
nothing
an
old
maid
a
Swede
with
eyes
like
a
hare
s
who
spoke
French
and
German
with
mistakes
in
every
alternate
word
played
after
a
fashion
on
the
piano
and
above
all
salted
cucumbers
to
a
perfection
In
the
society
of
this
governess
his
aunt
and
the
old
servant
maid
Vassilyevna
Fedya
spent
four
whole
years
Often
he
would
sit
in
the
corner
with
his
Emblems
he
sat
there
endlessly
there
was
a
scent
of
geranium
in
the
low
pitched
room
the
solitary
candle
burnt
dim
the
cricket
chirped
monotonously
as
though
it
were
weary
the
little
clock
ticked
away
hurriedly
on
the
wall
a
mouse
scratched
stealthily
and
gnawed
at
the
wall-paper
and
the
three
old
women
like
the
Fates
swiftly
and
silently
plied
their
knitting
needles
the
shadows
raced
after
their
hands
and
quivered
strangely
in
the
half
darkness
and
strange
half
dark
ideas
swarmed
in
the
child
s
brain
No
one
would
have
called
Fedya
an
interesting
child
he
was
rather
pale
but
stout
clumsily
built
and
awkward
a
thorough
peasant
as
Glafira
Petrovna
said
the
pallor
would
soon
have
vanished
from
his
cheeks
if
he
had
been
allowed
oftener
to
be
in
the
open
air
He
learnt
fairly
quickly
though
he
was
often
lazy
he
never
cried
but
at
times
he
was
overtaken
by
a
fit
of
savage
obstinacy
then
no
one
could
soften
him
Fedya
loved
no
one
among
those
around
him
Woe
to
the
heart
that
has
not
loved
in
youth
Thus
Ivan
Petrovitch
found
him
and
without
loss
of
time
he
set
to
work
to
apply
his
system
to
him
I
want
above
all
to
make
a
man
un
homme
of
him
he
said
to
Glafira
Petrovna
and
not
only
a
man
but
a
Spartan
Ivan
Petrovitch
began
carrying
out
his
intentions
by
putting
his
son
in
a
Scotch
kilt
the
twelve-year-old
boy
had
to
go
about
with
bare
knees
and
a
plume
stuck
in
his
Scotch
cap
The
Swedish
lady
was
replaced
by
a
young
Swiss
tutor
who
was
versed
in
gymnastics
to
perfection
Music
as
a
pursuit
unworthy
of
a
man
was
discarded
The
natural
sciences
international
law
mathematics
carpentry
after
Jean-Jacques
Rousseau
s
precept
and
heraldry
to
encourage
chivalrous
feelings
were
what
the
future
man
was
to
be
occupied
with
He
was
waked
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
splashed
at
once
with
cold
water
and
set
to
running
round
a
high
pole
with
a
cord
he
had
only
one
meal
a
day
consisting
of
a
single
dish
rode
on
horseback
shot
with
a
cross-bow
at
every
convenient
opportunity
he
was
exercised
in
acquiring
after
his
parent
s
example
firmness
of
will
and
every
evening
he
inscribed
in
a
special
book
an
account
of
the
day
and
his
impressions
and
Ivan
Petrovitch
on
his
side
wrote
him
instructions
in
French
in
which
he
called
him
mon
fils
and
addressed
him
as
vous
In
Russian
Fedya
called
his
father
thou
but
did
not
dare
to
sit
down
in
his
presence
The
system
dazed
the
boy
confused
and
cramped
his
intellect
but
his
health
on
the
other
hand
was
benefited
by
the
new
manner
of
his
life
at
first
he
fell
into
a
fever
but
soon
recovered
and
began
to
grow
stout
and
strong
His
father
was
proud
of
him
and
called
him
in
his
strange
jargon
a
child
of
nature
my
creation
When
Fedya
had
reached
his
sixteenth
year
Ivan
Petrovitch
thought
it
his
duty
in
good
time
to
instil
into
him
a
contempt
for
the
female
sex
and
the
young
Spartan
with
timidity
in
his
heart
and
the
first
down
on
his
lip
full
of
sap
and
strength
and
young
blood
already
tried
to
seem
indifferent
cold
and
rude
Meanwhile
time
was
passing
Ivan
Petrovitch
spent
the
great
part
of
the
year
in
Lavriky
that
was
the
name
of
the
principal
estate
inherited
from
his
ancestors
But
in
the
winter
he
used
to
go
to
Moscow
alone
there
he
stayed
at
a
tavern
diligently
visited
the
club
made
speeches
and
developed
his
plans
in
drawing-rooms
and
in
his
behaviour
was
more
than
ever
Anglomaniac
grumbling
and
political
But
the
year
1825
came
and
brought
much
sorrow
Intimate
friends
and
acquaintances
of
Ivan
Petrovitch
underwent
painful
experiences
Ivan
Petrovitch
made
haste
to
withdraw
into
the
country
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
house
Another
year
passed
by
and
suddenly
Ivan
Petrovitch
grew
feeble
and
ailing
his
health
began
to
break
up
He
the
free-thinker
began
to
go
to
church
and
have
prayers
put
up
for
him
he
the
European
began
to
sit
in
steam-baths
to
dine
at
two
o
clock
to
go
to
bed
at
nine
and
to
doze
off
to
the
sound
of
the
chatter
of
the
old
steward
he
the
man
of
political
ideas
burnt
all
his
schemes
all
his
correspondence
trembled
before
the
governor
and
was
uneasy
at
the
sigh
of
the
police-captain
he
the
man
of
iron
will
whimpered
and
complained
when
he
had
a
gumboil
or
when
they
gave
him
a
plate
of
cold
soup
Glafira
Petrovna
again
took
control
of
everything
in
the
house
once
more
the
overseers
bailiffs
and
simple
peasants
began
to
come
to
the
back
stairs
to
speak
to
the
old
witch
as
the
servants
called
her
The
change
in
Ivan
Petrovitch
produced
a
powerful
impression
on
his
son
He
had
now
reached
his
nineteenth
year
and
had
begun
to
reflect
and
to
emancipate
himself
from
the
hand
that
pressed
like
a
weight
upon
him
Even
before
this
time
he
had
observed
a
little
discrepancy
between
his
father
s
words
and
deeds
between
his
wide
liberal
theories
and
his
harsh
petty
despotism
but
he
had
not
expected
such
a
complete
breakdown
His
confirmed
egoism
was
patent
now
in
everything
Young
Lavretsky
was
getting
ready
to
go
to
Moscow
to
prepare
for
the
university
when
a
new
unexpected
calamity
overtook
Ivan
Petrovitch
he
became
blind
and
hopelessly
blind
in
one
day
Having
no
confidence
in
the
skill
of
Russian
doctors
he
began
to
make
efforts
to
obtain
permission
to
go
abroad
It
was
refused
Then
he
took
his
son
with
him
and
for
three
whole
years
was
wandering
about
Russia
from
one
doctor
to
another
incessantly
moving
from
one
town
to
another
and
driving
his
physicians
his
son
and
his
servants
to
despair
by
his
cowardice
and
impatience
He
returned
to
Lavriky
a
perfect
wreck
a
tearful
and
capricious
child
Bitter
days
followed
every
one
had
much
to
put
up
with
from
him
Ivan
Petrovitch
was
only
quiet
when
he
was
dining
he
had
never
been
so
greedy
and
eaten
so
much
all
the
rest
of
the
time
he
gave
himself
and
others
no
peace
He
prayed
cursed
his
fate
abused
himself
abused
politics
his
system
abused
everything
he
had
boasted
of
and
prided
himself
upon
everything
he
had
held
up
to
his
son
as
a
model
he
declared
that
he
believed
in
nothing
and
then
began
to
pray
again
he
could
not
put
up
with
one
instant
of
solitude
and
expected
his
household
to
sit
by
his
chair
continually
day
and
night
and
entertain
him
with
stories
which
he
constantly
interrupted
with
exclamations
You
are
for
ever
lying
a
pack
of
nonsense
Glafira
Petrovna
was
specially
necessary
to
him
he
absolutely
could
not
get
on
without
her
and
to
the
end
she
always
carried
out
every
whim
of
the
sick
man
though
sometimes
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
answer
at
once
for
fear
the
sound
of
her
voice
should
betray
her
inward
anger
Thus
he
lingered
on
for
two
years
and
died
on
the
first
day
of
May
when
he
had
been
brought
out
on
to
the
balcony
into
the
sun
Glasha
Glashka
soup
soup
old
foo
his
halting
tongue
muttered
and
before
he
had
articulated
the
last
word
it
was
silent
for
ever
Glafira
Petrovna
who
had
only
just
taken
the
cup
of
soup
from
the
hands
of
the
steward
stopped
looked
at
her
brother
s
face
slowly
made
a
large
sign
of
the
cross
and
turned
away
in
silence
and
his
son
who
happened
to
be
there
also
said
nothing
he
leaned
on
the
railing
of
the
balcony
and
gazed
a
long
while
into
the
garden
all
fragrant
and
green
and
shining
in
the
rays
of
the
golden
sunshine
of
spring
He
was
twenty-three
years
old
how
terribly
how
imperceptibly
quickly
those
twenty-three
years
had
passed
by
Life
was
opening
before
him
After
burying
his
father
and
intrusting
to
the
unchanged
Glafira
Petrovna
the
management
of
his
estate
and
superintendence
of
his
bailiffs
young
Lavretsky
went
to
Moscow
whither
he
felt
drawn
by
a
vague
but
strong
attraction
He
recognised
the
defects
of
his
education
and
formed
the
resolution
as
far
as
possible
to
regain
lost
ground
In
the
last
five
years
he
had
read
much
and
seen
something
he
had
many
stray
ideas
in
his
head
any
professor
might
have
envied
some
of
his
acquirements
but
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
know
much
that
every
schoolboy
would
have
learnt
long
ago
Lavretsky
was
aware
of
his
limitations
he
was
secretly
conscious
of
being
eccentric
The
Anglomaniac
had
done
his
son
an
ill
turn
his
whimsical
education
had
produced
its
fruits
For
long
years
he
had
submitted
unquestioningly
to
his
father
when
at
last
he
began
to
see
through
him
the
evil
was
already
done
his
habits
were
deeply-rooted
He
could
not
get
on
with
people
at
twenty-three
years
old
with
an
unquenchable
thirst
for
love
in
his
shy
heart
he
had
never
yet
dared
to
look
one
woman
in
the
face
With
his
intellect
clear
and
sound
but
somewhat
heavy
with
his
tendencies
to
obstinacy
contemplation
and
indolence
he
ought
from
his
earliest
years
to
have
been
thrown
into
the
stream
of
life
and
he
had
been
kept
instead
in
artificial
seclusion
And
now
the
magic
circle
was
broken
but
he
continued
to
remain
within
it
prisoned
and
pent
up
within
himself
It
was
ridiculous
at
his
age
to
put
on
a
student
s
dress
but
he
was
not
afraid
of
ridicule
his
Spartan
education
had
at
least
the
good
effect
of
developing
in
him
a
contempt
for
the
opinion
of
others
and
he
put
on
without
embarrassment
the
academical
uniform
He
entered
the
section
of
physics
and
mathematics
Robust
rosy-cheeked
bearded
and
taciturn
he
produced
a
strange
impression
on
his
companions
they
did
not
suspect
that
this
austere
man
who
came
so
punctually
to
the
lectures
in
a
wide
village
sledge
with
a
pair
of
horses
was
inwardly
almost
a
child
He
appeared
to
them
to
be
a
queer
kind
of
pedant
they
did
not
care
for
him
and
made
no
overtures
to
him
and
he
avoided
them
During
the
first
two
years
he
spent
in
the
university
he
only
made
acquaintance
with
one
student
from
whom
he
took
lessons
in
Latin
This
student
Mihalevitch
by
name
an
enthusiast
and
a
poet
who
loved
Lavretsky
sincerely
by
chance
became
the
means
of
bringing
about
an
important
change
in
his
destiny
One
day
at
the
theatre
Motchalov
was
then
at
the
height
of
his
fame
and
Lavretsky
did
not
miss
a
single
performance
he
saw
in
a
box
in
the
front
tier
a
young
girl
and
though
no
woman
ever
came
near
his
grim
figure
without
setting
his
heart
beating
it
had
never
beaten
so
violently
before
The
young
girl
sat
motionless
leaning
with
her
elbows
on
the
velvet
of
the
box
the
light
of
youth
and
life
played
in
every
feature
of
her
dark
oval
lovely
face
subtle
intelligence
was
expressed
in
the
splendid
eyes
which
gazed
softly
and
attentively
from
under
her
fine
brows
in
the
swift
smile
on
her
expressive
lips
in
the
very
pose
of
her
head
her
hands
her
neck
She
was
exquisitely
dressed
Beside
her
sat
a
yellow
and
wrinkled
woman
of
forty-five
with
a
low
neck
in
a
black
headdress
with
a
toothless
smile
on
her
intently-preoccupied
and
empty
face
and
in
the
inner
recesses
of
the
box
was
visible
an
elderly
man
in
a
wide
frock-coat
and
high
cravat
with
an
expression
of
dull
dignity
and
a
kind
of
ingratiating
distrustfulness
in
his
little
eyes
with
dyed
moustache
and
whiskers
a
large
meaningless
forehead
and
wrinkled
cheeks
by
every
sign
a
retired
general
Lavretsky
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
girl
who
had
made
such
an
impression
on
him
suddenly
the
door
of
the
box
opened
and
Mihalevitch
went
in
The
appearance
of
this
man
almost
his
one
acquaintance
in
Moscow
in
the
society
of
the
one
girl
who
was
absorbing
his
whole
attention
struck
him
as
curious
and
significant
Continuing
to
gaze
into
the
box
he
observed
that
all
the
persons
in
it
treated
Mihalevitch
as
an
old
friend
The
performance
on
the
stage
ceased
to
interest
Lavretsky
even
Motchalov
though
he
was
that
evening
in
his
best
form
did
not
produce
the
usual
impression
on
him
At
one
very
pathetic
part
Lavretsky
involuntarily
looked
at
his
beauty
she
was
bending
forward
her
cheeks
glowing
under
the
influence
of
his
persistent
gaze
her
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
the
stage
slowly
turned
and
rested
on
him
All
night
he
was
haunted
by
those
eyes
The
skillfully
constructed
barriers
were
broken
down
at
last
he
was
in
a
shiver
and
a
fever
and
the
next
day
he
went
to
Mihalevitch
From
him
he
learnt
that
the
name
of
the
beauty
was
Varvara
Pavlovna
Korobyin
that
the
old
people
sitting
with
her
in
the
box
were
her
father
and
mother
and
that
he
Mihalevitch
had
become
acquainted
with
them
a
year
before
while
he
was
staying
at
Count
N
s
in
the
position
of
a
tutor
near
Moscow
The
enthusiast
spoke
in
rapturous
praise
of
Varvara
Pavlovna
My
dear
fellow
he
exclaimed
with
the
impetuous
ring
in
his
voice
peculiar
to
him
that
girl
is
a
marvelous
creature
a
genius
an
artist
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
and
she
is
very
good
too
Noticing
from
Lavretsky
s
inquiries
the
impression
Varvara
Pavlovna
had
made
on
him
he
himself
proposed
to
introduce
him
to
her
adding
that
he
was
like
one
of
the
family
with
them
that
the
general
was
not
at
all
proud
and
the
mother
was
so
stupid
she
could
not
say
Bo
to
a
goose
Lavretsky
blushed
muttered
something
unintelligible
and
ran
away
For
five
whole
days
he
was
struggling
with
his
timidity
on
the
sixth
day
the
young
Spartan
got
into
a
new
uniform
and
placed
himself
at
Mihalevitch
s
disposal
The
latter
being
his
own
valet
confined
himself
to
combing
his
hair
and
both
betook
themselves
to
the
Korobyins
Varvara
Pavlovna
s
father
Pavel
Petrovitch
Korobyin
a
retired
general-major
had
spent
his
whole
time
on
duty
in
Petersburg
He
had
had
the
reputation
in
his
youth
of
a
good
dancer
and
driller
Through
poverty
he
had
served
as
adjutant
to
two
or
three
generals
of
no
distinction
and
had
married
the
daughter
of
one
of
them
with
a
dowry
of
twenty-five
thousand
roubles
He
mastered
all
the
science
of
military
discipline
and
manoeuvres
to
the
minutest
niceties
he
went
on
in
harness
till
at
last
after
twenty-five
years
service
he
received
the
rank
of
a
general
and
the
command
of
a
regiment
Then
he
might
have
relaxed
his
efforts
and
have
quietly
secured
his
pecuniary
position
Indeed
this
was
what
he
reckoned
upon
doing
but
he
managed
things
a
little
incautiously
He
devised
a
new
method
of
speculating
with
public
funds
the
method
seemed
an
excellent
one
in
itself
but
he
neglected
to
bribe
in
the
right
place
and
was
consequently
informed
against
and
a
more
than
unpleasant
a
disgraceful
scandal
followed
The
general
got
out
of
the
affair
somehow
but
his
career
was
ruined
he
was
advised
to
retire
from
active
duty
For
two
years
he
lingered
on
in
Petersburg
hoping
to
drop
into
some
snug
berth
in
the
civil
service
but
no
such
snug
berth
came
in
his
way
His
daughter
had
left
school
his
expenses
were
increasing
every
day
Resigning
himself
to
his
fate
he
decided
to
remove
to
Moscow
for
the
sake
of
the
greater
cheapness
of
living
and
took
a
tiny
low-pitched
house
in
the
Old
Stables
Road
with
a
coat
of
arms
seven
feet
long
on
the
roof
and
there
began
the
life
of
a
retired
general
at
Moscow
on
an
income
of
2750
roubles
a
year
Moscow
is
a
hospitable
city
ready
to
welcome
all
stray
comers
generals
by
preference
Pavel
Petrovitch
s
heavy
figure
which
was
not
quite
devoid
of
martial
dignity
however
soon
began
to
be
seen
in
the
best
drawing-rooms
in
Moscow
His
bald
head
with
its
tufts
of
dyed
hair
and
the
soiled
ribbon
of
the
Order
of
St
Anne
which
he
wore
over
a
cravat
of
the
colour
of
a
raven
s
wing
began
to
be
familiar
to
all
the
pale
and
listless
young
men
who
hang
morosely
about
the
card-tables
while
dancing
is
going
on
Pavel
Petrovitch
knew
how
to
gain
a
footing
in
society
he
spoke
little
but
from
old
habit
condescendingly
though
of
course
not
when
he
was
talking
to
persons
of
a
higher
rank
than
his
own
He
played
cards
carefully
ate
moderately
at
home
but
consumed
enough
for
six
at
parties
Of
his
wife
there
is
scarcely
anything
to
be
said
Her
name
was
Kalliopa
Karlovna
There
was
always
a
tear
in
her
left
eye
on
the
strength
of
which
Kalliopa
Karlovna
she
was
one
must
add
of
German
extraction
considered
herself
a
woman
of
great
sensibility
She
was
always
in
a
state
of
nervous
agitation
seemed
as
though
she
were
ill-nourished
and
wore
a
tight
velvet
dress
a
cap
and
tarnished
hollow
bracelets
The
only
daughter
of
Pavel
Petrovitch
and
Kalliopa
Karlovna
Varvara
Pavlovna
was
only
just
seventeen
when
she
left
the
boarding-school
in
which
she
had
been
reckoned
if
not
the
prettiest
at
least
the
cleverest
pupil
and
the
best
musician
and
where
she
had
taken
a
decoration
She
was
not
yet
nineteen
when
Lavretsky
saw
her
for
the
first
time
The
young
Spartan
s
legs
shook
under
him
when
Mihalevitch
conducted
him
into
the
rather
shabbily
furnished
drawing-room
of
the
Korobyins
and
presented
him
to
them
But
his
overwhelming
feeling
of
timidity
soon
disappeared
In
the
general
the
good-nature
innate
in
all
Russians
was
intensified
by
that
special
kind
of
geniality
which
is
peculiar
to
all
people
who
have
done
something
disgraceful
the
general
s
lady
was
as
it
were
overlooked
by
every
one
and
as
for
Varvara
Pavlovna
she
was
so
self-possessed
and
easily
cordial
that
every
one
at
once
felt
at
home
in
her
presence
besides
about
all
her
fascinating
person
her
smiling
eyes
her
faultlessly
sloping
shoulders
and
rosy-tinged
white
hands
her
light
and
yet
languid
movements
the
very
sound
of
her
voice
slow
and
sweet
there
was
an
impalpable
subtle
charm
like
a
faint
perfume
voluptuous
tender
soft
though
still
modest
something
which
is
hard
to
translate
into
words
but
which
moved
and
kindled
and
timidity
was
not
the
feeing
it
kindled
Lavretsky
turned
the
conversation
on
the
theater
on
the
performance
of
the
previous
day
she
at
once
began
herself
to
discuss
Motchalov
and
did
not
confine
herself
to
sighs
and
interjections
only
but
uttered
a
few
true
observations
full
of
feminine
insight
in
regard
to
his
acting
Mihalevitch
spoke
about
music
she
sat
down
without
ceremony
to
the
piano
and
very
correctly
played
some
of
Chopin
s
mazurkas
which
were
then
just
coming
into
fashion
Dinner-time
came
Lavretsky
would
have
gone
away
but
they
made
him
stay
at
dinner
the
general
regaled
him
with
excellent
Lafitte
which
the
general
s
lackey
hurried
off
in
a
street-sledge
to
Dupre
s
to
fetch
Late
in
the
evening
Lavretsky
returned
home
for
a
long
while
he
sat
without
undressing
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hands
in
the
stupefaction
of
enchantment
It
seemed
to
him
that
now
for
the
first
time
he
understood
what
made
life
worth
living
all
his
previous
assumptions
all
his
plans
all
that
rubbish
and
nonsense
had
vanished
into
nothing
at
once
all
his
soul
was
absorbed
in
one
feeling
in
one
desire
in
the
desire
of
happiness
of
possession
of
love
the
sweet
love
of
a
woman
From
that
day
he
began
to
go
often
to
the
Korobyins
Six
months
later
he
spoke
to
Varvara
Pavlovna
and
offered
her
his
hand
His
offer
was
accepted
the
general
had
long
before
almost
on
the
eve
of
Lavretsky
s
first
visit
inquired
of
Mihalevitch
how
many
serfs
Lavretsky
owned
and
indeed
Varvara
Pavlovna
who
through
the
whole
time
of
the
young
man
s
courtship
and
even
at
the
very
moment
of
his
declaration
had
preserved
her
customary
composure
and
clearness
of
mind
Varvara
Pavlovna
too
was
very
well
aware
that
her
suitor
was
a
wealthy
man
and
Kalliopa
Karlovna
thought
meine
Tochter
macht
eine
schone
Partie
and
bought
herself
a
new
cap
And
so
his
offer
was
accepted
but
on
certain
conditions
In
the
first
place
Lavretsky
was
at
once
to
leave
the
university
who
would
be
married
to
a
student
and
what
a
strange
idea
too
how
could
a
landowner
a
rich
man
at
twenty-six
take
lessons
and
be
at
school
Secondly
Varvara
Pavlovna
took
upon
herself
the
labour
of
ordering
and
purchasing
her
trousseau
and
even
choosing
her
present
from
the
bridegroom
She
had
much
practical
sense
a
great
deal
of
taste
and
a
very
great
love
of
comfort
together
with
a
great
faculty
for
obtaining
it
for
herself
Lavretsky
was
especially
struck
by
this
faculty
when
immediately
after
their
wedding
he
traveled
alone
with
his
wife
in
the
comfortable
carriage
bought
by
her
to
Lavriky
How
carefully
everything
with
which
he
was
surrounded
had
been
thought
of
devised
and
provided
beforehand
by
Varvara
Pavlovna
What
charming
knick-knacks
appeared
from
various
snug
corners
what
fascinating
toilet-cases
and
coffee-pots
and
how
delightfully
Varvara
Pavlovna
herself
made
the
coffee
in
the
morning
Lavretsky
however
was
not
at
that
time
disposed
to
be
observant
he
was
blissful
drunk
with
happiness
he
gave
himself
up
to
it
like
a
child
Indeed
he
was
as
innocent
as
a
child
this
young
Hercules
Not
in
vain
was
the
whole
personality
of
his
young
wife
breathing
with
fascination
not
in
vain
was
her
promise
to
the
senses
of
a
mysterious
luxury
of
untold
bliss
her
fulfillment
was
richer
than
her
promise
When
she
reached
Lavriky
in
the
very
height
of
the
summer
she
found
the
house
dark
and
dirty
the
servants
absurd
and
