path
he
said
with
an
effort
I
should
not
have
slept
all
night
if
I
had
not
overtaken
you
Give
me
your
hand
Are
you
going
home
Yes
I
will
see
you
home
then
But
why
have
you
come
without
a
cap
on
That
doesn
t
matter
I
took
off
my
neckerchief
too
It
is
quite
warm
The
friends
walked
a
few
paces
I
was
very
stupid
to-day
wasn
t
I
Shubin
asked
suddenly
To
speak
frankly
you
were
I
couldn
t
make
you
out
I
have
never
seen
you
like
that
before
And
what
were
you
angry
about
really
Such
trifles
H
m
muttered
Shubin
That
s
how
you
put
it
but
they
were
not
trifles
to
me
You
see
he
went
on
I
ought
to
point
out
to
you
that
I
that
you
may
think
what
you
please
of
me
I
well
there
I
m
in
love
with
Elena
You
in
love
with
Elena
repeated
Bersenyev
standing
still
Yes
pursued
Shubin
with
affected
carelessness
Does
that
astonish
you
I
will
tell
you
something
else
Till
this
evening
I
still
had
hopes
that
she
might
come
to
love
me
in
time
But
to-day
I
have
seen
for
certain
that
there
is
no
hope
for
me
She
is
in
love
with
some
one
else
Some
one
else
Whom
Whom
You
cried
Shubin
slapping
Bersenyev
on
the
shoulder
Me
You
repeated
Shubin
Bersenyev
stepped
back
a
pace
and
stood
motionless
Shubin
looked
intently
at
him
And
does
that
astonish
you
You
are
a
modest
youth
But
she
loves
you
You
can
make
your
mind
easy
on
that
score
What
nonsense
you
talk
Bersenyev
protested
at
last
with
an
air
of
vexation
No
it
s
not
nonsense
But
why
are
we
standing
still
Let
us
go
on
It
s
easier
to
talk
as
we
walk
I
have
known
her
a
long
while
and
I
know
her
well
I
can
not
be
mistaken
You
are
a
man
after
her
own
heart
There
was
a
time
when
she
found
me
agreeable
but
in
the
first
place
I
am
too
frivolous
a
young
man
for
her
while
you
are
a
serious
person
you
are
a
morally
and
physically
well-regulated
person
you
hush
I
have
not
finished
you
are
a
conscientiously
disposed
enthusiast
a
genuine
type
of
those
devotees
of
science
of
whom
no
not
of
whom
whereof
the
middle
class
of
Russian
gentry
are
so
justly
proud
And
secondly
Elena
caught
me
the
other
day
kissing
Zoya
s
arms
Zoya
s
Yes
Zoya
s
What
would
you
have
She
has
such
fine
shoulders
Shoulders
Well
there
shoulders
and
arms
isn
t
it
all
the
same
Elena
caught
me
in
this
unconstrained
proceeding
after
dinner
and
before
dinner
I
had
been
abusing
Zoya
in
her
hearing
Elena
unfortunately
doesn
t
understand
how
natural
such
contradictions
are
Then
you
came
on
the
scene
you
have
faith
in
what
the
deuce
is
it
you
have
faith
in
You
blush
and
look
confused
you
discuss
Schiller
and
Schelling
she
s
always
on
the
look-out
for
remarkable
men
and
so
you
have
won
the
day
and
I
poor
wretch
try
to
joke
and
all
the
while
Shubin
suddenly
burst
into
tears
turned
away
and
dropping
upon
the
ground
clutched
at
his
hair
Bersenyev
went
up
to
him
Pavel
he
began
what
childishness
this
is
Really
what
s
the
matter
with
you
to-day
God
knows
what
nonsense
you
have
got
into
your
head
and
you
are
crying
Upon
my
word
I
believe
you
must
be
putting
it
on
Shubin
lifted
up
his
head
The
tears
shone
bright
on
his
cheeks
in
the
moonlight
but
there
was
a
smile
on
his
face
Andrei
Petrovitch
he
said
you
may
think
what
you
please
about
me
I
am
even
ready
to
agree
with
you
that
I
m
hysterical
now
but
by
God
I
m
in
love
with
Elena
and
Elena
loves
you
I
promised
though
to
see
you
home
and
I
will
keep
my
promise
He
got
up
What
a
night
silvery
dark
youthful
How
sweet
it
must
be
to-night
for
men
who
are
loved
How
sweet
for
them
not
to
sleep
Will
you
sleep
Andrei
Petrovitch
Bersenyev
made
no
answer
and
quickened
his
pace
Where
are
you
hurrying
to
Shubin
went
on
Trust
my
words
a
night
like
this
will
never
come
again
in
your
life
and
at
home
Schelling
will
keep
It
s
true
he
did
you
good
service
to-day
but
you
need
not
hurry
for
all
that
Sing
if
you
can
sing
sing
louder
than
ever
if
you
can
t
sing
take
off
your
hat
throw
up
your
head
and
smile
to
the
stars
They
are
all
looking
at
you
at
you
alone
the
stars
never
do
anything
but
look
down
upon
lovers
that
s
why
they
are
so
charming
You
are
in
love
I
suppose
Andrei
Petrovitch
You
don
t
answer
me
why
don
t
you
answer
Shubin
began
again
Oh
if
you
feel
happy
be
quiet
be
quiet
I
chatter
because
I
am
a
poor
devil
unloved
I
am
a
jester
an
artist
a
buffoon
but
what
unutterable
ecstasy
would
I
quaff
in
the
night
wind
under
the
stars
if
I
knew
that
I
were
loved
Bersenyev
are
you
happy
Bersenyev
was
silent
as
before
and
walked
quickly
along
the
smooth
path
In
front
between
the
trees
glimmered
the
lights
of
the
little
village
in
which
he
was
staying
it
consisted
of
about
a
dozen
small
villas
for
summer
visitors
At
the
very
beginning
of
the
village
to
the
right
of
the
road
a
little
shop
stood
under
two
spreading
birch-trees
its
windows
were
all
closed
already
but
a
wide
patch
of
light
fell
fan-shaped
from
the
open
door
upon
the
trodden
grass
and
was
cast
upwards
on
the
trees
showing
up
sharply
the
whitish
undersides
of
the
thick
growing
leaves
A
girl
who
looked
like
a
maid-servant
was
standing
in
the
shop
with
her
back
against
the
doorpost
bargaining
with
the
shopkeeper
from
beneath
the
red
kerchief
which
she
had
wrapped
round
her
head
and
held
with
bare
hand
under
her
chin
could
just
be
seen
her
round
cheek
and
slender
throat
The
young
men
stepped
into
the
patch
of
light
Shubin
looked
into
the
shop
stopped
short
and
cried
Annushka
The
girl
turned
round
quickly
They
saw
a
nice-looking
rather
broad
but
fresh
face
with
merry
brown
eyes
and
black
eyebrows
Annushka
repeated
Shubin
The
girl
saw
him
looked
scared
and
shamefaced
and
without
finishing
her
purchases
she
hurried
down
the
steps
slipped
quickly
past
and
hardly
looking
round
went
along
the
road
to
the
left
The
shopkeeper
a
puffy
man
unmoved
by
anything
in
the
world
like
all
country
shopkeepers
gasped
and
gaped
after
her
while
Shubin
turned
to
Bersenyev
with
the
words
That
s
you
see
there
s
a
family
here
I
know
so
at
their
house
you
mustn
t
imagine
and
without
finishing
his
speech
he
ran
after
the
retreating
girl
You
d
better
at
least
wipe
your
tears
away
Bersenyev
shouted
after
him
and
he
could
not
refrain
from
laughing
But
when
he
got
home
his
face
had
not
a
mirthful
expression
he
laughed
no
longer
He
had
not
for
a
single
instant
believed
what
Shubin
had
told
him
but
the
words
he
had
uttered
had
sunk
deep
into
his
soul
Pavel
was
making
a
fool
of
me
he
thought
but
she
will
love
one
day
whom
will
she
love
In
Bersenyev
s
room
there
was
a
piano
small
and
by
no
means
new
but
of
a
soft
and
sweet
tone
though
not
perfectly
in
tune
Bersenyev
sat
down
to
it
and
began
to
strike
some
chords
Like
all
Russians
of
good
birth
he
had
studied
music
in
his
childhood
and
like
almost
all
Russian
gentlemen
he
played
very
badly
but
he
loved
music
passionately
Strictly
speaking
he
did
not
love
the
art
the
forms
in
which
music
is
expressed
symphonies
and
sonatas
even
operas
wearied
him
but
he
loved
the
poetry
of
music
he
loved
those
vague
and
sweet
shapeless
and
all-embracing
emotions
which
are
stirred
in
the
soul
by
the
combinations
and
successions
of
sounds
For
more
than
an
hour
he
did
not
move
from
the
piano
repeating
many
times
the
same
chords
awkwardly
picking
out
new
ones
pausing
and
melting
over
the
minor
sevenths
His
heart
ached
and
his
eyes
more
than
once
filled
with
tears
He
was
not
ashamed
of
them
he
let
them
flow
in
the
darkness
Pavel
was
right
he
thought
I
feel
it
this
evening
will
not
come
again
At
last
he
got
up
lighted
a
candle
put
on
his
dressing-gown
took
down
from
the
bookshelf
the
second
volume
of
Raumer
s
History
of
the
Hohenstaufen
and
sighing
twice
he
set
to
work
diligently
to
read
it
Meanwhile
Elena
had
gone
to
her
room
and
sat
down
at
the
open
window
her
head
resting
on
her
hands
To
spend
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
every
evening
at
her
bedroom
window
had
become
a
habit
with
her
At
this
time
she
held
converse
with
herself
and
passed
in
review
the
preceding
day
She
had
not
long
reached
her
twentieth
year
She
was
tall
and
had
a
pale
and
dark
face
large
grey
eyes
under
arching
brows
covered
with
tiny
freckles
a
perfectly
regular
forehead
and
nose
tightly
compressed
lips
and
a
rather
sharp
chin
Her
hair
of
a
chestnut
shade
fell
low
on
her
slender
neck
In
her
whole
personality
in
the
expression
of
her
face
intent
and
a
little
timorous
in
her
clear
but
changing
glance
in
her
smile
which
was
as
it
were
intense
in
her
soft
and
uneven
voice
there
was
something
nervous
electric
something
impulsive
and
hurried
something
in
fact
which
could
never
be
attractive
to
every
one
which
even
repelled
some
Her
hands
were
slender
and
rosy
with
long
fingers
her
feet
were
slender
she
walked
swiftly
almost
impetuously
her
figure
bent
a
little
forward
She
had
grown
up
very
strangely
first
she
idolised
her
father
then
she
became
passionately
devoted
to
her
mother
and
had
grown
cold
to
both
of
them
especially
to
her
father
Of
late
years
she
had
behaved
to
her
mother
as
to
a
sick
grandmother
while
her
father
who
had
been
proud
of
her
while
she
had
been
regarded
as
an
exceptional
child
had
come
to
be
afraid
of
her
when
she
was
grown
up
and
said
of
her
that
she
was
a
sort
of
enthusiastic
republican
no
one
could
say
where
she
got
it
from
Weakness
revolted
her
stupidity
made
her
angry
and
deceit
she
could
never
never
pardon
She
was
exacting
beyond
all
bounds
even
her
prayers
had
more
than
once
been
mingled
with
reproaches
When
once
a
person
had
lost
her
respect
and
she
passed
judgment
quickly
often
too
quickly
he
ceased
to
exist
for
her
All
impressions
cut
deeply
into
her
heart
life
was
bitter
earnest
for
her
The
governess
to
whom
Anna
Vassilyevna
had
entrusted
the
finishing
of
her
daughter
s
education
an
education
we
may
remark
in
parenthesis
which
had
not
even
been
begun
by
the
languid
lady
was
a
Russian
the
daughter
of
a
ruined
official
educated
at
a
government
boarding
school
a
very
emotional
soft-hearted
and
deceitful
creature
she
was
for
ever
falling
in
love
and
ended
in
her
fiftieth
year
when
Elena
was
seventeen
by
marrying
an
officer
of
some
sort
who
deserted
her
without
loss
of
time
This
governess
was
very
fond
of
literature
and
wrote
verses
herself
she
inspired
Elena
with
a
love
of
reading
but
reading
alone
did
not
satisfy
the
girl
from
childhood
she
thirsted
for
action
for
active
well-doing
the
poor
the
hungry
and
the
sick
absorbed
her
thoughts
tormented
her
and
made
her
heart
heavy
she
used
to
dream
of
them
and
to
ply
all
her
friends
with
questions
about
them
she
gave
alms
carefully
with
unconscious
solemnity
almost
with
a
thrill
of
emotion
All
ill-used
creatures
starved
dogs
cats
condemned
to
death
sparrows
fallen
out
of
the
nest
even
insects
and
reptiles
found
a
champion
and
protector
in
Elena
she
fed
them
herself
and
felt
no
repugnance
for
them
Her
mother
did
not
interfere
with
her
but
her
father
used
to
be
very
indignant
with
his
daughter
for
her
as
he
called
it
vulgar
soft-heartedness
and
declared
there
was
not
room
to
move
for
the
cats
and
dogs
in
the
house
Lenotchka
he
would
shout
to
her
come
quickly
here
s
a
spider
eating
a
fly
come
and
save
the
poor
wretch
And
Lenotchka
all
excitement
would
run
up
set
the
fly
free
and
disentangle
its
legs
Well
now
let
it
bite
you
a
little
since
you
are
so
kind
her
father
would
say
ironically
but
she
did
not
hear
him
At
ten
years
old
Elena
made
friends
with
a
little
beggar-girl
Katya
and
used
to
go
secretly
to
meet
her
in
the
garden
took
her
nice
things
to
eat
and
presented
her
with
handkerchiefs
and
pennies
playthings
Katya
would
not
take
She
would
sit
beside
her
on
the
dry
earth
among
the
bushes
behind
a
thick
growth
of
nettles
with
a
feeling
of
delicious
humility
she
ate
her
stale
bread
and
listened
to
her
stories
Katya
had
an
aunt
an
ill-natured
old
woman
who
often
beat
her
Katya
hated
her
and
was
always
talking
of
how
she
would
run
away
from
her
aunt
and
live
in
God
s
full
freedom
with
secret
respect
and
awe
Elena
drank
in
these
new
unknown
words
stared
intently
at
Katya
and
everything
about
her
her
quick
black
almost
animal
eyes
her
sun-burnt
hands
her
hoarse
voice
even
her
ragged
clothes
seemed
to
Elena
at
such
times
something
particular
and
distinguished
almost
holy
Elena
went
back
home
and
for
long
after
dreamed
of
beggars
and
God
s
freedom
she
would
dream
over
plans
of
how
she
would
cut
herself
a
hazel
stick
and
put
on
a
wallet
and
run
away
with
Katya
how
she
would
wander
about
the
roads
in
a
wreath
of
corn-flowers
she
had
seen
Katya
one
day
in
just
such
a
wreath
If
at
such
times
any
one
of
her
family
came
into
the
room
she
would
shun
them
and
look
shy
One
day
she
ran
out
in
the
rain
to
meet
Katya
and
made
her
frock
muddy
her
father
saw
her
and
called
her
a
slut
and
a
peasant-wench
She
grew
hot
all
over
and
there
was
something
of
terror
and
rapture
in
her
heart
Katya
often
sang
some
half-brutal
soldier
s
song
Elena
learnt
this
song
from
her
Anna
Vassilyevna
overheard
her
singing
it
and
was
very
indignant
Where
did
you
pick
up
such
horrors
she
asked
her
daughter
Elena
only
looked
at
her
mother
and
would
not
say
a
word
she
felt
that
she
would
let
them
tear
her
to
pieces
sooner
than
betray
her
secret
and
again
there
was
a
terror
and
sweetness
in
her
heart
Her
friendship
with
Katya
however
did
not
last
long
the
poor
little
girl
fell
sick
of
fever
and
in
a
few
days
she
was
dead
Elena
was
greatly
distressed
and
spent
sleepless
nights
for
long
after
she
heard
of
Katya
s
death
The
last
words
of
the
little
beggar-girl
were
constantly
ringing
in
her
ears
and
she
fancied
that
she
was
being
called
The
years
passed
and
passed
swiftly
and
noiselessly
like
waters
running
under
the
snow
Elena
s
youth
glided
by
outwardly
uneventful
inwardly
in
conflict
and
emotion
She
had
no
friend
she
did
not
get
on
with
any
one
of
all
the
girls
who
visited
the
Stahovs
house
Her
parents
authority
had
never
weighed
heavily
on
Elena
and
from
her
sixteenth
year
she
became
absolutely
independent
she
began
to
live
a
life
of
her
own
but
it
was
a
life
of
solitude
Her
soul
glowed
and
the
fire
died
away
again
in
solitude
she
struggled
like
a
bird
in
a
cage
and
cage
there
was
none
no
one
oppressed
her
no
one
restrained
her
while
she
was
torn
and
fretted
within
Sometimes
she
did
not
understand
herself
was
even
frightened
of
herself
Everything
that
surrounded
her
seemed
to
her
half-senseless
half-incomprehensible
How
live
without
love
and
there
s
no
one
to
love
she
thought
and
she
felt
terror
again
at
these
thoughts
these
sensations
At
eighteen
she
nearly
died
of
malignant
fever
her
whole
constitution
naturally
healthy
and
vigorous
was
seriously
affected
and
it
was
long
before
it
could
perfectly
recover
the
last
traces
of
the
illness
disappeared
at
last
but
Elena
Nikolaevna
s
father
was
never
tired
of
talking
with
some
spitefulness
of
her
nerves
Sometimes
she
fancied
that
she
wanted
something
which
no
one
wanted
of
which
no
one
in
all
Russia
dreamed
Then
she
would
grow
calmer
and
even
laugh
at
herself
and
pass
day
after
day
unconcernedly
but
suddenly
some
over-mastering
nameless
force
would
surge
up
within
her
and
seem
to
clamour
for
an
outlet
The
storm
passed
over
and
the
wings
of
her
soul
drooped
without
flight
but
these
tempests
of
feeling
cost
her
much
However
she
might
strive
not
to
betray
what
was
passing
within
her
the
suffering
of
the
tormented
spirit
was
expressed
in
her
even
external
tranquillity
and
her
parents
were
often
justified
in
shrugging
their
shoulders
in
astonishment
and
failing
to
understand
her
queer
ways
On
the
day
with
which
our
story
began
Elena
did
not
leave
the
window
till
later
than
usual
She
thought
much
of
Bersenyev
and
of
her
conversation
with
him
She
liked
him
she
believed
in
the
warmth
of
his
feelings
and
the
purity
of
his
aims
He
had
never
before
talked
to
her
as
on
that
evening
She
recalled
the
expression
of
his
timid
eyes
his
smiles
and
she
smiled
herself
and
fell
to
musing
but
not
of
him
She
began
to
look
out
into
the
night
from
the
open
window
For
a
long
time
she
gazed
at
the
dark
low-hanging
sky
then
she
got
up
flung
back
her
hair
from
her
face
with
a
shake
of
her
head
and
herself
not
knowing
why
she
stretched
out
to
it
to
that
sky
her
bare
chilled
arms
then
she
dropped
them
fell
on
her
knees
beside
her
bed
pressed
her
face
into
the
pillow
and
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
not
to
yield
to
the
passion
overwhelming
her
she
burst
into
strange
uncomprehending
burning
tears
The
next
day
at
twelve
o
clock
Bersenyev
set
off
in
a
return
coach
to
Moscow
He
had
to
get
some
money
from
the
post-office
to
buy
some
books
and
he
wanted
to
seize
the
opportunity
to
see
Insarov
and
have
some
conversation
with
him
The
idea
had
occurred
to
Bersenyev
in
the
course
of
his
last
conversation
with
Shubin
to
invite
Insarov
to
stay
with
him
at
his
country
lodgings
But
it
was
some
time
before
he
found
him
out
from
his
former
lodging
he
had
moved
to
another
which
it
was
not
easy
to
discover
it
was
in
the
court
at
the
back
of
a
squalid
stone
house
built
in
the
Petersburg
style
between
Arbaty
Road
and
Povarsky
Street
In
vain
Bersenyev
wandered
from
one
dirty
staircase
to
another
in
vain
he
called
first
to
a
doorkeeper
then
to
a
passer-by
Porters
even
in
Petersburg
try
to
avoid
the
eyes
of
visitors
and
in
Moscow
much
more
so
no
one
answered
Bersenyev
s
call
only
an
inquisitive
tailor
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
a
skein
of
grey
thread
on
his
shoulder
thrust
out
from
a
high
casement
window
a
dirty
dull
unshorn
face
with
a
blackened
eye
and
a
black
and
hornless
goat
clambering
up
on
to
a
dung
heap
turned
round
bleated
plaintively
and
went
on
chewing
the
cud
faster
than
before
A
woman
in
an
old
cloak
and
shoes
trodden
down
at
heel
took
pity
at
last
on
Bersenyev
and
pointed
out
Insarov
s
lodging
to
him
Bersenyev
found
him
at
home
He
had
taken
a
room
with
the
very
tailor
who
had
stared
down
so
indifferently
at
the
perplexity
of
a
wandering
stranger
a
large
almost
empty
room
with
dark
green
walls
three
square
windows
a
tiny
bedstead
in
one
corner
a
little
leather
sofa
in
another
and
a
huge
cage
hung
up
to
the
very
ceiling
in
this
cage
there
had
once
lived
a
nightingale
Insarov
came
to
meet
Bersenyev
directly
he
crossed
the
threshold
but
he
did
not
exclaim
Ah
it
s
you
or
Good
Heavens
what
happy
chance
has
brought
you
He
did
not
even
say
How
do
you
do
but
simply
pressed
his
hand
and
led
him
up
to
the
solitary
chair
in
the
room
Sit
down
he
said
and
he
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
table
I
am
as
you
see
still
in
disorder
added
Insarov
pointing
to
a
pile
of
papers
and
books
on
the
floor
I
haven
t
got
settled
in
as
I
ought
I
have
not
had
time
yet
Insarov
spoke
Russian
perfectly
correctly
pronouncing
every
word
fully
and
purely
but
his
guttural
though
pleasant
voice
sounded
somehow
not
Russian
Insarov
s
foreign
extraction
he
was
a
Bulgarian
by
birth
was
still
more
clearly
marked
in
his
appearance
he
was
a
young
man
of
five-and-twenty
spare
and
sinewy
with
a
hollow
chest
and
knotted
fingers
he
had
sharp
features
a
hooked
nose
blue-black
hair
a
low
forehead
small
intent-looking
deep-set
eyes
and
bushy
eyebrows
when
he
smiled
splendid
white
teeth
gleamed
for
an
instant
between
his
thin
hard
over-defined
lips
He
was
in
a
rather
old
but
tidy
coat
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
Why
did
you
leave
your
old
lodging
Bersenyev
asked
him
This
is
cheaper
and
nearer
to
the
university
But
now
it
s
vacation
And
what
could
induce
you
to
stay
in
the
town
in
summer
You
should
have
taken
a
country
cottage
if
you
were
determined
to
move
Insarov
made
no
reply
to
this
remark
and
offered
Bersenyev
a
pipe
adding
Excuse
me
I
have
no
cigarettes
or
cigars
Bersenyev
began
smoking
the
pipe
Here
have
I
he
went
on
taken
a
little
house
near
Kuntsovo
very
cheap
and
very
roomy
In
fact
there
is
a
room
to
spare
upstairs
Insarov
again
made
no
answer
Bersenyev
drew
at
the
pipe
I
have
even
been
thinking
he
began
again
blowing
out
the
smoke
in
a
thin
cloud
that
if
any
one
could
be
found
you
for
instance
I
thought
of
who
would
care
who
would
consent
to
establish
himself
there
upstairs
how
nice
it
would
be
What
do
you
think
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
Insarov
turned
his
little
eyes
on
him
You
propose
my
staying
in
your
country
house
Yes
I
have
a
room
to
spare
there
upstairs
Thanks
very
much
Andrei
Petrovitch
but
I
expect
my
means
would
not
allow
of
it
How
do
you
mean
My
means
would
not
allow
of
my
living
in
a
country
house
It
s
impossible
for
me
to
keep
two
lodgings
But
of
course
I
Bersenyev
was
beginning
but
he
stopped
short
You
would
have
no
extra
expense
in
that
way
he
went
on
Your
lodging
here
would
remain
for
you
let
us
suppose
but
then
everything
there
is
very
cheap
we
could
even
arrange
so
as
to
dine
for
instance
together
Insarov
said
nothing
Bersenyev
began
to
feel
awkward
You
might
at
least
pay
me
a
visit
sometime
he
began
after
a
short
pause
A
few
steps
from
me
there
s
a
family
living
with
whom
I
want
very
much
to
make
you
acquainted
If
only
you
knew
Insarov
what
a
marvellous
girl
there
is
there
There
is
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
staying
there
too
a
man
of
great
talent
I
am
sure
you
would
get
on
with
him
The
Russian
loves
to
be
hospitable
of
his
friends
if
he
can
offer
nothing
else
Really
you
must
come
And
what
would
be
better
still
come
and
stay
with
me
do
We
could
work
and
read
together
I
am
busy
as
you
know
with
history
and
philosophy
All
that
would
interest
you
I
have
a
lot
of
books
Insarov
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
Let
me
know
he
said
how
much
do
you
pay
for
your
cottage
A
hundred
silver
roubles
And
how
many
rooms
are
there
Five
Then
one
may
reckon
that
one
room
costs
twenty
roubles
Yes
one
may
reckon
so
But
really
it
s
utterly
unnecessary
for
me
It
simply
stands
empty
Perhaps
so
but
listen
added
Insarov
with
a
decided
but
at
the
same
time
good-natured
movement
of
his
head
I
can
only
take
advantage
of
your
offer
if
you
agree
to
take
the
sum
we
have
reckoned
Twenty
roubles
I
am
able
to
give
the
more
easily
since
as
you
say
I
shall
be
economising
there
in
other
things
Of
course
but
really
I
am
ashamed
to
take
it
Otherwise
it
s
impossible
Andrei
Petrovitch
Well
as
you
like
but
what
an
obstinate
fellow
you
are
Insarov
again
made
no
reply
The
young
men
made
arrangements
as
to
the
day
on
which
Insarov
was
to
move
They
called
the
landlord
at
first
he
sent
his
daughter
a
little
girl
of
seven
with
a
large
striped
kerchief
on
her
head
she
listened
attentively
almost
with
awe
to
all
Insarov
said
to
her
and
went
away
without
speaking
after
her
her
mother
a
woman
far
gone
with
child
made
her
appearance
also
wearing
a
kerchief
on
her
head
but
a
very
diminutive
one
Insarov
informed
her
that
he
was
going
to
stay
at
a
cottage
near
Kuntsovo
but
should
keep
on
his
lodging
and
leave
all
his
things
in
their
keeping
the
tailor
s
wife
too
seemed
scared
and
went
away
At
last
the
man
himself
came
in
he
seemed
to
understand
everything
from
the
first
and
only
said
gloomily
Near
Kuntsovo
then
all
at
once
he
opened
the
door
and
shouted
Are
you
going
to
keep
the
lodgings
then
Insarov
reassured
him
Well
one
must
know
repeated
the
tailor
morosely
as
he
disappeared
Bersenyev
returned
home
well
content
with
the
success
of
his
proposal
Insarov
escorted
him
to
the
door
with
cordial
good
manners
not
common
in
Russia
and
when
he
was
left
alone
carefully
took
off
his
coat
and
set
to
work
upon
sorting
his
papers
On
the
evening
of
the
same
day
Anna
Vassilyevna
was
sitting
in
her
drawing-room
and
was
on
the
verge
of
weeping
There
were
also
in
the
room
her
husband
and
a
certain
Uvar
Ivanovitch
Stahov
a
distant
cousin
of
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
a
retired
cornet
of
sixty
years
old
a
man
corpulent
to
the
point
of
immobility
with
sleepy
yellowish
eyes
and
colourless
thick
lips
in
a
puffy
yellow
face
Ever
since
he
had
retired
he
had
lived
in
Moscow
on
the
interest
of
a
small
capital
left
him
by
a
wife
who
came
of
a
shopkeeper
s
family
He
did
nothing
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
thought
of
anything
if
he
did
think
he
kept
his
thoughts
to
himself
Once
only
in
his
life
he
had
been
thrown
into
a
state
of
excitement
and
shown
signs
of
animation
and
that
was
when
he
read
in
the
newspapers
of
a
new
instrument
at
the
Universal
Exhibition
in
London
the
contro-bombardon
and
became
very
anxious
to
order
this
instrument
for
himself
and
even
made
inquiries
as
to
where
to
send
the
money
and
through
what
office
Uvar
Ivanovitch
wore
a
loose
snuff-coloured
coat
and
a
white
neckcloth
used
to
eat
often
and
much
and
in
moments
of
great
perplexity
that
is
to
say
when
it
happened
to
him
to
express
some
opinion
he
would
flourish
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
meditatively
in
the
air
with
a
convulsive
spasm
from
the
first
finger
to
the
little
finger
and
back
from
the
little
finger
to
the
first
finger
while
he
articulated
with
effort
to
be
sure
there
ought
to
in
some
sort
of
a
way
Uvar
Ivanovitch
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
by
the
window
breathing
heavily
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
was
pacing
with
long
strides
up
and
down
the
room
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
his
face
expressed
dissatisfaction
He
stood
still
at
last
and
shook
his
head
Yes
he
began
in
our
day
young
men
were
brought
up
differently
Young
men
did
not
permit
themselves
to
be
lacking
in
respect
to
their
elders
And
nowadays
I
can
only
look
on
and
wonder
Possibly
I
am
all
wrong
and
they
are
quite
right
possibly
But
still
I
have
my
own
views
of
things
I
was
not
born
a
fool
What
do
you
think
about
it
Uvar
Ivanovitch
Uvar
Ivanovitch
could
only
look
at
him
and
work
his
fingers
Elena
Nikolaevna
for
instance
pursued
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
Elena
Nikolaevna
I
don
t
pretend
to
understand
I
am
not
elevated
enough
for
her
Her
heart
is
so
large
that
it
embraces
all
nature
down
to
the
least
spider
or
frog
everything
in
fact
except
her
own
father
Well
that
s
all
very
well
I
know
it
and
I
don
t
trouble
myself
about
it
For
that
s
nerves
and
education
and
lofty
aspirations
and
all
that
is
not
in
my
line
But
Mr
Shubin
admitting
he
s
a
wonderful
artist
quite
exceptional
that
I
don
t
dispute
to
show
want
of
respect
to
his
elder
a
man
to
whom
at
any
rate
one
may
say
he
is
under
great
obligation
that
I
confess
dans
mon
gros
bon
sens
I
can
not
pass
over
I
am
not
exacting
by
nature
no
but
there
is
a
limit
to
everything
Anna
Vassilyevna
rang
the
bell
in
a
tremor
A
little
page
came
in
Why
is
it
Pavel
Yakovlitch
does
not
come
she
said
what
does
it
mean
I
call
him
and
he
doesn
t
come
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
shrugged
his
shoulders
And
what
is
the
object
may
I
ask
of
your
wanting
to
send
for
him
I
don
t
expect
that
at
all
I
don
t
wish
it
even
What
s
the
object
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
He
has
disturbed
you
very
likely
he
has
checked
the
progress
of
your
cure
I
want
to
have
an
explanation
with
him
I
want
to
know
