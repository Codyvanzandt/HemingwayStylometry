embarrassed
and
then
so
be
it
she
thought
Panshin
assumed
a
mysterious
air
and
kept
silent
looking
severely
away
I
fancy
though
it
s
struck
eleven
remarked
Marya
Dmitrievna
Her
guests
took
the
hint
and
began
to
say
good-bye
Varvara
Pavlovna
had
to
promise
that
she
would
come
to
dinner
the
following
day
and
bring
Ada
Gedeonovsky
who
had
all
but
fallen
asleep
sitting
in
his
corner
offered
to
escort
her
home
Panshin
took
leave
solemnly
of
all
but
at
the
steps
as
he
put
Varvara
Pavlovna
into
her
carriage
he
pressed
her
hand
and
cried
after
her
au
revoir
Gedeonovsky
sat
beside
her
all
the
way
home
She
amused
herself
by
pressing
the
tip
of
her
little
foot
as
though
accidentally
on
his
foot
he
was
thrown
into
confusion
and
began
paying
her
compliments
She
tittered
and
made
eyes
at
him
when
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
fell
into
the
carriage
The
waltz
she
had
played
was
ringing
in
her
head
and
exciting
her
whatever
position
she
might
find
herself
in
she
had
only
to
imagine
lights
a
ballroom
rapid
whirling
to
the
strains
of
music
and
her
blood
was
on
fire
her
eyes
glittered
strangely
a
smile
strayed
about
her
lips
and
something
of
bacchanalian
grace
was
visible
over
her
whole
frame
When
she
reached
home
Varvara
Pavlovna
bounded
lightly
out
of
the
carriage
only
real
lionesses
know
how
to
bound
like
that
and
turning
round
to
Gedeonovsky
she
burst
suddenly
into
a
ringing
laugh
right
in
his
face
An
attractive
person
thought
the
counsellor
of
state
as
he
made
his
way
to
his
lodgings
where
his
servant
was
awaiting
him
with
a
glass
of
opodeldoc
It
s
well
I
m
a
steady
fellow
only
what
was
she
laughing
at
Marfa
Timofyevna
spent
the
whole
night
sitting
beside
Lisa
s
bed
Lavretsky
spent
a
day
and
a
half
at
Vassilyevskoe
and
employed
almost
all
the
time
in
wandering
about
the
neighbourhood
He
could
not
stop
long
in
one
place
he
was
devoured
by
anguish
he
was
torn
unceasingly
by
impotent
violent
impulses
He
remembered
the
feeling
which
had
taken
possession
of
him
the
day
after
his
arrival
in
the
country
he
remembered
his
plans
then
and
was
intensely
exasperated
with
himself
What
had
been
able
to
tear
him
away
from
what
he
recognised
as
his
duty
as
the
one
task
set
before
him
in
the
future
The
thirst
for
happiness
again
the
same
thirst
for
happiness
It
seems
Mihalevitch
was
right
he
thought
you
wanted
a
second
time
to
taste
happiness
in
life
he
said
to
himself
you
forgot
that
it
is
a
luxury
an
undeserved
bliss
if
it
even
comes
once
to
a
man
It
was
not
complete
it
was
not
genuine
you
say
but
prove
your
right
to
full
genuine
happiness
Look
round
and
see
who
is
happy
who
enjoys
life
about
you
Look
at
that
peasant
going
to
the
mowing
is
he
contented
with
his
fate
What
would
you
care
to
change
places
with
him
Remember
your
mother
how
infinitely
little
she
asked
of
life
and
what
a
life
fell
to
her
lot
You
were
only
bragging
it
seems
when
you
said
to
Panshin
that
you
had
come
back
to
Russia
to
cultivate
the
soil
you
have
come
back
to
dangle
after
young
girls
in
your
old
age
Directly
the
news
of
your
freedom
came
you
threw
up
everything
forgot
everything
you
ran
like
a
boy
after
a
butterfly
The
image
of
Lisa
continually
presented
itself
in
the
midst
of
his
broodings
He
drove
it
away
with
an
effort
together
with
another
importunate
figure
other
serenely
wily
beautiful
hated
features
Old
Anton
noticed
that
the
master
was
not
himself
after
sighing
several
times
outside
the
door
and
several
times
in
the
doorway
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
up
to
him
and
advised
him
to
take
a
hot
drink
of
something
Lavretsky
swore
at
him
ordered
him
out
afterwards
he
begged
his
pardon
but
that
only
made
Anton
still
more
sorrowful
Lavretsky
could
not
stay
in
the
drawing-room
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
great-grandfather
Andrey
was
looking
contemptuously
from
the
canvas
at
his
feeble
descendant
Bah
you
swim
in
shallow
water
the
distorted
lips
seemed
to
be
saying
Is
it
possible
he
thought
that
I
can
not
master
myself
that
I
am
going
to
give
in
to
this
nonsense
Those
who
are
badly
wounded
in
war
always
call
their
wounds
nonsense
If
man
did
not
deceive
himself
he
could
not
live
on
earth
Am
I
really
a
boy
Ah
well
I
saw
quite
close
I
almost
held
in
my
hands
the
possibility
of
happiness
for
my
whole
life
yes
in
the
lottery
too
turn
the
wheel
a
little
and
the
beggar
perhaps
would
be
a
rich
man
If
it
does
not
happen
then
it
does
not
and
it
s
all
over
I
will
set
to
work
with
my
teeth
clenched
and
make
myself
be
quiet
it
s
as
well
it
s
not
the
first
time
I
have
had
to
hold
myself
in
And
why
have
I
run
away
why
am
I
stopping
here
sticking
my
head
in
a
bush
like
an
ostrich
A
fearful
thing
to
face
trouble
nonsense
Anton
he
called
aloud
order
the
coach
to
be
brought
round
at
once
Yes
he
thought
again
I
must
grin
and
bear
it
I
must
keep
myself
well
in
hand
With
such
reasonings
Lavretsky
tried
to
ease
his
pain
but
it
was
deep
and
intense
and
even
Apraxya
who
had
outlived
all
emotion
as
well
as
intelligence
shook
her
head
and
followed
him
mournfully
with
her
eyes
as
he
took
his
seat
in
the
coach
to
drive
to
the
town
The
horses
galloped
away
he
sat
upright
and
motionless
and
looked
fixedly
at
the
road
before
him
Lisa
had
written
to
Lavretsky
the
day
before
to
tell
him
to
come
in
the
evening
but
he
first
went
home
to
his
lodgings
He
found
neither
his
wife
nor
his
daughter
at
home
from
the
servants
he
learned
that
she
had
gone
with
the
child
to
the
Kalitins
This
information
astounded
and
maddened
him
Varvara
Pavlovna
has
made
up
her
mind
not
to
let
me
live
at
all
it
seems
he
thought
with
a
passion
of
hatred
in
his
heart
He
began
to
walk
up
and
down
and
his
hands
and
feet
were
constantly
knocking
up
against
child
s
toys
books
and
feminine
belongings
he
called
Justine
and
told
her
to
clear
away
all
this
litter
Oui
monsieur
she
said
with
a
grimace
and
began
to
set
the
room
in
order
stooping
gracefully
and
letting
Lavretsky
feel
in
every
movement
that
she
regarded
him
as
an
unpolished
bear
He
looked
with
aversion
at
her
faded
but
still
piquante
ironical
Parisian
face
at
her
white
elbow-sleeves
her
silk
apron
and
little
light
cap
He
sent
her
away
at
last
and
after
long
hesitation
as
Varvara
Pavlovna
still
did
not
return
he
decided
to
go
to
the
Kalitins
not
to
see
Marya
Dmitrievna
he
would
not
for
anything
in
the
world
have
gone
into
that
drawing-room
the
room
where
his
wife
was
but
to
go
up
to
Marfa
Timofyevna
s
He
remembered
that
the
back
staircase
from
the
servants
entrance
led
straight
to
her
apartment
He
acted
on
this
plan
fortune
favoured
him
he
met
Shurotchka
in
the
court-yard
she
conducted
him
up
to
Marfa
Timofyevna
s
He
found
her
contrary
to
her
usual
habit
alone
she
was
sitting
without
a
cap
in
a
corner
bent
and
her
arms
crossed
over
her
breast
The
old
lady
was
much
upset
on
seeing
Lavretsky
she
got
up
quickly
and
began
to
move
to
and
fro
in
the
room
as
if
she
were
looking
for
her
cap
Ah
it
s
you
she
began
fidgeting
about
and
avoiding
meeting
his
eyes
well
how
do
you
do
Well
well
what
s
to
be
done
Where
were
you
yesterday
Well
she
has
come
so
there
there
Well
it
must
one
way
or
another
Lavretsky
dropped
into
a
chair
Well
sit
down
sit
down
the
old
lady
went
on
Did
you
come
straight
up-stairs
Well
there
of
course
So
you
came
to
see
me
Thanks
The
old
lady
was
silent
for
a
little
Lavretsky
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
her
but
she
understood
him
Lisa
yes
Lisa
was
here
just
now
pursued
Marfa
Timofyevna
tying
and
untying
the
tassels
of
her
reticule
She
was
not
quite
well
Shurotchka
where
are
you
Come
here
my
girl
why
can
t
you
sit
still
a
little
My
head
aches
too
It
must
be
the
effect
of
the
singing
and
music
What
singing
auntie
Why
we
have
been
having
those
upon
my
word
what
do
you
call
them
duets
here
And
all
in
Italian
chi-chi
and
cha-cha
like
magpies
for
all
the
world
with
their
long
drawn-out
notes
as
if
they
d
pull
your
very
soul
out
That
s
Panshin
and
your
wife
too
And
how
quickly
everything
was
settled
just
as
though
it
were
all
among
relations
without
ceremony
However
one
may
well
say
even
a
dog
will
try
to
find
a
home
and
won
t
be
lost
so
long
as
folks
don
t
drive
it
out
Still
I
confess
I
did
not
expect
this
rejoined
Lavretsky
there
must
be
great
effrontery
to
do
this
No
my
darling
it
s
not
effrontery
it
s
calculation
God
forgive
her
They
say
you
are
sending
her
off
to
Lavriky
is
it
true
Yes
I
am
giving
up
that
property
to
Varvara
Pavlovna
Has
she
asked
you
for
money
Not
yet
Well
that
won
t
be
long
in
coming
But
I
have
only
now
got
a
look
at
you
Are
you
quite
well
Yes
Shurotchka
cried
Marfa
Timofyevna
suddenly
run
and
tell
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
at
least
no
ask
her
is
she
down-stairs
Yes
Well
then
ask
her
where
she
put
my
book
she
will
know
Very
well
The
old
lady
grew
fidgety
again
and
began
opening
a
drawer
in
the
chest
Lavretsky
sat
still
without
stirring
in
his
place
All
at
once
light
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
and
Lisa
came
in
Lavretsky
stood
up
and
bowed
Lisa
remained
at
the
door
Lisa
Lisa
darling
began
Marfa
Timofyevna
eagerly
where
is
my
book
where
did
you
put
my
book
What
book
auntie
Why
goodness
me
that
book
But
I
didn
t
call
you
though
There
it
doesn
t
matter
What
are
you
doing
down-stairs
Here
Fedor
Ivanitch
has
come
How
is
your
head
It
s
nothing
You
keep
saying
it
s
nothing
What
have
you
going
on
down-stairs
music
No
they
are
playing
cards
Well
she
s
ready
for
anything
Shurotchka
I
see
you
want
a
run
in
the
garden
run
along
Oh
no
Marfa
Timofyevna
Don
t
argue
if
you
please
run
along
Nastasya
Karpovna
has
gone
out
into
the
garden
all
by
herself
you
keep
her
company
You
must
treat
the
old
with
respect
Shurotchka
departed
But
where
is
my
cap
Where
has
it
got
to
Let
me
look
for
it
said
Lisa
Sit
down
sit
down
I
have
still
the
use
of
my
legs
It
must
be
inside
in
my
bedroom
And
flinging
a
sidelong
glance
in
Lavretsky
s
direction
Marfa
Timofyevna
went
out
She
left
the
door
open
but
suddenly
she
came
back
to
it
and
shut
it
Lisa
leant
back
against
her
chair
and
quietly
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
Lavretsky
remained
where
he
was
This
is
how
we
were
to
meet
again
he
brought
out
at
last
Lisa
took
her
hands
from
her
face
Yes
she
said
faintly
we
were
quickly
punished
Punished
said
Lavretsky
What
had
you
done
to
be
punished
Lisa
raised
her
eyes
to
him
There
was
neither
sorrow
or
disquiet
expressed
in
them
they
seemed
smaller
and
dimmer
Her
face
was
pale
and
pale
too
her
slightly
parted
lips
Lavretsky
s
heart
shuddered
for
pity
and
love
You
wrote
to
me
all
is
over
he
whispered
yes
all
is
over
before
it
had
begun
We
must
forget
all
that
Lisa
brought
out
I
am
glad
that
you
have
come
I
wanted
to
write
to
you
but
it
is
better
so
Only
we
must
take
advantage
quickly
of
these
minutes
It
is
left
for
both
of
us
to
do
our
duty
You
Fedor
Ivanitch
must
be
reconciled
with
your
wife
Lisa
I
beg
you
to
do
so
by
that
alone
can
we
expiate
all
that
has
happened
You
will
think
about
it
and
will
not
refuse
me
Lisa
for
God
s
sake
you
are
asking
what
is
impossible
I
am
ready
to
do
everything
you
tell
me
but
to
be
reconciled
to
her
now
I
consent
to
everything
I
have
forgotten
everything
but
I
can
not
force
my
heart
Indeed
this
is
cruel
I
do
not
even
ask
of
you
what
you
say
do
not
live
with
her
if
you
can
not
but
be
reconciled
replied
Lisa
and
again
she
hid
her
eyes
in
her
hand
remember
your
little
girl
do
it
for
my
sake
Very
well
Lavretsky
muttered
between
his
teeth
I
will
do
that
I
suppose
in
that
I
shall
fulfill
my
duty
But
you-what
does
your
duty
consist
in
That
I
know
myself
Lavretsky
started
suddenly
You
can
not
be
making
up
your
mind
to
marry
Panshin
he
said
Lisa
gave
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
Oh
no
she
said
Ah
Lisa
Lisa
cried
Lavretsky
how
happy
you
might
have
been
Lisa
looked
at
him
again
Now
you
see
yourself
Fedor
Ivanitch
that
happiness
does
not
depend
on
us
but
on
God
Yes
because
you
The
door
from
the
adjoining
room
opened
quickly
and
Marfa
Timofyevna
came
in
with
her
cap
in
her
hand
I
have
found
it
at
last
she
said
standing
between
Lavretsky
and
Lisa
I
had
laid
it
down
myself
That
s
what
age
does
for
one
alack
though
youth
s
not
much
better
Well
and
are
you
going
to
Lavriky
yourself
with
your
wife
she
added
turning
to
Lavretsky
To
Lavriky
with
her
I
don
t
know
he
said
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
You
are
not
going
down-stairs
To-day
no
I
m
not
Well
well
you
know
best
but
you
Lisa
I
think
ought
to
go
down
Ah
merciful
powers
I
have
forgotten
to
feed
my
bullfinch
There
stop
a
minute
I
ll
soon
And
Marfa
Timofyevna
ran
off
without
putting
on
her
cap
Lavretsky
walked
quickly
up
to
Lisa
Lisa
he
began
in
a
voice
of
entreaty
we
are
parting
for
ever
my
heart
is
torn
give
me
your
hand
at
parting
Lisa
raised
her
head
her
wearied
eyes
their
light
almost
extinct
rested
upon
him
No
she
uttered
and
she
drew
back
the
hand
she
was
holding
out
No
Lavretsky
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
used
this
name
I
will
not
give
you
my
hand
What
is
the
good
Go
away
I
beseech
you
You
know
I
love
you
yes
I
love
you
she
added
with
an
effort
but
no
no
She
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
Give
me
at
least
that
handkerchief
The
door
creaked
the
handkerchief
slid
on
to
Lisa
s
lap
Lavretsky
snatched
it
before
it
had
time
to
fall
to
the
floor
thrust
it
quickly
into
a
side
pocket
and
turning
round
met
Marfa
Timofyevna
s
eyes
Lisa
darling
I
fancy
your
mother
is
calling
you
the
old
lady
declared
Lisa
at
once
got
up
and
went
away
Marfa
Timofyevna
sat
down
again
in
her
corner
Lavretsky
began
to
take
leave
of
her
Fedor
she
said
suddenly
What
is
it
Are
you
an
honest
man
What
I
ask
you
are
you
an
honest
man
I
hope
so
H
m
But
give
me
your
word
of
honour
that
you
will
be
an
honest
man
Certainly
But
why
I
know
why
And
you
too
my
dear
friend
if
you
think
well
you
re
no
fool
will
understand
why
I
ask
it
of
you
And
now
good-bye
my
dear
Thanks
for
your
visit
and
remember
you
have
given
your
word
Fedya
and
kiss
me
Oh
my
dear
it
s
hard
for
you
I
know
but
there
it
s
not
easy
for
any
one
Once
I
used
to
envy
the
flies
I
thought
it
s
for
them
it
s
good
to
be
alive
but
one
night
I
heard
a
fly
complaining
in
a
spider
s
web
no
I
think
they
too
have
their
troubles
There
s
no
help
Fedya
but
remember
your
promise
all
the
same
Good-bye
Lavretsky
went
down
the
back
staircase
and
had
reached
the
gates
when
a
man-servant
overtook
him
Marya
Dmitrievna
told
me
to
ask
you
to
go
in
to
her
he
commenced
to
Lavretsky
Tell
her
my
boy
that
just
now
I
can
t
Fedor
Ivanitch
was
beginning
Her
excellency
told
me
to
ask
you
very
particularly
continued
the
servant
She
gave
orders
to
say
she
was
at
home
Have
the
visitors
gone
asked
Lavretsky
Certainly
sir
replied
the
servant
with
a
grin
Lavretsky
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
followed
him
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
sitting
alone
in
her
boudoir
in
an
easy-chair
sniffing
eau
de
cologne
a
glass
of
orange-flower-water
was
standing
on
a
little
table
near
her
She
was
agitated
and
seemed
nervous
Lavretsky
came
in
You
wanted
to
see
me
he
said
bowing
coldly
Yes
replied
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
she
sipped
a
little
water
I
heard
that
you
had
gone
straight
up
to
my
aunt
I
gave
orders
that
you
should
be
asked
to
come
in
I
wanted
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
Sit
down
please
Marya
Dmitrievna
took
breath
You
know
she
went
on
your
wife
has
come
I
was
aware
of
that
remarked
Lavretsky
Well
then
that
is
I
wanted
to
say
she
came
to
me
and
I
received
her
that
is
what
I
wanted
to
explain
to
you
Fedor
Ivanitch
Thank
God
I
have
I
may
say
gained
universal
respect
and
for
no
consideration
in
the
world
would
I
do
anything
improper
Though
I
foresaw
that
it
would
be
disagreeable
to
you
still
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
deny
myself
to
her
Fedor
Ivanitch
she
is
a
relation
of
mine
through
you
put
yourself
in
my
position
what
right
had
I
to
shut
my
doors
on
her
you
will
agree
with
me
You
are
exciting
yourself
needlessly
Mary
Dmitrievna
replied
Lavretsky
you
acted
very
well
I
am
not
angry
I
have
not
the
least
intention
of
depriving
Varvara
Pavlovna
of
the
opportunity
of
seeing
her
friends
I
did
not
come
in
to
you
to-day
simply
because
I
did
not
care
to
meet
her
that
was
all
Ah
how
glad
I
am
to
hear
you
say
that
Fedor
Ivanitch
cried
Marya
Dmitrievna
but
I
always
expected
it
of
your
noble
sentiments
And
as
for
my
being
excited
that
s
not
to
be
wondered
at
I
am
a
woman
and
a
mother
And
your
wife
of
course
I
can
not
judge
between
you
and
her
as
I
said
to
her
herself
but
she
is
such
a
delightful
woman
that
she
can
produce
nothing
but
a
pleasant
impression
Lavretsky
gave
a
laugh
and
played
with
his
hat
And
this
is
what
I
wanted
to
say
to
you
besides
Fedor
Ivanitch
continued
Marya
Dmitrievna
moving
slightly
nearer
up
to
him
if
you
had
seen
the
modesty
of
her
behaviour
how
respectful
she
is
Really
it
is
quite
touching
And
if
you
had
heard
how
she
spoke
of
you
I
have
been
to
blame
towards
him
she
said
altogether
I
did
not
know
how
to
appreciate
him
she
said
he
is
an
angel
she
said
and
not
a
man
Really
that
is
what
she
said
an
angel
Her
penitence
is
such
Ah
upon
my
word
I
have
never
seen
such
penitence
Well
Marya
Dmitrievna
observed
Lavretsky
if
I
may
be
inquisitive
I
am
told
that
Varvara
Pavlovna
has
been
singing
in
your
drawing-room
did
she
sing
during
the
time
of
her
penitence
or
how
was
it
Ah
I
wonder
you
are
not
ashamed
to
talk
like
that
She
sang
and
played
the
piano
only
to
do
me
a
kindness
because
I
positively
entreated
almost
commanded
her
to
do
so
I
saw
that
she
was
sad
so
sad
I
thought
how
to
distract
her
mind
and
I
heard
that
she
had
such
marvellous
talent
I
assure
you
Fedor
Ivanitch
she
is
utterly
crushed
ask
Sergei
Petrovitch
even
a
heart-broken
woman
tout
a
fait
what
do
you
say
Lavretsky
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
And
then
what
a
little
angel
is
that
Adotchka
of
yours
what
a
darling
How
sweet
she
is
what
a
clever
little
thing
how
she
speaks
French
and
understand
Russian
too
she
called
me
auntie
in
Russian
And
you
know
that
as
for
shyness
almost
all
children
at
her
age
are
shy
there
s
not
a
trace
of
it
She
s
so
like
you
Fedor
Ivanitch
it
s
amazing
The
eyes
the
forehead
well
it
s
you
over
again
precisely
you
I
am
not
particularly
fond
of
little
children
I
must
own
but
I
simply
lost
my
heart
to
your
little
girl
Marya
Dmitrievna
Lavretsky
blurted
out
suddenly
allow
me
to
ask
you
what
is
your
object
in
talking
to
me
like
this
What
object
Marya
Dmitrievna
sniffed
her
eau
de
cologne
again
and
took
a
sip
of
water
Why
I
am
speaking
to
you
Fedor
Ivanitch
because
I
am
a
relation
of
yours
you
know
I
take
the
warmest
interest
in
you
I
know
your
heart
is
of
the
best
Listen
to
me
mon
cousin
I
am
at
any
rate
a
woman
of
experience
and
I
shall
not
talk
at
random
forgive
her
forgive
your
wife
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
eyes
suddenly
filled
with
tears
Only
think
her
youth
her
inexperience
and
who
knows
perhaps
bad
example
she
had
not
a
mother
who
could
bring
her
up
in
the
right
way
Forgive
her
Fedor
Ivanitch
she
has
been
punished
enough
The
tears
were
trickling
down
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
cheeks
she
did
not
wipe
them
away
she
was
fond
of
weeping
Lavretsky
sat
as
if
on
thorns
Good
God
he
thought
what
torture
what
a
day
I
have
had
to-day
You
make
no
reply
Marya
Dmitrievna
began
again
How
am
I
to
understand
you
Can
you
really
be
so
cruel
No
I
will
not
believe
it
I
feel
that
my
words
have
influenced
you
Fedor
Ivanitch
God
reward
you
for
your
goodness
and
now
receive
your
wife
from
my
hands
Involuntarily
Lavretsky
jumped
up
from
his
chair
Marya
Dmitrievna
also
rose
and
running
quickly
behind
a
screen
she
led
forth
Varvara
Pavlovna
Pale
almost
lifeless
with
downcast
eyes
she
seemed
to
have
renounced
all
thought
all
will
of
her
own
and
to
have
surrendered
herself
completely
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
Lavretsky
stepped
back
a
pace
You
have
been
here
all
the
time
he
cried
Do
not
blame
her
explained
Marya
Dmitrievna
she
was
most
unwilling
to
stay
but
I
forced
her
to
remain
I
put
her
behind
the
screen
She
assured
me
that
this
would
only
anger
you
more
I
would
not
even
listen
to
her
I
know
you
better
than
she
does
Take
your
wife
back
from
my
hands
come
Varya
do
not
fear
fall
at
your
husband
s
feet
she
gave
a
pull
at
her
arm
and
my
blessing
Stop
a
minute
Marya
Dmitrievna
said
Lavretsky
in
a
low
but
startlingly
impressive
voice
I
dare
say
you
are
fond
of
affecting
scenes
Lavretsky
was
right
Marya
Dmitrievna
still
retained
her
school-girl
s
passion
for
a
little
melodramatic
effect
they
amuse
you
but
they
may
be
anything
but
pleasant
for
other
people
But
I
am
not
going
to
talk
to
you
in
this
scene
you
are
not
the
principal
character
What
do
you
want
to
get
out
of
me
madam
he
added
turning
to
his
wife
Haven
t
I
done
all
I
could
for
you
Don
t
tell
me
you
did
not
contrive
this
interview
I
shall
not
believe
you
and
you
know
that
I
can
not
possibly
believe
you
What
is
it
you
want
You
are
clever
you
do
nothing
without
an
object
You
must
realise
that
as
for
living
with
as
I
once
lived
with
you
that
I
can
not
do
not
because
I
am
angry
with
you
but
because
I
have
become
a
different
man
I
told
you
so
the
day
after
your
return
and
you
yourself
at
that
moment
agreed
with
me
in
your
heart
But
you
want
to
reinstate
yourself
in
public
opinion
it
is
not
enough
for
you
to
live
in
my
house
you
want
to
live
with
me
under
the
same
roof
isn
t
that
it
I
want
your
forgiveness
pronounced
Varvara
Pavlovna
not
raising
her
eyes
She
wants
your
forgiveness
repeated
Marya
Dmitrievna
And
not
for
my
own
sake
but
for
Ada
s
murmured
Varvara
Pavlovna
And
not
for
her
own
sake
but
for
your
Ada
s
repeated
Marya
Dmitrievna
Very
good
Is
that
what
you
want
Lavretsky
uttered
with
an
effort
Certainly
I
consent
to
that
too
Varvara
Pavlovna
darted
a
swift
glance
at
him
but
Marya
Dmitrievna
cried
There
God
be
thanked
and
again
drew
Varvara
Pavlvona
forward
by
the
arm
Take
her
now
from
my
arms
Stop
a
minute
I
tell
you
Lavretsky
interrupted
her
I
agree
to
live
with
you
Varvara
Pavlovna
he
continued
that
is
to
say
I
will
conduct
you
to
Lavriky
and
I
will
live
there
with
you
as
long
as
I
can
endure
it
and
then
I
will
go
away
and
will
come
back
again
You
see
I
do
not
want
to
deceive
you
but
do
not
demand
anything
more
You
would
laugh
yourself
if
I
were
to
carry
out
the
desire
of
our
respected
cousin
were
to
press
you
to
my
breast
and
to
fall
to
assuring
you
that
that
the
past
had
not
been
and
the
felled
tree
can
bud
again
But
I
see
I
must
submit
You
will
not
understand
these
words
but
that
s
no
matter
I
repeat
I
will
live
with
you
or
no
I
can
not
promise
that
I
will
be
reconciled
with
you
I
will
regard
you
as
my
wife
again
Give
her
at
least
your
hand
on
it
observed
Marya
Dmitrievna
whose
tears
had
long
since
dried
up
I
have
never
deceived
Varvara
Pavlovna
hitherto
returned
Lavretsky
she
will
believe
me
without
that
I
will
take
her
to
Lavriky
and
remember
Varvara
Pavlovna
our
treaty
is
to
be
reckoned
as
broken
directly
you
go
away
from
Lavriky
And
now
allow
me
to
take
leave
He
bowed
to
both
the
ladies
and
hurriedly
went
away
Are
you
not
going
to
take
her
with
you
Marya
Dmitrievna
cried
after
him
Leave
him
alone
Varvara
Pavlovna
whispered
to
her
And
at
once
she
embraced
her
and
began
thanking
her
kissing
her
hands
and
calling
her
saviour
Marya
Dmitrievna
received
her
caresses
indulgently
but
at
heart
she
was
discontented
with
Lavretsky
with
Varvara
Pavlovna
and
with
the
whole
scene
she
had
prepared
Very
little
sentimentality
had
come
of
it
Varvara
Pavlovna
in
her
opinion
ought
to
have
flung
herself
at
her
husband
s
feet
How
was
it
you
didn
t
understand
me
she
commented
I
kept
saying
down
It
is
better
as
it
was
dear
auntie
do
not
be
uneasy
it
was
all
for
the
best
Varvara
Pavlovna
assured
her
Well
any
way
he
s
as
cold
as
ice
observed
Marya
Dmitrievna
You
didn
t
weep
it
is
true
but
I
was
in
floods
of
tears
before
his
eyes
He
wants
to
shut
you
up
at
Lavriky
Why
won
t
you
even
be
able
to
come
and
see
me
All
men
are
unfeeling
she
concluded
with
a
significant
shake
of
the
head
But
then
women
can
appreciate
goodness
and
noble-heartedness
said
Varvara
Pavlovna
and
gently
dropping
on
her
knees
before
Marya
Dmitrievna
she
flung
her
arms
about
her
round
person
and
pressed
her
face
against
it
That
face
wore
a
sly
smile
but
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
tears
began
to
flow
again
When
Lavretsky
returned
home
he
locked
himself
in
his
valet
s
room
and
flung
himself
on
a
sofa
he
lay
like
that
till
morning
The
following
day
was
Sunday
The
sound
of
bells
ringing
for
early
mass
did
not
wake
Lavretsky
he
had
not
closed
his
eyes
all
night
but
it
reminded
him
of
another
Sunday
when
at
Lisa
s
desire
he
had
gone
to
church
He
got
up
hastily
some
secret
voice
told
him
that
he
would
see
her
there
to-day
He
went
noiselessly
out
of
the
house
leaving
a
message
for
Varvara
Pavlovna
that
he
would
be
back
to
dinner
and
with
long
strides
he
made
his
way
in
the
direction
in
which
the
monotonously
mournful
bells
were
calling
him
He
arrived
early
there
was
scarcely
any
one
in
the
church
a
deacon
was
reading
the
service
in
the
chair
the
measured
drone
of
his
voice
sometimes
broken
by
a
cough
fell
and
rose
at
even
intervals
Lavretsky
placed
himself
not
far
from
the
entrance
Worshippers
came
in
one
by
one
stopped
crossed
themselves
and
bowed
in
all
directions
their
steps
rang
out
in
the
empty
silent
church
echoing
back
distinctly
under
the
arched
roof
An
infirm
poor
little
old
woman
in
a
worn-out
cloak
with
a
hood
was
on
her
knees
near
Lavretsky
praying
assiduously
her
toothless
yellow
wrinkled
face
expressed
intense
emotion
her
red
eyes
were
gazing
fixedly
upwards
at
the
holy
figures
on
the
iconostasis
her
bony
hand
was
constantly
coming
out
from
under
her
cloak
and
slowly
and
earnestly
making
a
great
sign
of
the
cross
A
peasant
with
a
bushy
beard
and
a
surly
face
dishevelled
and
unkempt
came
into
the
church
and
at
once
fell
on
both
knees
and
began
directly
crossing
himself
in
haste
bending
back
his
head
with
a
shake
after
each
prostration
Such
bitter
grief
was
expressed
in
his
face
and
in
all
his
actions
that
Lavretsky
made
up
his
mind
to
go
up
to
him
and
ask
him
what
was
wrong
The
peasant
timidly
and
morosely
started
back
looked
at
him
My
son
