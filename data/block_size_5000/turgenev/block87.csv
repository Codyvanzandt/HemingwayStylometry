broken
she
observed
one
must
be
broken
in
thoroughly
or
let
it
alone
Very
few
people
visited
Madame
Eltsov
but
I
went
often
to
see
her
I
was
secretly
aware
that
she
looked
on
me
with
favour
and
I
liked
Vera
Nikolaevna
very
much
indeed
We
used
to
talk
and
walk
together
Her
mother
was
no
check
upon
us
the
daughter
did
not
like
to
be
away
from
her
mother
and
I
for
my
part
felt
no
craving
for
solitary
talks
with
her
Vera
Nikolaevna
had
a
strange
habit
of
thinking
aloud
she
used
at
night
in
her
sleep
to
talk
loudly
and
distinctly
about
what
had
impressed
her
during
the
day
One
day
looking
at
me
attentively
leaning
softly
as
her
way
was
on
her
hand
she
said
It
seems
to
me
that
B
is
a
good
person
but
there
s
no
relying
on
him
The
relations
existing
between
us
were
of
the
friendliest
and
most
tranquil
only
once
I
fancied
I
detected
somewhere
far
off
in
the
very
depths
of
her
clear
eyes
something
strange
a
sort
of
softness
and
tenderness
But
perhaps
I
was
mistaken
Meanwhile
the
time
was
slipping
by
and
it
was
already
time
for
me
to
prepare
for
departure
But
still
I
put
it
off
At
times
when
I
thought
when
I
realised
that
soon
I
should
see
no
more
of
this
sweet
girl
I
had
grown
so
fond
of
I
felt
sick
at
heart
Berlin
began
to
lose
its
attractive
force
I
had
not
the
courage
to
acknowledge
to
myself
what
was
going
on
within
me
and
indeed
I
didn
t
understand
what
was
taking
place
it
was
as
though
a
cloud
were
overhanging
my
soul
At
last
one
morning
everything
suddenly
became
clear
to
me
Why
seek
further
what
is
there
to
strive
towards
Why
I
shall
not
attain
to
truth
in
any
case
Isn
t
it
better
to
stay
here
to
be
married
And
imagine
the
idea
of
marriage
had
no
terrors
for
me
in
those
days
On
the
contrary
I
rejoiced
in
it
More
than
that
that
day
I
declared
my
intentions
only
not
to
Vera
Nikolaevna
as
one
would
naturally
suppose
but
to
Madame
Eltsov
The
old
lady
looked
at
me
No
she
said
my
dear
boy
go
to
Berlin
get
broken
in
thoroughly
You
re
a
good
fellow
but
it
s
not
a
husband
like
you
that
s
needed
for
Vera
I
hung
my
head
blushed
and
what
will
very
likely
surprise
you
still
more
inwardly
agreed
with
Madame
Eltsov
on
the
spot
A
week
later
I
went
away
and
since
then
I
have
not
seen
her
nor
Vera
Nikolaevna
I
have
related
this
episode
briefly
because
I
know
you
don
t
care
for
anything
meandering
When
I
got
to
Berlin
I
very
quickly
forgot
Vera
Nikolaevna
But
I
will
own
that
hearing
of
her
so
unexpectedly
has
excited
me
I
am
impressed
by
the
idea
that
she
is
so
close
that
she
is
my
neighbour
that
I
shall
see
her
in
a
day
or
two
The
past
seems
suddenly
to
have
sprung
up
out
of
the
earth
before
my
eyes
and
to
have
rushed
down
upon
me
Priemkov
informed
me
that
he
was
coming
to
call
upon
me
with
the
very
object
of
renewing
our
old
acquaintance
and
that
he
should
look
forward
to
seeing
me
at
his
house
as
soon
as
I
could
possibly
come
He
told
me
he
had
been
in
the
cavalry
had
retired
with
the
rank
of
lieutenant
had
bought
an
estate
about
six
miles
from
me
and
was
intending
to
devote
himself
to
its
management
that
he
had
had
three
children
but
that
two
had
died
and
he
had
only
a
little
girl
of
five
surviving
And
does
your
wife
remember
me
I
inquired
Yes
she
remembers
you
he
replied
with
some
slight
hesitation
Of
course
she
was
a
child
one
may
say
in
those
days
but
her
mother
always
spoke
very
highly
of
you
and
you
know
how
precious
every
word
of
her
poor
mother
s
is
to
her
I
recalled
Madame
Eltsov
s
words
that
I
was
not
suitable
for
her
Vera
I
suppose
you
were
suitable
I
thought
with
a
sidelong
look
at
Priemkov
He
spent
some
hours
with
me
He
is
a
very
nice
dear
good
fellow
speaks
so
modestly
and
looks
at
me
so
good-naturedly
One
can
t
help
liking
him
but
his
intellectual
powers
have
not
developed
since
we
used
to
know
him
I
shall
certainly
go
and
see
him
possibly
to-morrow
I
am
exceedingly
curious
to
see
how
Vera
Nikolaevna
has
turned
out
You
spiteful
fellow
are
most
likely
laughing
at
me
as
you
read
this
sitting
at
your
directors
table
But
I
shall
write
and
tell
you
all
the
same
the
impression
she
makes
on
me
Good-bye
till
my
next
Yours

THIRD
LETTER
From
the
SAME
to
the
SAME
M
VILLAGE
June
16
1850
Well
my
dear
boy
I
have
been
to
her
house
I
have
seen
her
First
of
all
I
must
tell
you
one
astonishing
fact
you
may
believe
me
or
not
as
you
like
but
she
has
scarcely
changed
at
all
either
in
face
or
in
figure
When
she
came
to
meet
me
I
almost
cried
out
in
amazement
it
was
simply
a
little
girl
of
seventeen
Only
her
eyes
are
not
a
little
girl
s
but
then
her
eyes
were
never
like
a
child
s
even
in
her
young
days
they
were
too
clear
But
the
same
composure
the
same
serenity
the
same
voice
not
one
line
on
her
brow
as
though
she
had
been
laid
in
the
snow
all
these
years
And
she
s
twenty-eight
now
and
has
had
three
children
It
s
incomprehensible
Don
t
imagine
please
that
I
had
some
preconceived
preference
and
so
am
exaggerating
quite
the
other
way
I
don
t
like
this
absence
of
change
in
her
a
bit
A
woman
of
eight-and-twenty
a
wife
and
a
mother
ought
not
to
be
like
a
little
girl
she
should
have
gained
something
from
life
She
gave
me
a
very
cordial
welcome
but
Priemkov
was
simply
overjoyed
at
my
arrival
the
dear
fellow
seems
on
the
look-out
for
some
one
to
make
much
of
Their
house
is
very
cosy
and
clean
Vera
Nikolaevna
was
dressed
too
like
a
girl
all
in
white
with
a
blue
sash
and
a
slender
gold
chain
on
her
neck
Her
daughter
is
very
sweet
and
not
at
all
like
her
She
reminds
one
of
her
grandmother
In
the
drawing-room
just
over
a
sofa
there
hangs
a
portrait
of
that
strange
woman
a
striking
likeness
It
caught
my
eye
directly
I
went
into
the
room
It
seemed
as
though
she
were
gazing
sternly
and
earnestly
at
me
We
sat
down
spoke
of
old
times
and
by
degrees
got
into
conversation
I
could
not
help
continually
glancing
at
the
gloomy
portrait
of
Madame
Eltsov
Vera
Nikolaevna
was
sitting
just
under
it
it
is
her
favourite
place
Imagine
my
amazement
Vera
Nikolaevna
has
never
yet
read
a
single
novel
a
single
poem
in
fact
not
a
single
invented
work
as
she
expresses
it
This
incomprehensible
indifference
to
the
highest
pleasures
of
the
intellect
irritated
me
In
a
woman
of
intelligence
and
as
far
as
I
can
judge
of
sensibility
it
s
simply
unpardonable
What
do
you
make
it
a
principle
I
asked
never
to
read
books
of
that
sort
I
have
never
happened
to
she
answered
I
haven
t
had
time
Not
time
You
surprise
me
I
should
have
thought
I
went
on
addressing
Priemkov
you
would
have
interested
your
wife
in
poetry
I
should
have
been
delighted
Priemkov
was
beginning
but
Vera
Nikolaevna
interrupted
him
Don
t
pretend
you
ve
no
great
love
for
poetry
yourself
Poetry
well
no
he
began
I
m
not
very
fond
of
it
but
novels
now
But
what
do
you
do
how
do
you
spend
your
evenings
I
queried
do
you
play
cards
We
sometimes
play
she
answered
but
there
s
always
plenty
to
do
We
read
too
there
are
good
books
to
read
besides
poetry
Why
are
you
so
set
against
poetry
I
m
not
set
against
it
I
have
been
used
to
not
reading
these
invented
works
from
a
child
That
was
my
mother
s
wish
and
the
longer
I
live
the
more
I
am
convinced
that
everything
my
mother
did
everything
she
said
was
right
sacredly
right
Well
as
you
will
but
I
can
t
agree
with
you
I
am
certain
you
are
depriving
yourself
quite
needlessly
of
the
purest
the
most
legitimate
pleasure
Why
you
re
not
opposed
to
music
and
painting
I
suppose
why
be
opposed
to
poetry
I
m
not
opposed
to
it
I
have
never
got
to
know
anything
of
it
that
s
all
Well
then
I
will
see
to
that
Your
mother
did
not
I
suppose
wish
to
prevent
your
knowing
anything
of
the
works
of
creative
poetic
art
all
your
life
No
when
I
was
married
my
mother
removed
every
restriction
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
read
what
did
you
call
them
well
anyway
to
read
novels
I
listened
to
Vera
Nikolaevna
in
astonishment
I
had
not
expected
this
She
looked
at
me
with
her
serene
glance
Birds
look
so
when
they
are
not
frightened
I
ll
bring
you
a
book
I
cried
I
thought
of
Faust
which
I
had
just
been
reading
Vera
Nikolaevna
gave
a
gentle
sigh
It
it
won
t
be
Georges
Sand
she
questioned
with
some
timidity
Ah
then
you
ve
heard
of
her
Well
if
it
were
where
s
the
harm
No
I
ll
bring
you
another
author
You
ve
not
forgotten
German
have
you
No
She
speaks
it
like
a
German
put
in
Priemkov
Well
that
s
splendid
I
will
bring
you
but
there
you
shall
see
what
a
wonderful
thing
I
will
bring
you
Very
good
we
shall
see
But
now
let
us
go
into
the
garden
or
there
ll
be
no
keeping
Natasha
still
She
put
on
a
round
straw
hat
a
child
s
hat
just
such
a
one
as
her
daughter
was
wearing
only
a
little
larger
and
we
went
into
the
garden
I
walked
beside
her
In
the
fresh
air
in
the
shade
of
the
tall
limes
I
thought
her
face
looked
sweeter
than
ever
especially
when
she
turned
a
little
and
threw
back
her
head
so
as
to
look
up
at
me
from
under
the
brim
of
her
hat
If
it
had
not
been
for
Priemkov
walking
behind
us
and
the
little
girl
skipping
about
in
front
of
us
I
could
really
have
fancied
I
was
three-and-twenty
instead
of
thirty-five
and
that
I
was
just
on
the
point
of
starting
for
Berlin
especially
as
the
garden
we
were
walking
in
was
very
much
like
the
garden
in
Madame
Eltsov
s
estate
I
could
not
help
expressing
my
feelings
to
Vera
Nikolaevna
Every
one
tells
me
that
I
am
very
little
changed
externally
she
answered
though
indeed
I
have
remained
just
the
same
inwardly
too
We
came
up
to
a
little
Chinese
summer-house
We
had
no
summer-house
like
this
at
Osinovka
she
said
but
you
mustn
t
mind
its
being
so
tumbledown
and
discoloured
it
s
very
nice
and
cool
inside
We
went
into
the
house
I
looked
round
I
tell
you
what
Vera
Nikolaevna
I
observed
you
let
them
bring
a
table
and
some
chairs
in
here
Here
it
is
really
delicious
I
will
read
you
here
Goethe
s
Faust
that
s
the
thing
I
am
going
to
read
you
Yes
there
are
no
flies
here
she
observed
simply
When
will
you
come
The
day
after
to-morrow
Very
well
she
answered
I
will
arrange
it
Natasha
who
had
come
into
the
summer-house
with
us
suddenly
gave
a
shriek
and
jumped
back
quite
pale
What
is
it
inquired
Vera
Nikolaevna
O
mammy
said
the
little
girl
pointing
into
the
corner
look
what
a
dreadful
spider
Vera
Nikolaevna
looked
into
the
corner
a
fat
mottled
spider
was
crawling
slowly
along
the
wall
What
is
there
to
fear
in
that
she
said
It
won
t
bite
look
And
before
I
had
time
to
stop
her
she
took
up
the
hideous
insect
let
it
run
over
her
hand
and
threw
it
away
Well
you
are
brave
I
cried
Where
is
the
bravery
in
that
It
wasn
t
a
venomous
spider
One
can
see
you
are
as
well
up
in
Natural
History
as
ever
but
I
couldn
t
have
held
it
in
my
hand
There
s
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
repeated
Vera
Nikolaevna
Natasha
looked
at
us
both
in
silence
and
laughed
How
like
your
mother
she
is
I
remarked
Yes
rejoined
Vera
Nikolaevna
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
it
is
a
great
happiness
to
me
God
grant
she
may
be
like
her
not
in
face
only
We
were
called
in
to
dinner
and
after
dinner
I
went
away
N.B
The
dinner
was
very
good
and
well-cooked
an
observation
in
parenthesis
for
you
you
gourmand
To-morrow
I
shall
take
them
Faust
I
m
afraid
old
Goethe
and
I
may
not
come
off
very
well
I
will
write
and
tell
you
all
about
it
most
exactly
Well
and
what
do
you
think
of
all
these
proceedings
No
doubt
that
she
has
made
a
great
impression
on
me
that
I
m
on
the
point
of
falling
in
love
and
all
the
rest
of
it
Rubbish
my
dear
boy
There
s
a
limit
to
everything
I
ve
been
fool
enough
No
more
One
can
t
begin
life
over
again
at
my
age
Besides
I
never
did
care
for
women
of
that
sort
Nice
sort
of
women
I
did
care
for
if
you
come
to
that
I
shudder
my
heart
is
sick
I
am
ashamed
of
my
idols
Any
way
I
am
very
glad
of
such
neighbours
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
seeing
something
of
an
intelligent
simple
bright
creature
And
as
to
what
comes
of
it
later
on
you
shall
hear
in
due
time

FOURTH
LETTER
From
the
SAME
to
the
SAME
M
VILLAGE
June
20
1850
The
reading
took
place
yesterday
dear
friend
and
here
follows
the
manner
thereof
First
of
all
I
hasten
to
tell
you
a
success
quite
beyond
all
expectation
success
in
fact
is
not
the
word
Well
I
ll
tell
you
I
arrived
to
dinner
We
sat
down
a
party
of
six
to
dinner
she
Priemkov
their
little
girl
the
governess
an
uninteresting
colourless
figure
I
and
an
old
German
in
a
short
cinnamon-coloured
frock-coat
very
clean
well-shaved
and
brushed
he
had
the
meekest
most
honest
face
and
a
toothless
smile
and
smelled
of
coffee
mixed
with
chicory
all
old
Germans
have
that
peculiar
odour
about
them
I
was
introduced
to
him
he
was
one
Schimmel
a
German
tutor
living
with
the
princes
H
neighbours
of
the
Priemkovs
Vera
Nikolaevna
it
appeared
had
a
liking
for
him
and
had
invited
him
to
be
present
at
the
reading
We
dined
late
and
sat
a
long
while
at
table
and
afterwards
went
a
walk
The
weather
was
exquisite
In
the
morning
there
had
been
rain
and
a
blustering
wind
but
towards
evening
all
was
calm
again
We
came
out
on
to
an
open
meadow
Directly
over
the
meadow
a
great
rosy
cloud
poised
lightly
high
up
in
the
sky
streaks
of
grey
stretched
like
smoke
over
it
on
its
very
edge
continually
peeping
out
and
vanishing
again
quivered
a
little
star
while
a
little
further
off
the
crescent
of
the
moon
shone
white
upon
a
background
of
azure
faintly
flushed
with
red
I
drew
Vera
Nikolaevna
s
attention
to
the
cloud
Yes
she
said
that
is
lovely
but
look
in
this
direction
I
looked
round
An
immense
dark-blue
storm-cloud
rose
up
hiding
the
setting
sun
it
reared
a
crest
like
a
thick
sheaf
flung
upwards
against
the
sky
it
was
surrounded
by
a
bright
rim
of
menacing
purple
which
in
one
place
in
the
very
middle
broke
right
through
its
mighty
mass
like
fire
from
a
burning
crater
There
ll
be
a
storm
remarked
Priemkov
But
I
am
wandering
from
the
main
point
I
forgot
to
tell
you
in
my
last
letter
that
when
I
got
home
from
the
Priemkovs
I
felt
sorry
I
had
mentioned
Faust
Schiller
would
have
been
a
great
deal
better
for
the
first
time
if
it
was
to
be
something
German
I
felt
especially
afraid
of
the
first
scenes
before
the
meeting
with
Gretchen
I
was
not
quite
easy
about
Mephistopheles
either
But
I
was
under
the
spell
of
Faust
and
there
was
nothing
else
I
could
have
read
with
zest
It
was
quite
dark
when
we
went
into
the
summer-house
it
had
been
made
ready
for
us
the
day
before
Just
opposite
the
door
before
a
little
sofa
stood
a
round
table
covered
with
a
cloth
easy-chairs
and
seats
were
placed
round
it
there
was
a
lamp
alight
on
the
table
I
sat
down
on
the
little
sofa
and
took
out
the
book
Vera
Nikolaevna
settled
herself
in
an
easy-chair
a
little
way
off
close
to
the
door
In
the
darkness
through
the
door
a
green
branch
of
acacia
stood
out
in
the
lamplight
swaying
lightly
from
time
to
time
a
flood
of
night
air
flowed
into
the
room
Priemkov
sat
near
me
at
the
table
the
German
beside
him
The
governess
had
remained
in
the
house
with
Natasha
I
made
a
brief
introductory
speech
I
touched
on
the
old
legend
of
doctor
Faust
the
significance
of
Mephistopheles
and
Goethe
himself
and
asked
them
to
stop
me
if
anything
struck
them
as
obscure
Then
I
cleared
my
throat
Priemkov
asked
me
if
I
wouldn
t
have
some
sugar
water
and
one
could
perceive
that
he
was
very
well
satisfied
with
himself
for
having
put
this
question
to
me
I
refused
Profound
silence
reigned
I
began
to
read
without
raising
my
eyes
I
felt
ill
at
ease
my
heart
beat
and
my
voice
shook
The
first
exclamation
of
sympathy
came
from
the
German
and
he
was
the
only
one
to
break
the
silence
all
the
while
I
was
reading
Wonderful
sublime
he
repeated
adding
now
and
then
Ah
that
s
profound
Priemkov
as
far
as
I
could
observe
was
bored
he
did
not
know
German
very
well
and
had
himself
admitted
he
did
not
care
for
poetry
Well
it
was
his
own
doing
I
had
wanted
to
hint
at
dinner
that
his
company
could
be
dispensed
with
at
the
reading
but
I
felt
a
delicacy
about
saying
so
Vera
Nikolaevna
did
not
stir
twice
I
stole
a
glance
at
her
Her
eyes
were
fixed
directly
and
intently
upon
me
her
face
struck
me
as
pale
After
the
first
meeting
of
Faust
with
Gretchen
she
bent
forward
in
her
low
chair
clasped
her
hands
and
remained
motionless
in
that
position
till
the
end
I
felt
that
Priemkov
was
thoroughly
sick
of
it
and
at
first
that
depressed
me
but
gradually
I
forgot
him
warmed
up
and
read
with
fire
with
enthusiasm
I
was
reading
for
Vera
Nikolaevna
alone
an
inner
voice
told
me
that
Faust
was
affecting
her
When
I
finished
the
intermezzo
I
omitted
that
bit
belongs
in
style
to
the
second
part
and
I
skipped
part
too
of
the
Night
on
the
Brocken
when
I
finished
when
that
last
Heinrich
was
heard
the
German
with
much
feeling
commented
My
God
how
splendid
Priemkov
apparently
overjoyed
poor
chap
leaped
up
gave
a
sigh
and
began
thanking
me
for
the
treat
I
had
given
them
But
I
made
him
no
reply
I
looked
towards
Vera
Nikolaevna
I
wanted
to
hear
what
she
would
say
She
got
up
walked
irresolutely
towards
the
door
stood
a
moment
in
the
doorway
and
softly
went
out
into
the
garden
I
rushed
after
her
She
was
already
some
paces
off
her
dress
was
just
visible
a
white
patch
in
the
thick
shadow
Well
I
called
didn
t
you
like
it
She
stopped
Can
you
leave
me
that
book
I
heard
her
voice
saying
I
will
present
it
you
Vera
Nikolaevna
if
you
care
to
have
it
Thank
you
she
answered
and
disappeared
Priemkov
and
the
German
came
up
to
me
How
wonderfully
warm
it
is
observed
Priemkov
it
s
positively
stifling
But
where
has
my
wife
gone
Home
I
think
I
answered
I
suppose
it
will
soon
be
time
for
supper
he
rejoined
You
read
splendidly
he
added
after
a
short
pause
Vera
Nikolaevna
liked
Faust
I
think
said
I
No
doubt
of
it
cried
Priemkov
Oh
of
course
chimed
in
Schimmel
We
went
into
the
house
Where
s
your
mistress
Priemkov
inquired
of
a
maid
who
happened
to
meet
us
She
has
gone
to
her
bedroom
Priemkov
went
off
to
her
bedroom
I
went
out
on
to
the
terrace
with
Schimmel
The
old
man
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
sky
How
many
stars
he
said
slowly
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
all
are
worlds
he
added
and
he
took
another
pinch
I
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
answer
him
and
simply
gazed
upwards
in
silence
A
secret
uncertainty
weighed
upon
my
heart
The
stars
I
fancied
looked
down
seriously
at
us
Five
minutes
later
Priemkov
appeared
and
called
us
into
the
dining-room
Vera
Nikolaevna
came
in
soon
after
We
sat
down
Look
at
Verotchka
Priemkov
said
to
me
I
glanced
at
her
Well
don
t
you
notice
anything
I
certainly
did
notice
a
change
in
her
face
but
I
answered
I
don
t
know
why
No
nothing
Her
eyes
are
red
Priemkov
went
on
I
was
silent
Only
fancy
I
went
upstairs
to
her
and
found
her
crying
It
s
a
long
while
since
such
a
thing
has
happened
to
her
I
can
tell
you
the
last
time
she
cried
it
was
when
our
Sasha
died
You
see
what
you
have
done
with
your
Faust
he
added
with
a
smile
So
you
see
now
Vera
Nikolaevna
I
began
that
I
was
right
when
I
did
not
expect
this
she
interrupted
me
but
God
knows
whether
you
are
right
Perhaps
that
was
the
very
reason
my
mother
forbade
my
reading
such
books
she
knew
Vera
Nikolaevna
stopped
What
did
she
know
I
asked
Tell
me
What
for
I
m
ashamed
of
myself
as
it
is
what
did
I
cry
for
But
we
ll
talk
about
it
another
time
There
was
a
great
deal
I
did
not
quite
understand
Why
didn
t
you
stop
me
I
understood
all
the
words
and
the
meaning
of
them
but
She
did
not
finish
her
sentence
and
looked
away
dreamily
At
that
instant
there
came
from
the
garden
the
sound
of
rustling
leaves
suddenly
fluttering
in
the
rising
wind
Vera
Nikolaevna
started
and
looked
round
towards
the
open
window
I
told
you
there
would
be
a
storm
cried
Priemkov
But
what
made
you
start
like
that
Verotchka
She
glanced
at
him
without
speaking
A
faint
far-off
flash
of
lightning
threw
a
mysterious
light
on
her
motionless
face
It
s
all
due
to
your
Faust
Priemkov
went
on
After
supper
we
must
all
go
to
by-by
Mustn
t
we
Herr
Schimmel
After
intellectual
enjoyment
physical
repose
is
as
grateful
as
it
is
beneficial
responded
the
kind-hearted
German
and
he
drank
a
wine-glass
of
vodka
Immediately
after
supper
we
separated
As
I
said
good-night
to
Vera
Nikolaevna
I
pressed
her
hand
her
hand
was
cold
I
went
up
to
the
room
assigned
to
me
and
stood
a
long
while
at
the
window
before
I
undressed
and
got
into
bed
Priemkov
s
prediction
was
fulfilled
the
storm
came
close
and
broke
I
listened
to
the
roar
of
the
wind
the
patter
and
splash
of
the
rain
and
watched
how
the
church
built
close
by
above
the
lake
at
each
flash
of
lightning
stood
out
at
one
moment
black
against
a
background
of
white
at
the
next
white
against
a
background
of
black
and
then
was
swallowed
up
in
the
darkness
again
But
my
thoughts
were
far
away
I
kept
thinking
of
Vera
Nikolaevna
of
what
she
would
say
to
me
when
she
had
read
Faust
herself
I
thought
of
her
tears
remembered
how
she
had
listened
The
storm
had
long
passed
away
the
stars
came
out
all
was
hushed
around
Some
bird
I
did
not
know
sang
different
notes
several
times
in
succession
repeating
the
same
phrase
Its
clear
solitary
voice
rang
out
strangely
in
the
deep
stillness
and
still
I
did
not
go
to
bed
Next
morning
earlier
than
all
the
rest
I
was
down
in
the
drawing-room
I
stood
before
the
portrait
of
Madame
Eltsov
Aha
I
thought
with
a
secret
feeling
of
ironical
triumph
after
all
I
have
read
your
daughter
a
forbidden
book
All
at
once
I
fancied
you
have
most
likely
noticed
that
eyes
en
face
always
seem
fixed
straight
on
any
one
looking
at
a
picture
but
this
time
I
positively
fancied
the
old
lady
moved
them
with
a
reproachful
look
on
me
I
turned
round
went
to
the
window
and
caught
sight
of
Vera
Nikolaevna
With
a
parasol
on
her
shoulder
and
a
light
white
kerchief
on
her
head
she
was
walking
about
the
garden
I
went
out
at
once
and
said
good-morning
to
her
I
didn
t
sleep
all
night
she
said
my
head
aches
I
came
out
into
the
air
it
may
go
off
Can
that
be
the
result
of
yesterday
s
reading
I
asked
Of
course
I
am
not
used
to
it
There
are
things
in
your
book
I
can
t
get
out
of
my
mind
I
feel
as
though
they
were
simply
turning
my
head
she
added
putting
her
hand
to
her
forehead
That
s
splendid
I
commented
but
I
tell
you
what
I
don
t
like
I
m
afraid
this
sleeplessness
and
headache
may
turn
you
against
reading
such
things
You
think
so
she
responded
and
she
picked
a
sprig
of
wild
jasmine
as
she
passed
God
knows
I
fancy
if
one
has
once
entered
on
that
path
there
is
no
turning
back
She
suddenly
flung
away
the
spray
Come
let
us
sit
down
in
this
arbour
she
went
on
and
please
until
I
talk
of
it
of
my
own
accord
don
t
remind
me
of
that
book
She
seemed
afraid
to
utter
the
name
Faust
We
went
into
the
arbour
and
sat
down
I
won
t
talk
to
you
about
Faust
I
began
but
you
will
let
me
congratulate
you
and
tell
you
that
I
envy
you
You
envy
me
Yes
you
as
I
know
you
now
with
your
soul
have
such
delights
awaiting
you
There
are
great
poets
besides
Goethe
Shakespeare
Schiller
and
indeed
our
own
Pushkin
and
you
must
get
to
know
him
too
She
did
not
speak
and
drew
in
the
sand
with
her
parasol
O
my
friend
Semyon
Nikolaitch
if
you
could
have
seen
how
sweet
she
was
at
that
instant
pale
almost
to
transparency
stooping
forward
a
little
weary
inwardly
perturbed
and
yet
serene
as
the
sky
I
talked
talked
a
long
while
then
ceased
and
sat
in
silence
watching
her
She
did
not
raise
her
eyes
and
went
on
drawing
with
her
parasol
and
rubbing
it
out
again
Suddenly
we
heard
quick
childish
steps
Natasha
ran
into
the
arbour
Vera
Nikolaevna
drew
herself
up
rose
and
to
my
surprise
she
embraced
her
daughter
with
a
sort
of
passionate
tenderness
That
was
not
one
of
her
ways
Then
Priemkov
made
his
appearance
Schimmel
that
grey-haired
but
punctual
innocent
had
left
before
daybreak
so
as
not
to
miss
a
lesson
We
went
in
to
morning
tea
But
I
am
tired
it
s
high
time
to
finish
this
letter
It
s
sure
to
strike
you
as
foolish
and
confused
I
feel
confused
myself
I
m
not
myself
I
don
t
know
what
s
the
matter
with
me
I
am
continually
haunted
by
a
little
room
with
bare
walls
a
lamp
an
open
door
the
fragrance
and
freshness
of
the
night
and
there
near
the
door
an
intent
youthful
face
light
white
garments
I
understand
now
why
I
wanted
to
marry
her
I
was
not
so
stupid
it
seems
before
my
stay
in
Berlin
as
I
had
hitherto
supposed
Yes
Semyon
Nikolaitch
your
friend
is
in
a
curious
frame
of
mind
All
this
I
know
will
pass
off
and
if
it
doesn
t
pass
off
well
what
then
it
won
t
pass
off
and
that
s
all
But
any
way
I
am
well
satisfied
with
myself
in
the
first
place
I
have
spent
an
exquisite
evening
and
secondly
if
I
have
awakened
that
soul
who
can
blame
me
Old
Madame
Eltsov
is
nailed
up
on
the
wall
and
must
hold
her
peace
The
old
thing
I
don
t
know
all
the
details
of
her
life
but
I
know
she
ran
away
from
her
father
s
house
she
was
not
half
Italian
for
nothing
it
seems
She
wanted
to
keep
her
daughter
secure
we
shall
see
I
must
put
down
my
pen
You
jeering
person
pray
think
what
you
like
of
me
only
don
t
jeer
at
me
in
writing
You
and
I
are
old
friends
and
ought
to
spare
each
other
Good-bye
Yours

FIFTH
LETTER
From
the
SAME
to
the
SAME
M
VILLAGE
July
26
1850
It
s
a
long
time
since
I
wrote
to
you
dear
Semyon
Nicolaitch
more
than
a
month
I
think
I
had
enough
to
write
about
but
I
was
overcome
by
laziness
To
tell
the
truth
I
have
hardly
thought
of
you
all
this
time
But
from
your
last
letter
to
me
I
gather
that
you
are
drawing
conclusions
in
regard
to
me
which
are
unjust
that
is
to
say
not
altogether
just
You
imagine
I
have
fallen
in
love
with
Vera
I
feel
it
awkward
somehow
to
call
her
Vera
Nikolaevna
you
are
wrong
Of
course
I
see
her
often
I
like
her
extremely
indeed
who
wouldn
t
like
her
I
should
like
to
see
you
in
my
place
She
s
an
exquisite
creature
Rapid
intuition
together
with
the
inexperience
