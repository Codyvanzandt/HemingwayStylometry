high
road
in
a
peasant
's
hut
where
he
would
find
nothing
but
bread
and
hay
but
on
the
other
hand
would
not
have
to
pay
an
extra
kopeck
Apart
from
its
favourable
situation
the
inn
with
which
our
story
deals
had
many
attractions
excellent
water
in
two
deep
wells
with
creaking
wheels
and
iron
buckets
on
a
chain
a
spacious
yard
with
a
tiled
roof
on
posts
abundant
stores
of
oats
in
the
cellar
a
warm
outer
room
with
a
very
huge
Russian
stove
with
long
horizontal
flues
attached
that
looked
like
titanic
shoulders
and
lastly
two
fairly
clean
rooms
with
the
walls
covered
with
reddish
lilac
paper
somewhat
frayed
at
the
lower
edge
with
a
painted
wooden
sofa
chairs
to
match
and
two
pots
of
geraniums
in
the
windows
which
were
however
never
cleaned
and
were
dingy
with
the
dust
of
years
The
inn
had
other
advantages
the
blacksmith
's
was
close
by
the
mill
was
just
at
hand
and
lastly
one
could
get
a
good
meal
in
it
thanks
to
the
cook
a
fat
and
red-faced
peasant
woman
who
prepared
rich
and
appetizing
dishes
and
dealt
out
provisions
without
stint
the
nearest
tavern
was
reckoned
not
half
a
mile
away
the
host
kept
snuff
which
though
mixed
with
wood-ash
was
extremely
pungent
and
pleasantly
irritated
the
nose
in
fact
there
were
many
reasons
why
visitors
of
all
sorts
were
never
lacking
in
that
inn
It
was
liked
by
those
who
used
it
and
that
is
the
chief
thing
without
which
nothing
of
course
would
succeed
and
it
was
liked
principally
as
it
was
said
in
the
district
because
the
host
himself
was
very
fortunate
and
successful
in
all
his
undertakings
though
he
did
not
much
deserve
his
good
fortune
but
it
seems
if
a
man
is
lucky
he
is
lucky
The
innkeeper
was
a
man
of
the
working
class
called
Naum
Ivanov
He
was
a
man
of
middle
height
with
broad
stooping
shoulders
he
had
a
big
round
head
and
curly
hair
already
grey
though
he
did
not
look
more
than
forty
a
full
and
fresh
face
a
low
but
white
and
smooth
forehead
and
little
bright
blue
eyes
out
of
which
he
looked
in
a
very
queer
way
from
under
his
brows
and
yet
with
an
insolent
expression
a
combination
not
often
met
with
He
always
held
his
head
down
and
seemed
to
turn
it
with
difficulty
perhaps
because
his
neck
was
very
short
He
walked
at
a
trot
and
did
not
swing
his
arms
but
slowly
moved
them
with
his
fists
clenched
as
he
walked
When
he
smiled
and
he
smiled
often
without
laughing
as
it
were
smiling
to
himself
his
thick
lips
parted
unpleasantly
and
displayed
a
row
of
close-set
brilliant
teeth
He
spoke
jerkily
and
with
a
surly
note
in
his
voice
He
shaved
his
beard
but
dressed
in
Russian
style
His
costume
consisted
of
a
long
always
threadbare
full
coat
full
breeches
and
shoes
on
his
bare
feet
He
was
often
away
from
home
on
business
and
he
had
a
great
deal
of
business
he
was
a
horse-dealer
he
rented
land
had
a
market
garden
bought
up
orchards
and
traded
in
various
ways
but
his
absences
never
lasted
long
like
a
kite
to
which
he
had
considerable
resemblance
especially
in
the
expression
of
his
eyes
he
used
to
return
to
his
nest
He
knew
how
to
keep
that
nest
in
order
He
was
everywhere
he
listened
to
everything
and
gave
orders
served
out
stores
sent
things
out
and
made
up
his
accounts
himself
and
never
knocked
off
a
farthing
from
anyone
's
account
but
never
asked
more
than
his
due
The
visitors
did
not
talk
to
him
and
indeed
he
did
not
care
to
waste
words
I
want
your
money
and
you
want
my
victuals
he
used
to
say
as
it
were
jerking
out
each
word
We
have
not
met
for
a
christening
the
traveller
has
eaten
has
fed
his
beasts
no
need
to
sit
on
If
he
is
tired
let
him
sleep
without
chattering
The
labourers
he
kept
were
healthy
grown-up
men
but
docile
and
well
broken
in
they
were
very
much
afraid
of
him
He
never
touched
intoxicating
liquor
and
he
used
to
give
his
men
ten
kopecks
for
vodka
on
the
great
holidays
they
did
not
dare
to
drink
on
other
days
People
like
Naum
quickly
get
rich
but
to
the
magnificent
position
in
which
he
found
himself
and
he
was
believed
to
be
worth
forty
or
fifty
thousand
roubles
Naum
Ivanov
had
not
arrived
by
the
strait
path
The
inn
had
existed
on
the
same
spot
on
the
high
road
twenty
years
before
the
time
from
which
we
date
the
beginning
of
our
story
It
is
true
that
it
had
not
then
the
dark
red
shingle
roof
which
made
Naum
Ivanov
's
inn
look
like
a
gentleman
's
house
it
was
inferior
in
construction
and
had
thatched
roofs
in
the
courtyard
and
a
humble
fence
instead
of
a
wall
of
logs
nor
had
it
been
distinguished
by
the
triangular
Greek
pediment
on
carved
posts
but
all
the
same
it
had
been
a
capital
inn
roomy
solid
and
warm
and
travellers
were
glad
to
frequent
it
The
innkeeper
at
that
time
was
not
Naum
Ivanov
but
a
certain
Akim
Semyonitch
a
serf
belonging
to
a
neighbouring
lady
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
Kuntse
the
widow
of
a
staff
officer
This
Akim
was
a
shrewd
trading
peasant
who
having
left
home
in
his
youth
with
two
wretched
nags
to
work
as
a
carrier
had
returned
a
year
later
with
three
decent
horses
and
had
spent
almost
all
the
rest
of
his
life
on
the
high
roads
he
used
to
go
to
Kazan
and
Odessa
to
Orenburg
and
to
Warsaw
and
abroad
to
Leipsic
and
used
in
the
end
to
travel
with
two
teams
each
of
three
stout
sturdy
stallions
harnessed
to
two
huge
carts
Whether
it
was
that
he
was
sick
of
his
life
of
homeless
wandering
whether
it
was
that
he
wanted
to
rear
a
family
his
wife
had
died
in
one
of
his
absences
and
what
children
she
had
borne
him
were
dead
also
anyway
he
made
up
his
mind
at
last
to
abandon
his
old
calling
and
to
open
an
inn
With
the
permission
of
his
mistress
he
settled
on
the
high
road
bought
in
her
name
about
an
acre
and
a
half
of
land
and
built
an
inn
upon
it
The
undertaking
prospered
He
had
more
than
enough
money
to
furnish
and
stock
it
The
experience
he
had
gained
in
the
course
of
his
years
of
travelling
from
one
end
of
Russia
to
another
was
of
great
advantage
to
him
he
knew
how
to
please
his
visitors
especially
his
former
mates
the
drivers
of
troikas
many
of
whom
he
knew
personally
and
whose
good-will
is
particularly
valued
by
innkeepers
as
they
need
so
much
food
for
themselves
and
their
powerful
beasts
Akim
's
inn
became
celebrated
for
hundreds
of
miles
round
People
were
even
readier
to
stay
with
him
than
with
his
successor
Naum
though
Akim
could
not
be
compared
with
Naum
as
a
manager
Under
Akim
everything
was
in
the
old-fashioned
style
snug
but
not
over
clean
and
his
oats
were
apt
to
be
light
or
musty
the
cooking
too
was
somewhat
indifferent
dishes
were
sometimes
put
on
the
table
which
would
better
have
been
left
in
the
oven
and
it
was
not
that
he
was
stingy
with
the
provisions
but
just
that
the
cook
had
not
looked
after
them
On
the
other
hand
he
was
ready
to
knock
off
something
from
the
price
and
did
not
refuse
to
trust
a
man
's
word
for
payment
he
was
a
good
man
and
a
genial
host
In
talking
in
entertaining
he
was
lavish
too
he
would
sometimes
chatter
away
over
the
samovar
till
his
listeners
pricked
up
their
ears
especially
when
he
began
telling
them
about
Petersburg
about
the
Circassian
steppes
or
even
about
foreign
parts
and
he
liked
getting
a
little
drunk
with
a
good
companion
but
not
disgracefully
so
more
for
the
sake
of
company
as
his
guests
used
to
say
of
him
He
was
a
great
favourite
with
merchants
and
with
all
people
of
what
is
called
the
old
school
who
do
not
set
off
for
a
journey
without
tightening
up
their
belts
and
never
go
into
a
room
without
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
never
enter
into
conversation
with
a
man
without
first
wishing
him
good
health
Even
Akim
's
appearance
disposed
people
in
his
favour
he
was
tall
rather
thin
but
graceful
even
at
his
advanced
years
he
had
a
long
face
with
fine-looking
regular
features
a
high
and
open
brow
a
straight
and
delicate
nose
and
a
small
mouth
His
brown
and
prominent
eyes
positively
shone
with
friendly
gentleness
his
soft
scanty
hair
curled
in
little
rings
about
his
neck
he
had
very
little
left
on
the
top
of
his
head
Akim
's
voice
was
very
pleasant
though
weak
in
his
youth
he
had
been
a
good
singer
but
continual
travelling
in
the
open
air
in
the
winter
had
affected
his
chest
But
he
talked
very
smoothly
and
sweetly
When
he
laughed
wrinkles
like
rays
that
were
very
charming
came
round
his
eyes
such
wrinkles
are
only
to
be
seen
in
kind-hearted
people
Akim
's
movements
were
for
the
most
part
deliberate
and
not
without
a
certain
confidence
and
dignified
courtesy
befitting
a
man
of
experience
who
had
seen
a
great
deal
in
his
day
In
fact
Akim
or
Akim
Semyonitch
as
he
was
called
even
in
his
mistress
's
house
to
which
he
often
went
and
invariably
on
Sundays
after
mass
would
have
been
excellent
in
all
respects
if
he
had
not
had
one
weakness
which
has
been
the
ruin
of
many
men
on
earth
and
was
in
the
end
the
ruin
of
him
too
a
weakness
for
the
fair
sex
Akim's
susceptibility
was
extreme
his
heart
could
never
resist
a
woman's
glance
he
melted
before
it
like
the
first
snow
of
autumn
in
the
sun
and
dearly
he
had
to
pay
for
his
excessive
sensibility
For
the
first
year
after
he
had
set
up
on
the
high
road
Akim
was
so
busy
with
building
his
yard
stocking
the
place
and
all
the
business
inseparable
from
moving
into
a
new
house
that
he
had
absolutely
no
time
to
think
of
women
and
if
any
sinful
thought
came
into
his
mind
he
immediately
drove
it
away
by
reading
various
devotional
works
for
which
he
cherished
a
profound
respect
he
had
learned
to
read
when
first
he
left
home
singing
the
psalms
in
a
low
voice
or
some
other
pious
occupation
Besides
he
was
then
in
his
forty-sixth
year
and
at
that
time
of
life
every
passion
grows
perceptibly
calmer
and
cooler
and
the
time
for
marrying
was
past
Akim
himself
began
to
think
that
as
he
expressed
it
this
foolishness
was
over
and
done
with
But
evidently
there
is
no
escaping
one
's
fate
Akim
's
former
mistress
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
Kuntse
the
widow
of
an
officer
of
German
extraction
was
herself
a
native
of
Mittau
where
she
had
spent
the
first
years
of
her
childhood
and
where
she
had
numerous
poor
relations
about
whom
she
concerned
herself
very
little
especially
after
a
casual
visit
from
one
of
her
brothers
an
infantry
officer
of
the
line
On
the
day
after
his
arrival
he
had
made
a
great
disturbance
and
almost
beaten
the
lady
of
the
house
calling
her
du
lumpenmamselle
though
only
the
evening
before
he
had
called
her
in
broken
Russian
sister
and
benefactor
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
lived
almost
permanently
on
her
pretty
estate
which
had
been
won
by
the
labours
of
her
husband
who
had
been
an
architect
She
managed
it
herself
and
managed
it
very
well
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
never
let
slip
the
slightest
advantage
she
turned
everything
into
profit
for
herself
and
this
as
well
as
her
extraordinary
capacity
for
making
a
farthing
do
the
work
of
a
halfpenny
betrayed
her
German
origin
in
everything
else
she
had
become
very
Russian
She
kept
a
considerable
number
of
house
serfs
especially
many
maids
who
earned
their
salt
however
from
morning
to
night
their
backs
were
bent
over
their
work
She
liked
driving
out
in
her
carriage
with
grooms
in
livery
on
the
footboard
She
liked
listening
to
gossip
and
scandal
and
was
a
clever
scandal-monger
herself
she
liked
to
lavish
favours
upon
someone
then
suddenly
crush
him
with
her
displeasure
in
fact
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
behaved
exactly
like
a
lady
Akim
was
in
her
good
graces
he
paid
her
punctually
every
year
a
very
considerable
sum
in
lieu
of
service
she
talked
graciously
to
him
and
even
in
jest
invited
him
as
a
guest
but
it
was
precisely
in
his
mistress
's
house
that
trouble
was
in
store
for
Akim
Among
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
's
maidservants
was
an
orphan
girl
of
twenty
called
Dunyasha
She
was
good-looking
graceful
and
neat-handed
though
her
features
were
irregular
they
were
pleasing
her
fresh
complexion
her
thick
flaxen
hair
her
lively
grey
eyes
her
little
round
nose
her
rosy
lips
and
above
all
her
half-mocking
half-provocative
expression
were
all
rather
charming
in
their
way
At
the
same
time
in
spite
of
her
forlorn
position
she
was
strict
almost
haughty
in
her
deportment
She
came
of
a
long
line
of
house
serfs
Her
father
Arefy
had
been
a
butler
for
thirty
years
while
her
grandfather
Stepan
had
been
valet
to
a
prince
and
officer
of
the
Guards
long
since
dead
She
dressed
neatly
and
was
vain
over
her
hands
which
were
certainly
very
beautiful
Dunyasha
made
a
show
of
great
disdain
for
all
her
admirers
she
listened
to
their
compliments
with
a
self-complacent
little
smile
and
if
she
answered
them
at
all
it
was
usually
some
exclamation
such
as
Yes
Likely
As
though
I
should
What
next
These
exclamations
were
always
on
her
lips
Dunyasha
had
spent
about
three
years
being
trained
in
Moscow
where
she
had
picked
up
the
peculiar
airs
and
graces
which
distinguish
maidservants
who
have
been
in
Moscow
or
Petersburg
She
was
spoken
of
as
a
girl
of
self-respect
high
praise
on
the
lips
of
house
serfs
who
though
she
had
seen
something
of
life
had
not
let
herself
down
She
was
rather
clever
with
her
needle
too
yet
with
all
this
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
was
not
very
warmly
disposed
toward
her
thanks
to
the
headmaid
Kirillovna
a
sly
and
intriguing
woman
no
longer
young
Kirillovna
exercised
great
influence
over
her
mistress
and
very
skilfully
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
all
rivals
With
this
Dunyasha
Akim
must
needs
fall
in
love
And
he
fell
in
love
as
he
had
never
fallen
in
love
before
He
saw
her
first
at
church
she
had
only
just
come
back
from
Moscow
Afterwards
he
met
her
several
times
in
his
mistress
's
house
finally
he
spent
a
whole
evening
with
her
at
the
steward
's
where
he
had
been
invited
to
tea
in
company
with
other
highly
respected
persons
The
house
serfs
did
not
disdain
him
though
he
was
not
of
their
class
and
wore
a
beard
he
was
a
man
of
education
could
read
and
write
and
what
was
more
had
money
and
he
did
not
dress
like
a
peasant
but
wore
a
long
full
coat
of
black
cloth
high
boots
of
calf
leather
and
a
kerchief
on
his
neck
It
is
true
that
some
of
the
house
serfs
did
say
among
themselves
that
One
can
see
that
he
is
not
one
of
us
but
to
his
face
they
almost
flattered
him
On
that
evening
at
the
steward
's
Dunyasha
made
a
complete
conquest
of
Akim
's
susceptible
heart
though
she
said
not
a
single
word
in
answer
to
his
ingratiating
speeches
and
only
looked
sideways
at
him
from
time
to
time
as
though
wondering
why
that
peasant
was
there
All
that
only
added
fuel
to
the
flames
He
went
home
pondered
and
pondered
and
made
up
his
mind
to
win
her
hand
She
had
somehow
bewitched
him
But
how
can
I
describe
the
wrath
and
indignation
of
Dunyasha
when
five
days
later
Kirillovna
with
a
friendly
air
invited
her
into
her
room
and
told
her
that
Akim
and
evidently
he
knew
how
to
set
to
work
that
bearded
peasant
Akim
to
sit
by
whose
side
she
considered
almost
an
indignity
was
courting
her
Dunyasha
first
flushed
crimson
then
she
gave
a
forced
laugh
then
she
burst
into
tears
but
Kirillovna
made
her
attack
so
artfully
made
the
girl
feel
her
own
position
in
the
house
so
clearly
so
tactfully
hinted
at
the
presentable
appearance
the
wealth
and
blind
devotion
of
Akim
and
finally
mentioned
so
significantly
the
wishes
of
their
mistress
that
Dunyasha
went
out
of
the
room
with
a
look
of
hesitation
on
her
face
and
meeting
Akim
only
gazed
intently
into
his
face
and
did
not
turn
away
The
indescribably
lavish
presents
of
the
love-sick
man
dissipated
her
last
doubts
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
to
whom
Akim
in
his
joy
took
a
hundred
peaches
on
a
large
silver
dish
gave
her
consent
to
the
marriage
and
the
marriage
took
place
Akim
spared
no
expense
and
the
bride
who
on
the
eve
of
her
wedding
at
her
farewell
party
to
her
girl
friends
sat
looking
a
figure
of
misery
and
who
cried
all
the
next
morning
while
Kirillovna
was
dressing
her
for
the
wedding
was
soon
comforted
Her
mistress
gave
her
her
own
shawl
to
wear
in
the
church
and
Akim
presented
her
the
same
day
with
one
like
it
almost
superior
And
so
Akim
was
married
and
took
his
young
bride
home
They
began
their
life
together
Dunyasha
turned
out
to
be
a
poor
housewife
a
poor
helpmate
to
her
husband
She
took
no
interest
in
anything
was
melancholy
and
depressed
unless
some
officer
sitting
by
the
big
samovar
noticed
her
and
paid
her
compliments
she
was
often
absent
sometimes
in
the
town
shopping
sometimes
at
the
mistress
's
house
which
was
only
three
miles
from
the
inn
There
she
felt
at
home
there
she
was
surrounded
by
her
own
people
the
girls
envied
her
finery
Kirillovna
regaled
her
with
tea
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
herself
talked
to
her
But
even
these
visits
did
not
pass
without
some
bitter
experiences
for
Dunyasha
As
an
innkeeper
's
wife
for
instance
she
could
not
wear
a
hat
and
was
obliged
to
tie
up
her
head
in
a
kerchief
like
a
merchant
's
lady
said
sly
Kirillovna
like
a
working
woman
thought
Dunyasha
to
herself
More
than
once
Akim
recalled
the
words
of
his
only
relation
an
uncle
who
had
lived
in
solitude
without
a
family
for
years
Well
Akimushka
my
lad
he
had
said
meeting
him
in
the
street
I
hear
you
are
getting
married
Why
yes
what
of
it
Ech
Akim
Akim
You
are
above
us
peasants
now
there
's
no
denying
that
but
you
are
not
on
her
level
either
In
what
way
not
on
her
level
Why
in
that
way
for
instance
his
uncle
had
answered
pointing
to
Akim
's
beard
which
he
had
begun
to
clip
in
order
to
please
his
betrothed
though
he
had
refused
to
shave
it
completely
Akim
looked
down
while
the
old
man
turned
away
wrapped
his
tattered
sheepskin
about
him
and
walked
away
shaking
his
head
Yes
more
than
once
Akim
sank
into
thought
cleared
his
throat
and
sighed
But
his
love
for
his
pretty
wife
was
no
less
he
was
proud
of
her
especially
when
he
compared
her
not
merely
with
peasant
women
or
with
his
first
wife
to
whom
he
had
been
married
at
sixteen
but
with
other
serf
girls
look
what
a
fine
bird
we
have
caught
he
thought
to
himself
Her
slightest
caress
gave
him
immense
pleasure
Maybe
he
thought
she
will
get
used
to
it
maybe
she
will
get
into
the
way
of
it
Meanwhile
her
behaviour
was
irreproachable
and
no
one
could
say
anything
against
her
Several
years
passed
like
this
Dunyasha
really
did
end
by
growing
used
to
her
way
of
life
Akim
's
love
for
her
and
confidence
in
her
only
increased
as
he
grew
older
her
girl
friends
who
had
been
married
not
to
peasants
were
suffering
cruel
hardships
either
from
poverty
or
from
having
fallen
into
bad
hands
Akim
went
on
getting
richer
and
richer
Everything
succeeded
with
him
he
was
always
lucky
only
one
thing
was
a
grief
God
had
not
given
him
children
Dunyasha
was
by
now
over
five
and
twenty
everyone
addressed
her
as
Avdotya
Arefyevna
She
never
became
a
real
housewife
however
but
she
grew
fond
of
her
house
looked
after
the
stores
and
superintended
the
woman
who
worked
in
the
house
It
is
true
that
she
did
all
this
only
after
a
fashion
she
did
not
keep
up
a
high
standard
of
cleanliness
and
order
on
the
other
hand
her
portrait
painted
in
oils
and
ordered
by
herself
from
a
local
artist
the
son
of
the
parish
deacon
hung
on
the
wall
of
the
chief
room
beside
that
of
Akim
She
was
depicted
in
a
white
dress
with
a
yellow
shawl
with
six
strings
of
big
pearls
round
her
neck
long
earrings
and
a
ring
on
every
finger
The
portrait
was
recognisable
though
the
artist
had
painted
her
excessively
stout
and
rosy
and
had
made
her
eyes
not
grey
but
black
and
even
slightly
squinting
Akim
's
was
a
complete
failure
the
portrait
had
come
out
dark
la
Rembrandt
so
that
sometimes
a
visitor
would
go
up
to
it
look
at
it
and
merely
give
an
inarticulate
murmur
Avdotya
had
taken
to
being
rather
careless
in
her
dress
she
would
fling
a
big
shawl
over
her
shoulders
while
the
dress
under
it
was
put
on
anyhow
she
was
overcome
by
laziness
that
sighing
apathetic
drowsy
laziness
to
which
the
Russian
is
only
too
liable
especially
when
his
livelihood
is
secure
With
all
that
the
fortunes
of
Akim
and
his
wife
prospered
exceedingly
they
lived
in
harmony
and
had
the
reputation
of
an
exemplary
pair
But
just
as
a
squirrel
will
wash
its
face
at
the
very
instant
when
the
sportsman
is
aiming
at
it
man
has
no
presentiment
of
his
troubles
till
all
of
a
sudden
the
ground
gives
way
under
him
like
ice
One
autumn
evening
a
merchant
in
the
drapery
line
put
up
at
Akim's
inn
He
was
journeying
by
various
cross-country
roads
from
Moscow
to
Harkov
with
two
loaded
tilt
carts
he
was
one
of
those
travelling
traders
whose
arrival
is
sometimes
awaited
with
such
impatience
by
country
gentlemen
and
still
more
by
their
wives
and
daughters
This
travelling
merchant
an
elderly
man
had
with
him
two
companions
or
speaking
more
correctly
two
workmen
one
thin
pale
and
hunchbacked
the
other
a
fine
handsome
young
fellow
of
twenty
They
asked
for
supper
then
sat
down
to
tea
the
merchant
invited
the
innkeeper
and
his
wife
to
take
a
cup
with
him
they
did
not
refuse
A
conversation
quickly
sprang
up
between
the
two
old
men
Akim
was
fifty-six
the
merchant
inquired
about
the
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
and
no
one
could
give
him
more
useful
information
about
them
than
Akim
the
hunchbacked
workman
spent
his
time
looking
after
the
carts
and
finally
went
off
to
bed
it
fell
to
Avdotya
to
talk
to
the
other
one
She
sat
by
him
and
said
little
rather
listening
to
what
he
told
her
but
it
was
evident
that
his
talk
pleased
her
her
face
grew
more
animated
the
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
and
she
laughed
readily
and
often
The
young
workman
sat
almost
motionless
with
his
curly
head
bent
over
the
table
he
spoke
quietly
without
haste
and
without
raising
his
voice
but
his
eyes
not
large
but
saucily
bright
and
blue
were
rivetted
on
Avdotya
at
first
she
turned
away
from
them
then
she
too
began
looking
him
in
the
face
The
young
fellow
's
face
was
fresh
and
smooth
as
a
Crimean
apple
he
often
smiled
and
tapped
with
his
white
fingers
on
his
chin
covered
with
soft
dark
down
He
spoke
like
a
merchant
but
very
freely
and
with
a
sort
of
careless
self-confidence
and
went
on
looking
at
her
with
the
same
intent
impudent
stare
All
at
once
he
moved
a
little
closer
to
her
and
without
the
slightest
change
of
countenance
said
to
her
Avdotya
Arefyevna
there
's
no
one
like
you
in
the
world
I
am
ready
to
die
for
you
Avdotya
laughed
aloud
What
is
it
asked
Akim
Why
he
keeps
saying
such
funny
things
she
said
without
any
particular
embarrassment
The
old
merchant
grinned
Ha
ha
yes
my
Naum
is
such
a
funny
fellow
do
n't
listen
to
him
Oh
Really
As
though
I
should
she
answered
and
shook
her
head
Ha
ha
of
course
not
observed
the
old
man
But
however
he
went
on
in
a
singsong
voice
we
will
take
our
leave
we
are
thoroughly
satisfied
it
is
time
for
bed
and
he
got
up
We
are
well
satisfied
too
Akim
brought
out
and
he
got
up
for
your
entertainment
that
is
but
we
wish
you
a
good
night
Avdotyushka
come
along
Avdotya
got
up
as
it
were
unwillingly
Naum
too
got
up
after
her
the
party
broke
up
The
innkeeper
and
his
wife
went
off
to
the
little
lobby
partitioned
off
which
served
them
as
a
bedroom
Akim
was
snoring
immediately
It
was
a
long
time
before
Avdotya
could
get
to
sleep
At
first
she
lay
still
turning
her
face
to
the
wall
then
she
began
tossing
from
side
to
side
on
the
hot
feather
bed
throwing
off
and
pulling
up
the
quilt
alternately
then
she
sank
into
a
light
doze
Suddenly
she
heard
from
the
yard
a
loud
masculine
voice
it
was
singing
a
song
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
the
words
prolonging
each
note
though
not
with
a
melancholy
effect
Avdotya
opened
her
eyes
propped
herself
on
her
elbows
and
listened
The
song
went
on
It
rang
out
musically
in
the
autumn
air
Akim
raised
his
head
Who
's
that
singing
he
asked
I
do
n't
know
she
answered
He
sings
well
he
added
after
a
brief
pause
Very
well
What
a
strong
voice
I
used
to
sing
in
my
day
he
went
on
And
I
sang
well
too
but
my
voice
has
gone
That
's
a
fine
voice
It
must
be
that
young
fellow
singing
Naum
is
his
name
is
n't
it
And
he
turned
over
on
the
other
side
gave
a
sigh
and
fell
asleep
again
It
was
a
long
time
before
the
voice
was
still
Avdotya
listened
and
listened
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
break
off
rang
out
boldly
once
more
and
slowly
died
away
Avdotya
crossed
herself
and
laid
her
head
on
the
pillow
Half
an
hour
passed
She
sat
up
and
softly
got
out
of
bed
Where
are
you
going
wife
Akim
asked
in
his
sleep
She
stopped
To
see
to
the
little
lamp
she
said
I
ca
n't
get
to
sleep
You
should
say
a
prayer
Akim
mumbled
falling
asleep
Avdotya
went
up
to
the
lamp
before
the
ikon
began
trimming
it
and
accidentally
put
it
out
she
went
back
and
lay
down
Everything
was
still
Early
next
morning
the
merchant
set
off
again
on
his
journey
with
his
companions
Avdotya
was
asleep
Akim
went
half
a
mile
with
them
he
had
to
call
at
the
mill
When
he
got
home
he
found
his
wife
dressed
and
not
alone
Naum
the
young
man
who
had
been
there
the
night
before
was
with
her
They
were
standing
by
the
table
in
the
window
talking
When
Avdotya
saw
Akim
she
went
out
of
the
room
without
a
word
and
Naum
said
that
he
had
come
for
his
master
's
gloves
which
the
latter
he
said
had
left
behind
on
the
bench
and
he
too
went
away
We
will
now
tell
the
reader
what
he
has
probably
guessed
already
Avdotya
had
fallen
passionately
in
love
with
Naum
It
is
hard
to
say
how
it
could
have
happened
so
quickly
especially
as
she
had
hitherto
been
irreproachable
in
her
behaviour
in
spite
of
many
opportunities
and
temptations
to
deceive
her
husband
Later
on
when
her
intrigue
with
Naum
became
known
many
people
in
the
neighbourhood
declared
that
he
had
on
the
very
first
evening
put
a
magic
potion
that
was
a
love
spell
in
her
tea
the
efficacy
of
such
spells
is
still
firmly
believed
in
among
us
and
that
this
could
be
clearly
seen
from
the
appearance
of
Avdotya
who
so
they
said
soon
after
began
to
pine
away
and
look
depressed
However
that
may
have
been
Naum
began
to
be
frequently
seen
in
Akim's
yard
At
first
he
came
again
with
the
same
merchant
and
three
months
later
arrived
alone
with
wares
of
his
own
then
the
report
spread
that
he
had
settled
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
district
towns
and
from
that
time
forward
not
a
week
passed
without
his
appearing
on
the
high
road
with
his
strong
painted
cart
drawn
by
two
sleek
horses
which
he
drove
himself
There
was
no
particular
friendship
between
Akim
and
him
nor
was
there
any
hostility
noticed
between
them
Akim
did
not
take
much
notice
of
him
and
only
thought
of
him
as
a
sharp
young
fellow
who
was
rapidly
making
his
way
in
the
world
He
did
not
suspect
Avdotya
's
real
feelings
and
went
on
believing
in
her
as
before
Two
years
passed
like
this
One
summer
day
it
happened
that
Lizaveta
Prohorovna
who
had
somehow
suddenly
grown
yellow
and
wrinkled
during
those
two
years
in
spite
of
all
sorts
of
unguents
rouge
and
powder
about
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
went
out
with
her
lap
dog
and
her
folding
parasol
for
a
stroll
before
dinner
in
her
neat
little
German
garden
With
a
faint
rustle
of
her
starched
petticoats
she
walked
with
tiny
steps
along
the
sandy
path
between
two
rows
of
erect
stiffly
tied-up
dahlias
when
she
was
suddenly
overtaken
by
our
old
acquaintance
