rose
to
his
feet
a
permanently
lamed
man
When
his
father
had
finished
wringing
his
hands
over
the
mischance
he
sent
his
son
to
acquire
a
civilian
education
whence
it
came
about
that
Nikolai
at
eighteen
found
himself
a
student
at
the
University
of
St
Petersburg
At
the
same
period
his
brother
obtained
a
commission
in
one
of
the
regiments
of
Guards
and
that
being
so
their
father
apportioned
the
two
young
men
a
joint
establishment
and
placed
it
under
the
more
or
less
detached
supervision
of
Ilya
Koliazin
their
maternal
uncle
and
a
leading
tchinovnik
3
That
done
the
father
returned
to
his
division
and
his
wife
and
only
at
rare
intervals
sent
his
sons
sheets
of
grey
foolscap
scrawled
and
re-scrawled
in
flamboyant
calligraphy
to
which
there
was
appended
amid
a
bower
of
laborious
flourishes
the
signature
Piotr
Kirsanov
Major-General
In
the
year
1835
Nikolai
Petrovitch
obtained
his
university
degree
and
in
the
same
year
General
Kirsanov
was
retired
for
incompetence
at
a
review
and
decided
to
transfer
his
quarters
to
St
Petersburg
Unfortunately
just
as
he
was
on
the
point
both
of
renting
a
house
near
the
Tavritchesky
Gardens
and
of
being
enrolled
as
a
member
of
the
English
Club
a
stroke
put
an
end
to
his
career
and
Agathoklea
Kuzminishna
followed
him
soon
afterwards
since
never
had
she
succeeded
in
taking
to
the
dull
life
of
the
capital
but
always
had
hankered
after
the
old
provincial
existence
Already
during
his
parents
lifetime
and
to
their
no
small
vexation
Nikolai
Petrovitch
had
contrived
to
fall
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
a
certain
tchinovnik
named
Prepolovensky
the
landlord
of
his
flat
and
since
the
maiden
was
not
only
comely
but
one
of
the
type
known
as
advanced
that
is
to
say
she
perused
an
occasional
Science
article
in
one
newspaper
or
another
he
married
her
out
of
hand
as
soon
as
the
term
of
mourning
was
ended
and
abandoning
the
Ministry
of
Provincial
Affairs
to
which
through
his
father
's
influence
he
had
been
posted
embarked
upon
connubial
felicity
in
a
villa
adjoining
the
Institute
of
Forestry
Thence
after
a
while
the
couple
removed
to
a
diminutive
but
in
every
way
respectable
flat
which
could
boast
of
a
spotless
vestibule
and
an
icy-cold
drawing-room
and
thence
again
they
migrated
to
the
country
where
they
settled
for
good
and
where
in
due
time
they
had
born
to
them
a
son
Arkady
The
existence
of
husband
and
wife
was
one
of
perfect
comfort
and
tranquillity
Almost
never
were
they
parted
from
one
another
they
read
together
they
played
the
piano
together
and
they
sang
duets
Also
she
would
garden
or
superintend
the
poultry-yard
and
he
would
set
forth
a-hunting
or
see
to
the
management
of
the
estate
Meanwhile
Arkady
led
an
existence
of
equal
calm
and
comfort
and
grew
and
waxed
fat
until
in
1847
when
ten
years
had
been
passed
in
this
idyllic
fashion
Kirsanov
's
wife
breathed
her
last
The
blow
proved
almost
more
than
the
husband
could
bear
so
much
so
that
his
head
turned
grey
in
a
few
weeks
Yet
though
he
sought
distraction
for
his
thoughts
by
going
abroad
he
felt
constrained
in
the
following
year
to
return
home
where
after
a
prolonged
period
of
inaction
he
took
up
the
subject
of
Industrial
Reform
Next
in
1855
he
sent
his
son
to
the
University
of
St
Petersburg
and
for
the
same
reason
spent
the
following
three
winters
in
the
capital
where
he
seldom
went
out
but
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
in
endeavouring
to
fraternise
with
his
son
's
youthful
acquaintances
The
fourth
winter
however
he
was
prevented
by
various
circumstances
from
spending
in
St
Petersburg
and
thus
in
the
May
of
1859
we
see
him
grey-headed
dusty
a
trifle
bent
and
wholly
middle-aged
awaiting
his
son
's
home-coming
after
the
elevation
of
the
latter
in
Nikolai
's
own
footsteps
to
the
dignity
of
a
graduate
Presently
either
a
sense
of
decency
or
more
probably
a
certain
disinclination
to
remain
immediately
under
his
master
's
eye
led
the
servant
to
withdraw
to
the
entrance
gates
and
there
to
light
a
pipe
Nikolai
Petrovitch
however
continued
sitting
with
head
bent
and
his
eyes
contemplating
the
ancient
steps
of
the
verandah
up
which
a
stout
speckled
hen
was
tap-tapping
its
way
on
a
pair
of
splayed
yellow
legs
and
thereby
causing
an
untidy
but
fastidious-looking
cat
to
regard
it
from
the
balustrade
with
marked
disapproval
Meanwhile
the
sun
beat
fiercely
down
and
from
the
darkened
interior
of
a
neighbouring
granary
came
a
smell
as
of
hot
rye
straw
Nikolai
Petrovitch
sank
into
a
reverie
My
son
Arkady
a
graduate
the
words
kept
passing
and
repassing
through
his
mind
Again
and
again
he
tried
to
think
of
something
else
but
always
the
same
thought
returned
to
him
Until
eventually
he
reverted
to
the
memory
of
his
dead
wife
Would
that
she
were
still
with
me
was
his
yearning
reflection
Presently
a
fat
blue
pigeon
alighted
upon
the
roadway
and
fell
to
taking
a
hasty
drink
from
a
pool
beside
the
well
And
almost
at
the
instant
that
the
spectacle
of
the
bird
caught
Nikolai
Petrovitch
's
eye
his
ear
caught
the
sound
of
approaching
wheels
They
are
coming
I
think
hazarded
the
servant
as
he
stepped
forward
through
the
gates
Nikolai
Petrovitch
sprang
to
his
feet
and
strained
his
eyes
along
the
road
Yes
coming
into
view
there
was
a
tarantass
4
drawn
by
three
stagehorses
and
in
the
tarantass
there
could
be
seen
the
band
of
a
student
's
cap
and
the
outlines
of
a
familiar
well-beloved
face
Arkasha
Arkasha
was
Kirsanov
's
cry
as
running
forward
he
waved
his
arms
A
few
moments
later
he
was
pressing
his
lips
to
the
sun-tanned
dusty
hairless
cheek
of
the
newly-fledged
graduate
1
Gentleman
or
squire
2
The
desiatin
2.86
acres
3
Civil
servant
4
A
species
of
four-wheeled
carriage
Yes
but
first
give
me
a
rub
down
dearest
Papa
said
Arkady
in
a
voice
which
though
a
little
hoarsened
with
travelling
was
yet
clear
and
youthful
See
I
am
covering
you
with
dust
he
added
as
joyously
he
returned
his
father
's
caresses
Oh
but
that
will
not
matter
said
Nikolai
Petrovitch
with
a
loving
reassuring
smile
as
he
gave
the
collar
of
his
son
's
blue
cloak
a
couple
of
pats
and
then
did
the
same
by
his
own
jacket
Thereafter
gently
withdrawing
from
his
son
's
embrace
and
beginning
to
lead
the
way
towards
the
inn
yard
he
added
Come
this
way
come
this
way
The
horses
will
soon
be
ready
His
excitement
seemed
even
to
outdo
his
son
's
so
much
did
he
stammer
and
stutter
and
at
times
find
himself
at
a
loss
for
a
word
Arkady
stopped
him
Papa
he
said
first
let
me
introduce
my
good
friend
Bazarov
who
is
the
comrade
whom
I
have
so
often
mentioned
in
letters
to
you
and
who
has
been
kind
enough
to
come
to
us
for
a
visit
At
once
Nikolai
Petrovitch
wheeled
round
and
approaching
a
tall
man
who
clad
in
a
long
coat
with
a
tasselled
belt
had
just
alighted
from
the
tarantass
pressed
the
bare
red
hand
which
after
a
pause
the
stranger
offered
him
I
am
indeed
glad
to
see
you
was
Nikolai
Petrovitch
's
greeting
I
am
indeed
grateful
to
you
for
your
kindness
in
paying
us
this
visit
Alas
I
hope
that
that
But
first
might
I
inquire
your
name
Evgenii
Vasiliev
replied
the
other
in
slow
but
virile
accents
as
turning
down
the
collar
of
his
coat
he
revealed
his
face
more
clearly
Long
and
thin
with
a
high
forehead
which
looked
flattened
at
the
top
and
became
sharpened
towards
the
nose
the
face
had
large
greenish
eyes
and
long
sandy
whiskers
The
instant
that
the
features
brightened
into
a
smile
however
they
betokened
self-assurance
and
intellect
My
dearest
Evgenii
Vasiliev
Nikolai
Petrovitch
continued
I
trust
that
whilst
you
are
with
us
you
will
not
find
time
hang
heavy
upon
your
hands
Bazarov
gave
his
lips
a
slight
twitch
but
vouchsafed
no
reply
beyond
raising
his
cap
a
movement
which
revealed
the
fact
that
the
prominent
convolutions
of
the
skull
were
by
no
means
concealed
by
the
superincumbent
mass
of
indeterminate-coloured
hair
Now
Arkady
went
on
Nikolai
Petrovitch
as
he
turned
to
his
son
shall
we
have
the
horses
harnessed
at
once
or
should
you
prefer
to
rest
a
little
Let
us
rest
at
home
Papa
So
pray
have
the
horses
put
to
I
will
his
father
agreed
Peter
Bestir
yourself
my
good
fellow
Being
what
is
known
as
a
perfectly
trained
servant
Peter
had
neither
approached
nor
shaken
hands
with
the
young
barin
but
contented
himself
with
a
distant
bow
He
now
vanished
through
the
yard
gates
Though
I
have
come
in
the
koliaska
said
Nikolai
Petrovitch
I
have
brought
three
fresh
horses
for
the
tarantass
Arkady
then
drank
some
water
from
a
yellow
bowl
proffered
by
the
landlord
while
Bazarov
lighted
a
pipe
and
approached
the
ostler
who
was
engaged
in
unharnessing
the
stagehorses
Only
two
can
ride
in
the
koliaska
continued
Nikolai
Petrovitch
wherefore
I
am
rather
in
a
difficulty
to
know
how
your
friend
will
Oh
he
can
travel
in
the
tarantass
interrupted
Arkady
Moreover
do
not
stand
on
any
ceremony
with
him
for
wonderful
though
he
is
he
is
also
quite
simple
as
you
will
find
for
yourself
Nikolai
Petrovitch
's
coachman
brought
out
the
horses
and
Bazarov
remarked
to
the
ostler
Come
bestir
yourself
fat-beard
Did
you
hear
that
Mitiusha
added
another
ostler
who
was
standing
with
his
hands
thrust
into
the
back
slits
of
his
blouse
The
barin
has
just
called
you
a
fat-beard
And
a
fat-beard
you
are
For
answer
Mitiusha
merely
cocked
his
cap
to
one
side
and
drew
the
reins
from
the
back
of
the
sweating
shafts-horse
Quick
now
my
good
fellows
cried
Nikolai
Petrovitch
Bear
a
hand
all
of
you
and
for
each
there
will
be
a
glassful
of
vodka
Naturally
it
was
not
long
before
the
horses
were
harnessed
and
then
father
and
son
seated
themselves
in
the
koliaska
Peter
mounted
the
box
of
that
vehicle
and
Bazarov
stepped
into
the
tarantass
and
lolled
his
head
against
the
leather
cushion
at
the
back
Finally
the
cortège
moved
away
To
think
that
you
are
now
a
graduate
and
home
again
said
Nikolai
Petrovitch
as
he
tapped
Arkady
on
the
knee
and
then
on
the
shoulder
There
now
there
now
And
how
is
Uncle
Is
he
quite
well
asked
Arkady
the
reason
for
the
question
being
that
though
he
felt
filled
with
a
genuine
an
almost
childish
delight
at
his
return
he
also
felt
conscious
of
an
instinct
that
the
conversation
were
best
diverted
from
the
emotional
to
the
prosaic
Yes
your
uncle
is
quite
well
As
a
matter
of
fact
he
also
had
arranged
to
come
and
meet
you
but
at
the
last
moment
changed
his
mind
Did
you
have
very
long
to
wait
continued
Arkady
About
five
hours
Dearest
Papa
cried
Arkady
as
leaning
over
towards
his
father
he
imprinted
upon
his
cheek
a
fervent
kiss
Nikolai
Petrovitch
smiled
quietly
I
have
got
a
splendid
horse
for
you
he
next
remarked
Presently
you
shall
see
him
Also
your
room
has
been
entirely
repapered
And
have
you
a
room
for
Bazarov
as
well
One
shall
be
found
for
him
Oh
and
pray
humour
him
in
every
way
you
can
I
could
not
express
to
you
how
much
I
value
his
friendship
But
you
have
not
known
him
very
long
have
you
No
not
very
long
I
thought
not
for
I
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
him
in
St
Petersburg
last
winter
In
what
does
he
most
interest
himself
Principally
in
natural
science
But
to
tell
the
truth
he
knows
practically
everything
and
is
to
become
a
doctor
next
year
Oh
So
he
is
in
the
Medical
Faculty
Nikolai
Petrovitch
remarked
after
which
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
Peter
went
on
Nikolai
pointing
with
his
hand
are
not
those
peasants
there
some
of
our
own
Peter
glanced
in
the
direction
indicated
and
saw
a
few
waggons
proceeding
along
a
narrow
by-road
The
teams
were
bridleless
and
in
each
waggon
were
seated
some
two
or
three
muzhiks
with
their
blouses
unbuttoned
Yes
they
are
some
of
our
own
Peter
responded
Then
whither
can
they
be
going
To
the
town
Yes
or
to
the
tavern
This
last
was
added
contemptuously
and
with
a
wink
to
the
coachman
that
was
designed
to
enlist
that
functionary's
sympathy
but
as
the
functionary
in
question
was
one
of
the
old
school
which
takes
no
share
in
the
modern
movement
he
stirred
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
This
year
my
peasants
have
been
giving
me
a
good
deal
of
trouble
Nikolai
Petrovitch
continued
to
his
son
Persistently
do
they
refuse
to
pay
their
tithes
What
ought
to
be
done
with
them
And
do
you
find
your
hired
workmen
satisfactory
Not
altogether
muttered
Nikolai
Petrovitch
You
see
they
have
become
spoilt
more
's
the
pity
Any
real
energy
seems
quite
to
have
left
them
and
they
not
only
ruin
my
implements
but
also
leave
the
land
untilled
Does
estate-management
interest
you
The
thing
we
most
lack
here
is
shade
remarked
Arkady
in
evasion
of
the
question
Ah
but
I
have
had
an
awning
added
to
the
north
balcony
so
that
we
can
take
our
meals
in
the
open
air
But
that
will
give
the
place
rather
the
look
of
a
villa
will
it
not
Things
of
that
sort
never
prove
effectual
But
oh
the
air
here
How
good
it
smells
Yes
in
my
opinion
things
never
smell
elsewhere
as
they
do
here
And
oh
the
sky
Suddenly
Arkady
stopped
threw
a
glance
of
apprehension
in
the
direction
of
the
tarantass
and
relapsed
into
silence
I
quite
agree
with
you
replied
Nikolai
Petrovitch
You
see
the
reason
is
that
you
were
born
here
and
that
therefore
the
place
is
bound
to
have
for
you
a
special
significance
But
no
significance
can
attach
to
the
place
of
a
man
's
birth
Papa
Indeed
Oh
no
None
whatsoever
Nikolai
Petrovitch
glanced
at
the
speaker
and
for
fully
half
a
verst
let
the
vehicle
proceed
without
the
conversation
between
them
being
renewed
At
length
Nikolai
Petrovitch
observed
I
can
not
remember
whether
I
wrote
to
tell
you
that
your
old
nurse
Egorovna
is
dead
Dead
Oh
the
poor
old
woman
But
Prokofitch
is
he
still
alive
He
is
so
and
in
no
way
changed
that
is
to
say
he
grumbles
as
much
as
ever
In
fact
you
will
find
that
no
really
important
alterations
have
taken
place
at
Marino
And
have
you
the
same
steward
as
before
No
I
have
appointed
a
fresh
one
for
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
I
could
not
have
any
freed
serfs
about
the
place
That
is
to
say
I
did
not
feel
as
though
I
could
trust
such
fellows
with
posts
of
responsibility
Arkady
indicated
Peter
with
his
eyes
and
Nikolai
Petrovitch
therefore
subdued
his
voice
a
little
He
Oh
il
est
libre
en
effet
You
see
he
is
my
valet
But
as
regards
a
steward
I
have
appointed
a
miestchanin
1
at
a
salary
of
250
roubles
a
year
and
he
seems
at
least
capable
But
and
here
Nikolai
Petrovitch
rubbed
his
forehead
which
gesture
with
him
always
implied
inward
agitation
I
ought
to
say
that
though
I
have
told
you
that
you
will
find
no
alterations
of
importance
at
Marino
the
statement
is
not
strictly
true
seeing
that
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
that
Nikolai
Petrovitch
hesitated
again
then
added
in
French
Perhaps
by
a
stern
moralist
my
frankness
might
be
considered
misplaced
yet
I
will
not
conceal
from
you
nor
can
you
fail
to
be
aware
that
always
I
have
had
ideas
of
my
own
on
the
subject
of
the
relations
which
ought
to
subsist
between
a
father
and
his
son
At
the
same
time
this
is
not
to
say
that
you
have
not
the
right
to
judge
me
Rather
it
is
that
at
my
age
Well
to
put
matters
bluntly
the
girl
whom
you
will
have
heard
me
speak
of
You
mean
Thenichka
said
Arkady
Nikolai
Petrovitch
's
face
went
red
Do
not
speak
of
her
so
loudly
he
advised
Yes
she
is
living
with
us
I
took
her
in
because
two
of
our
smaller
rooms
were
available
But
of
course
the
arrangement
must
be
changed
Why
must
it
Papa
Because
this
friend
of
yours
is
coming
and
also
because
well
it
might
make
things
awkward
Do
not
disturb
yourself
on
Bazarov
's
account
He
is
altogether
superior
to
such
things
Yes
so
you
say
but
the
mischief
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
wing
is
so
small
Papa
Papa
protested
Arkady
Almost
one
would
think
that
you
considered
yourself
to
blame
for
something
whereas
you
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
with
Ah
but
I
have
responded
Nikolai
Petrovitch
His
face
had
turned
redder
than
ever
No
you
have
not
Papa
repeated
Arkady
with
a
loving
smile
while
adding
to
himself
with
a
feeling
of
indulgent
tenderness
for
his
good
kind
father
as
well
as
with
a
certain
sense
of
superiority
Why
is
he
making
these
excuses
I
beg
of
you
to
say
no
more
he
continued
with
an
involuntary
feeling
of
exultation
in
being
grown
up
and
emancipated
As
he
did
so
Nikolai
Petrovitch
glanced
at
him
from
under
the
fingers
of
the
hand
which
was
still
rubbing
his
brows
At
the
same
moment
something
seemed
to
give
his
heart
a
stab
Mentally
as
before
he
blamed
himself
Here
our
fields
begin
he
observed
after
a
pause
I
see
rejoined
Arkady
And
that
is
our
forest
in
front
I
suppose
It
is
so
Only
only
I
have
sold
it
and
this
year
it
is
to
be
removed
Why
have
you
sold
it
Because
I
needed
the
money
Moreover
the
land
which
it
occupies
must
go
to
the
peasants
What
To
the
peasants
who
pay
you
no
tithes
Possibly
But
some
day
they
will
pay
me
I
regret
the
forest
's
loss
said
Arkady
and
then
resumed
his
contemplation
of
the
landscape
The
scenery
which
the
party
were
traversing
could
not
have
been
called
picturesque
for
with
slight
undulations
only
fields
fields
and
again
fields
stretched
to
the
very
horizon
True
a
few
patches
of
copse
were
visible
but
the
ditches
with
their
borderings
of
low
sparse
brushwood
recalled
the
antique
land-measurement
of
Katherine's
day
Also
streams
ran
pent
between
abruptly
sloping
banks
hamlets
with
dwarfed
huts
of
which
the
blackened
roofs
were
for
the
most
part
cracked
in
half
stood
cheek
by
jowl
with
crazy
grinding-byres
of
plaited
willow
empty
threshing-floors
had
their
gates
sagging
and
from
churches
of
wood
or
of
brick
which
stood
amid
dilapidated
graveyards
the
stucco
was
peeling
and
the
crosses
were
threatening
at
any
moment
to
fall
As
he
gazed
at
the
scene
Arkady
's
heart
contracted
Moreover
the
peasants
encountered
on
the
road
looked
ragged
and
were
riding
sorry
nags
while
the
laburnum
trees
which
stood
ranged
like
miserable
beggars
by
the
roadside
had
their
bark
hanging
in
strips
and
their
boughs
shattered
Lastly
the
lean
mud-encrusted
cows
which
could
be
seen
hungrily
cropping
the
herbage
in
the
ditches
were
so
staring
of
coat
that
the
animals
might
just
have
been
rescued
from
the
talons
of
some
terrible
death-dealing
monster
and
as
one
gazed
at
those
weak
pitiful
beasts
almost
one
could
fancy
that
one
saw
uprisen
from
amid
the
beauty
of
spring
the
pale
phantoms
of
Winter
its
storms
and
its
frost
and
its
snow
Evidently
this
is
not
a
rich
district
reflected
Arkady
Rather
it
is
a
district
which
gives
one
the
impression
neither
of
abundance
nor
of
hard
work
Yet
can
it
be
left
as
it
is
No
Education
is
what
we
need
But
how
is
that
education
to
be
administered
or
for
that
matter
to
be
introduced
Thus
Arkady
Yet
even
as
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
Spring
seemed
once
more
to
regain
possession
of
her
kingdom
and
everything
around
him
grew
golden-green
and
trees
shrubs
and
herbage
started
to
wave
and
glimmer
under
the
soft
warm
breath
of
the
vernal
zephyrs
and
larks
took
to
pouring
out
their
souls
in
endless
ringing
strains
and
siskins
circling
high
over
sunken
ponds
uttered
their
cry
then
skimmed
the
hillocks
in
silence
and
handsome
black
rooks
stalked
among
the
tender
green
of
the
short
corn-shoots
or
settled
among
the
pale-white
smokelike
ripples
of
the
young
rye
whence
at
intervals
they
protruded
their
heads
Arkady
gazed
and
gazed
and
gradually
as
he
did
so
his
late
thoughts
grew
dimmer
and
disappeared
and
throwing
off
his
travelling-cloak
he
peered
so
joyously
with
such
a
boyish
air
into
his
father
's
face
that
Nikolai
Petrovitch
bestowed
upon
him
yet
another
embrace
We
have
but
little
further
to
go
now
he
remarked
In
fact
when
once
we
have
topped
that
rise
the
house
will
come
into
view
And
what
a
time
we
are
going
to
have
together
Arkasha
For
you
will
be
able
to
help
me
with
the
estate
if
you
care
to
that
is
to
say
and
you
and
I
will
draw
nearer
to
one
another
and
make
one
another
's
better
acquaintance
We
will
cried
Arkady
And
what
splendid
weather
for
us
both
Yes
specially
for
your
home-coming
is
spring
in
all
its
glory
Yet
I
am
not
sure
that
I
do
not
agree
with
Pushkin
where
he
says
in
Eugène
Onegin
How
sad
to
me
is
your
coming
O
spring
spring
season
of
love
Arkady
shouted
Bazarov
from
the
tarantass
please
send
me
a
match
or
two
for
I
have
nothing
to
light
my
pipe
with
Instantly
Nikolai
Petrovitch
ceased
quoting
poetry
and
Arkady
who
had
listened
with
considerable
surprise
though
also
with
a
certain
measure
of
sympathy
to
his
father
hastened
to
produce
from
his
pocket
a
silver
matchbox
and
to
dispatch
the
same
by
the
hand
of
Peter
In
return
would
you
care
to
have
a
cigar
called
Bazarov
I
should
replied
Arkady
The
result
was
that
when
Peter
returned
to
the
koliaska
he
handed
Arkady
not
only
the
matchbox
but
also
a
fat
black
cigar
This
Arkady
lit
at
leisure
and
then
proceeded
to
diffuse
around
him
so
strong
and
acrid
an
odour
of
tobacco
that
Nikolai
Petrovitch
a
non-smoker
from
birth
found
himself
forced
to
avert
his
nose
though
he
did
this
covertly
for
fear
of
offending
his
son
A
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
vehicles
drew
up
at
the
steps
of
a
new
wooden
mansion
painted
grey
and
roofed
with
red
sheet-iron
The
mansion
was
Marino
or
Novaia
Sloboda
or
to
quote
the
peasants
name
Bobili
Chutor
1
A
member
of
the
trading
or
shopkeeping
class
There
issued
on
to
the
verandah
to
greet
the
arrivals
no
throng
of
household
serfs
only
a
solitary
girl
of
twelve
Presently
however
she
was
joined
by
a
young
fellow
much
resembling
Peter
but
dressed
in
a
grey
livery
coat
to
which
embossed
silver-gilt
buttons
were
attached
This
was
Paul
Kirsanov
's
valet
In
silence
he
opened
the
door
of
the
koliaska
and
unhooked
the
apron
of
the
tarantass
whereupon
the
three
gentlemen
alighted
passed
through
a
dark
bare
hall
the
face
of
a
young
woman
peered
at
them
for
a
moment
from
behind
a
door
and
entered
a
drawing-room
upholstered
in
the
latest
fashion
So
here
we
are
at
home
again
exclaimed
Nikolai
Petrovitch
taking
off
his
cap
and
shaking
back
his
hair
Let
us
have
supper
and
then
for
bed
bed
Yes
something
to
eat
would
undoubtedly
be
welcome
remarked
Bazarov
as
yawning
he
seated
himself
upon
a
sofa
Quite
so
I
will
have
supper
served
at
once
Nikolai
Petrovitch
for
no
apparent
reason
tripped
over
his
own
feet
And
here
comes
Prokofitch
he
added
As
he
spoke
entered
a
man
of
about
sixty
who
white-haired
and
of
thin
swarthy
features
was
wearing
a
cinnamon-coloured
tail-coat
with
brass
buttons
and
a
crimson
collar
He
smiled
with
delight
as
he
approached
and
shook
hands
with
Arkady
Then
with
a
bow
to
the
guest
he
retired
to
the
doorway
and
folded
his
hands
behind
his
back
So
here
is
the
young
master
Prokofitch
said
Nikolai
Petrovitch
He
is
home
at
last
And
how
think
you
is
he
looking
Very
well
very
well
the
old
man
said
with
another
smile
The
next
moment
however
he
knit
his
shaggy
brows
and
suggested
Shall
I
lay
the
table
If
you
please
if
you
please
Nikolai
Petrovitch
turned
to
Bazarov
Before
supper
he
said
would
you
care
to
go
to
your
room
I
thank
you
no
But
please
have
my
trunk
conveyed
thither
and
also
this
wrap
And
Bazarov
divested
himself
of
his
cloak
Certainly
Prokofitch
take
the
gentleman
's
cloak
The
old
butler
received
the
garment
gingerly
held
it
well
away
from
him
with
both
hands
and
left
the
room
on
tiptoe
And
you
Arkady
continued
Nikolai
Petrovitch
Do
you
not
wish
to
go
to
your
room
Yes
for
a
wash
I
should
be
thankful
was
Arkady
's
reply
as
he
moved
towards
the
door
At
that
moment
it
opened
to
admit
a
man
of
medium
height
who
was
dressed
in
a
dark
English
suit
a
fashionably
low
collar
and
a
pair
of
patent
leather
boots
This
was
Paul
Petrovitch
Kirsanov
Although
forty-five
he
had
close-cropped
grey
hair
of
the
sheen
of
new
silver
and
his
sallow
unwrinkled
face
was
as
clear-cut
and
regular
of
outline
as
though
carved
with
a
light
fine
chisel
Still
retaining
traces
of
remarkable
comeliness
his
bright
black
oblong
eyes
had
a
peculiar
attraction
and
his
every
well-bred
refined
feature
showed
that
symmetry
of
youth
that
air
of
superiority
to
the
rest
of
the
world
which
usually
disappears
when
once
the
twenties
have
been
passed
Drawing
from
his
trouser
pocket
a
slender
hand
the
long
pink
nails
of
which
looked
all
the
slenderer
for
the
snowy
whiteness
of
the
superimposed
cuff
and
large
opal
sleeve-link
he
offered
it
to
his
nephew
after
which
this
prefatory
European
handshake
over
he
thrice
kissed
Arkady
in
the
Russian
fashion
that
is
to
say
touched
his
nephew
's
cheek
with
his
perfumed
moustache
and
murmured
I
congratulate
you
Next
Nikolai
Petrovitch
presented
to
him
Bazarov
Inclining
his
supple
figure
with
a
faint
smile
Paul
Petrovitch
this
time
did
not
offer
his
hand
On
the
contrary
he
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
I
was
beginning
to
think
that
you
never
meant
to
arrive
he
said
with
an
amiable
hoist
of
his
shoulders
and
a
display
of
some
beautiful
white
teeth
What
happened
to
you
Nothing
replied
Arkady
except
that
we
lingered
a
little
For
the
same
reason
are
we
as
hungry
as
wolves
so
pray
tell
Prokofitch
to
be
quick
Papa
and
I
shall
be
back
in
a
moment
Wait
I
will
go
with
you
added
Bazarov
as
he
rose
from
the
sofa
and
the
two
young
men
left
the
room
together
Who
is
your
guest
asked
Paul
Petrovitch
A
friend
of
Arkady
's
and
according
to
Arkady
's
showing
a
man
of
intellect
He
is
going
to
stay
here
He
is
A
long-haired
fellow
like
that
Certainly
In
that
particular
direction
Paul
Petrovitch
said
no
more
but
tapping
the
table
with
his
finger-nails
added
Je
pense
que
notre
Arkady
s'est
dégourdi
1
And
in
any
case
I
am
pleased
to
see
him
back
again
At
supper
little
was
said
In
particular
did
Bazarov
scarcely
speak
though
he
ate
heartily
and
only
Nikolai
Petrovitch
proved
garrulous
as
he
related
various
incidents
in
what
he
termed
his
agricultural
life
and
gossiped
of
forthcoming
administrative
measures
committees
deputations
the
need
of
introducing
machinery
and
other
such
topics
For
his
part
Paul
Petrovitch
paced
the
room
he
never
took
supper
and
sipped
a
glassful
of
red
wine
and
occasionally
interjected
some
such
remark
rather
exclamation
as
Ah
or
Oh
ho
or
H
'm
Arkady
's
contribution
consisted
of
a
little
St
Petersburg
gossip
even
though
throughout
he
was
conscious
of
a
touch
of
that
awkwardness
which
overtakes
a
young
man
when
just
ceased
to
be
a
boy
he
returns
to
the
spot
where
hitherto
he
has
ranked
as
a
mere
child
In
other
words
he
drawled
his
phrases
unnecessarily
carefully
avoided
the
use
of
the
term
Papasha
2
and
once
even
went
so
far
as
to
substitute
for
it
the
term
Otety
3
though
true
he
pronounced
it
with
some
difficulty
Lastly
in
his
excessive
desire
to
seem
at
his
ease
he
helped
himself
to
more
wine
than
was
good
for
him
and
tasted
some
of
every
brand
Meanwhile
Prokofitch
chewed
his
lips
and
never
removed
his
eyes
from
his
young
master
Supper
over
the
company
dispersed
A
queer
fellow
is
that
uncle
of
yours
Bazarov
said
to
Arkady
as
clad
in
a
dressing-gown
he
seated
himself
by
his
friend
's
bed
and
sucked
at
a
short
pipe
To
think
of
encountering
such
elegance
in
the
country
He
would
take
a
prize
with
his
finger-nails
You
do
not
know
him
yet
said
Arkady
In
his
day
he
was
a
leading
lion
and
some
time
or
another
I
will
tell
you
his
history
Yes
many
and
many
a
woman
has
lost
her
head
over
his
good
looks
Then
I
should
think
that
he
has
nothing
to
live
on
save
memories
observed
Bazarov
At
all
events
there
is
no
one
here
for
him
to
enslave
I
looked
him
over
to-night
and
never
in
my
life
have
beheld
a
collar
of
such
marvellous
gloss
or
a
chin
so
perfectly
shaven
Yet
such
things
can
come
to
look
ridiculous
do
not
you
think
Yes
perhaps
they
can
But
he
is
such
an
excellent
fellow
in
himself
Oh
certainly
a
truly
archangelic
personage
Your
father
too
is
excellent
for
though
he
may
read
foolish
poetry
and
though
his
ideas
on
the
subject
of
industry
may
be
few
his
heart
is
in
the
right
place
He
is
a
man
with
a
