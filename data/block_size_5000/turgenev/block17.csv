trotting
and
though
the
pair
were
overshadowed
by
the
trees
the
rider
was
as
clearly
visible
even
to
a
patch
on
his
shoulder
as
the
twinkling
legs
of
his
steed
Piercing
the
tangled
aspens
the
sun
's
beams
were
bathing
the
trunks
in
so
brilliant
a
glow
that
trunks
and
beams
were
one
bright
mass
and
only
the
foliage
on
the
boughs
above
formed
a
dusky
blur
against
the
lighter
tints
of
the
flame-coloured
sky
Overhead
bats
were
whirling
the
wind
had
sunk
to
rest
a
few
late-homing
bees
were
buzzing
somnolently
sluggishly
amid
the
lilac
blossoms
and
a
pillared
swarm
of
gnats
was
dancing
over
a
projecting
bough
O
God
how
fair
was
Nikolai
's
involuntary
thought
as
his
lips
breathed
a
favourite
couplet
Suddenly
he
remembered
Arkady
and
Stoff
und
Kraft
and
though
he
continued
to
sit
where
he
was
he
quoted
poetry
no
more
but
surrendered
his
mind
wholly
to
the
play
of
his
lonely
irregular
mournful
thoughts
At
all
times
he
was
a
man
fond
of
dreaming
and
to
this
tendency
his
life
in
the
country
had
added
confirmation
To
think
of
what
only
a
short
while
ago
he
had
been
dreaming
as
he
waited
for
his
son
on
the
post-house
verandah
For
since
that
hour
a
change
had
come
about
and
in
the
vague
relations
between
himself
and
his
son
there
had
dawned
a
more
definite
phase
Next
he
saw
before
him
his
dead
wife
Yet
he
saw
her
not
as
she
had
appeared
to
him
during
the
later
years
of
her
life
that
is
to
say
as
a
kindly
thrifty
châtelaine
but
as
a
young
girl
slim
of
figure
and
innocently
inquiring
of
eye
Yes
there
flitted
before
his
vision
a
picture
only
of
neatly
plaited
tresses
falling
over
a
childish
neck
And
he
thought
of
his
first
meeting
with
her
when
as
a
student
he
had
encountered
her
on
the
staircase
leading
to
his
suite
of
rooms
He
remembered
how
having
accidentally
brushed
against
her
he
had
stopped
to
apologise
but
had
only
succeeded
in
muttering
Pardon
monsieur
where-upon
she
had
bowed
and
smiled
and
fled
as
in
sudden
alarm
but
only
to
turn
the
next
moment
at
the
bend
of
the
staircase
to
look
swiftly
back
and
then
as
swiftly
to
blush
and
assume
a
more
demure
demeanour
Ah
those
first
timid
meetings
those
half-spoken
words
those
bashful
smiles
those
alternate
fits
of
rapture
and
despair
that
courtship
that
was
destined
to
be
crowned
with
swooning
joy
Whither
was
it
all
fled
True
she
had
become
his
wife
and
had
conferred
upon
him
such
happiness
as
falls
to
the
lot
of
few
men
on
earth
but
ever
the
thought
recurred
to
him
and
recurred
again
Why
could
those
days
of
sweetness
not
have
lasted
for
ever
so
that
we
might
have
lived
a
life
which
should
never
have
known
death
He
made
no
attempt
to
co-ordinate
his
thoughts
The
predominant
feeling
in
his
mind
was
that
he
would
give
worlds
to
be
able
to
connect
himself
with
those
blessed
days
by
something
stronger
than
the
mere
power
of
memory
He
wanted
to
feel
his
Maria
near
him
once
more
to
scent
her
dear
breath
A
curious
mood
had
him
in
its
grip
Nikolai
Petrovitch
came
the
voice
of
Thenichka
from
a
spot
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
Where
are
you
As
he
heard
the
call
a
feeling
that
was
neither
vexation
nor
shame
passed
over
him
No
comparison
between
his
dead
wife
and
Thenichka
was
possible
yet
he
gave
a
start
and
felt
a
passing
regret
that
Thenichka
had
seized
that
moment
to
seek
him
For
in
some
way
did
the
sound
of
her
voice
bring
back
to
him
his
grey
hairs
his
old
age
all
that
constituted
the
present
So
for
an
instant
the
enchanted
world
which
he
had
just
entered
and
which
he
had
just
seen
emerge
from
the
misty
waves
of
the
past
quivered
then
disappeared
I
am
here
Thenichka
he
called
Please
go
away
I
will
come
presently
Another
reminder
that
I
am
a
barin
he
reflected
Thenichka
retired
and
suddenly
he
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
since
the
moment
when
he
had
sunk
into
a
reverie
nightfall
had
come
Yes
all
around
him
there
lay
a
motionless
obscurity
with
gleaming
amid
it
as
a
small
pale
blur
Thenichka
's
face
Rising
he
started
to
return
to
the
house
but
his
unstrung
nerves
could
not
calm
themselves
and
glancing
now
at
the
ground
now
towards
the
heavens
where
there
swarmed
myriads
of
twinkling
stars
he
fell
to
pacing
the
garden
He
continued
this
pacing
until
he
was
almost
worn
out
for
still
did
the
vague
despondent
insistent
sense
of
agitation
refuse
to
leave
his
breast
Could
Bazarov
have
divined
his
thoughts
how
the
Nihilist
would
have
laughed
And
even
Arkady
would
have
condemned
him
For
from
the
eyes
of
Nikolai
Petrovitch
from
the
eyes
of
a
man
of
forty-four
who
was
the
proprietor
of
an
estate
and
a
household
there
were
welling
slow
uncalled-for
tears
This
was
a
hundred
times
worse
than
the
'cello-playing
And
still
he
continued
his
pacing
for
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
enter
the
peaceful
inviting
retreat
which
beckoned
to
him
so
cheerfully
with
its
lighted
windows
and
to
leave
the
darkness
of
the
garden
to
forego
the
touch
of
fresh
air
upon
his
face
to
throw
off
his
present
mood
of
sadness
and
emotion
At
a
turn
in
the
path
he
encountered
Paul
Petrovitch
What
is
the
matter
with
you
Paul
inquired
You
are
looking
as
white
as
a
ghost
Are
you
ill
Why
not
go
to
bed
Nikolai
Petrovitch
explained
to
him
in
a
few
words
his
frame
of
mind
then
moved
towards
the
house
Paul
Petrovitch
sauntered
down
towards
the
other
end
of
the
garden
and
ever
and
anon
as
he
did
so
indulged
in
wrapt
contemplation
of
the
heavens
Yet
save
for
the
reflection
of
the
starlight
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
in
his
dark
handsome
eyes
for
he
had
not
been
born
a
Romanticist
and
his
drily
fastidious
passionate
Frenchified
misanthropic
soul
was
incapable
of
castle-building
I
tell
you
what
Bazarov
said
to
Arkady
the
same
night
A
splendid
idea
has
come
into
my
head
You
know
that
to-day
your
father
said
that
a
certain
eminent
relation
had
sent
him
an
invitation
which
he
had
no
intention
of
accepting
Well
how
would
it
be
if
you
and
I
were
to
accept
it
seeing
that
you
too
have
been
included
in
the
honour
The
weather
has
turned
beautiful
and
we
might
drive
over
and
look
at
the
town
and
thus
incidentally
secure
a
few
days
uninterrupted
talk
together
Should
you
then
return
here
No
I
should
go
on
to
my
father
's
You
see
he
lives
thirty
versts
away
only
and
it
is
a
long
time
since
last
I
saw
either
him
or
my
mother
Moreover
the
old
folk
deserve
to
be
humoured
a
little
seeing
that
they
have
been
very
good
to
me
especially
my
father
and
that
I
am
their
only
son
And
shall
you
stay
long
No
Staying
in
that
place
is
dull
work
Then
pay
us
a
second
visit
on
your
way
back
I
will
if
possible
We
will
go
then
eh
At
your
pleasure
Arkady
replied
with
a
show
of
indifference
But
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
delighted
with
Bazarov
's
proposal
and
only
the
thought
that
he
must
keep
up
his
Nihilism
prevented
him
from
manifesting
his
feelings
So
the
next
day
the
pair
set
out
for
the
town
of
while
with
one
consent
the
youth
of
Marino
broke
into
lamentations
over
their
going
and
Duniasha
even
went
so
far
as
to
weep
Only
their
elders
breathed
more
freely
The
town
of
whither
our
friends
now
proceeded
lay
under
the
dominion
of
one
of
those
young
progressive
despotic
provincial
governors
who
afflict
Russia
in
an
unending
sequence
As
early
as
the
first
year
of
his
rule
this
particular
potentate
had
succeeded
in
quarrelling
not
only
with
the
President
of
the
Provincial
Council
who
was
a
retired
staff
officer
a
horse
breeder
and
an
agriculturist
but
also
with
his
whole
gubernatorial
staff
of
tchinovniks
with
the
result
that
at
the
time
of
our
story
the
commotion
therefrom
had
attained
a
pitch
which
had
just
necessitated
the
sending
down
of
a
commissary
empowered
to
hold
an
investigation
The
Government's
choice
for
this
purpose
had
fallen
upon
Matvei
Ilyitch
Koliazin
the
son
of
the
Koliazin
who
had
once
acted
as
guardian
to
the
brothers
Kirsanov
and
a
man
of
the
younger
school
that
is
to
say
a
man
who
though
a
little
over
forty
still
aimed
at
attaining
the
dignity
of
a
statesman
and
having
a
breast
covered
with
stars
including
at
least
one
of
a
foreign
minor
order
and
who
also
like
the
Governor
whom
he
had
come
to
examine
was
accounted
a
Progressive
and
held
a
high
opinion
of
himself
Yet
never
did
Matvei
allow
his
boundless
vanity
to
prevent
him
from
affecting
a
stereotyped
air
of
simplicity
and
good
humour
or
from
listening
indulgently
to
anything
that
might
be
said
to
him
or
from
cultivating
so
pleasant
a
laugh
that
everywhere
he
contrived
to
pass
for
not
a
bad
sort
of
a
fellow
True
he
could
on
important
occasions
if
I
may
quote
the
trite
saying
make
dust
fly
Energy
is
indispensable
for
a
State
worker
was
a
frequent
saw
of
his
L'énergie
est
la
première
qualité
d'un
homme
d'état
yet
almost
invariably
did
he
end
by
being
set
down
as
a
fool
while
tchinovniks
of
more
experience
rode
roughshod
over
him
Amongst
other
things
he
had
a
custom
of
expressing
a
great
respect
for
Guizot
1
and
also
of
striving
to
convince
every
one
that
he
Koliazin
was
not
one
of
your
men
of
routine
your
retired
bureaucrats
but
rather
a
man
who
noted
every
new
and
more
important
phenomenon
of
our
social
life
In
fact
such
phrases
he
had
at
his
finger
ends
and
also
he
studied
though
with
a
sort
of
careless
pomposity
only
the
development
of
contemporary
literature
Lastly
it
not
seldom
befell
that
on
meeting
a
street
procession
of
students
he
would
though
maturer
of
years
than
the
majority
of
its
members
add
himself
to
its
ranks
In
short
only
his
circumstances
and
his
epoch
caused
Matvei
Ilyitch
in
any
way
to
differ
from
those
officials
of
the
Alexandrine
period
who
before
setting
out
to
attend
a
reception
at
Madame
Svietchin
's
2
then
resident
in
St
Petersburg
would
read
a
few
pages
of
Condillac
's
3
works
Yet
though
an
adroit
courtier
Matvei
was
a
mere
glittering
fraud
since
save
that
he
knew
how
to
hold
his
own
against
all
comers
though
certainly
that
is
a
great
achievement
in
life
he
was
in
all
matters
of
State
a
complete
stranger
to
common
sense
On
the
present
occasion
he
welcomed
Arkady
with
all
the
bonhomie
all
the
jocosity
of
an
enlightened
bigwig
Nevertheless
his
face
fell
a
little
when
he
learned
that
the
other
relatives
whom
he
had
invited
had
preferred
remaining
in
the
country
Your
father
always
was
a
queer
fish
he
remarked
as
he
parted
the
tails
of
a
velvet
cutaway
And
having
said
this
he
turned
to
a
young
tchinovnik
in
a
tightly
buttoned
uniform
and
asked
him
irritably
what
he
wanted
at
which
onslaught
the
young
tchinovnik
whose
lips
looked
as
though
a
confirmed
habit
of
keeping
their
own
counsel
had
gummed
them
permanently
together
straightened
himself
with
a
sharp
apprehensive
look
at
his
superior
But
once
Matvei
had
effected
this
settling
of
his
subordinate
the
great
man
paid
the
little
one
no
further
attention
In
passing
I
may
observe
that
to
most
of
our
bigwigs
is
this
species
of
settling
very
dear
and
that
many
are
the
expedients
resorted
to
for
its
achievement
Particularly
is
the
following
method
quite
a
favourite
as
the
English
say
in
other
words
much
in
request
Suddenly
a
given
bigwig
will
cease
to
be
able
to
grasp
with
his
intelligence
even
the
simplest
sentence
and
assume
an
air
of
abysmal
density
For
example
he
will
inquire
what
the
day
of
the
week
may
be
and
be
told
with
great
and
stammering
deference
that
the
day
is
say
Friday
What
will
roar
the
bigwig
with
an
air
of
being
forced
to
strain
his
ears
to
the
utmost
Eh
what
do
you
say
I-It
is
F-Friday
your
E-E-Excellency
Eh
what
Friday
What
mean
you
by
Friday
Y-Your
Excellency
F-Friday
is
is
F-F-Friday
is
a
day
in
the
week
Come
come
You
need
not
have
taken
so
much
time
to
tell
me
that
Matvei
Ilyitch
was
just
such
a
bigwig
although
he
called
himself
a
Liberal
My
good
fellow
he
now
continued
to
Arkady
I
should
advise
you
to
go
and
leave
your
card
upon
the
Governor
Of
course
you
understand
that
my
reason
for
counselling
you
to
adopt
this
procedure
is
not
that
I
in
any
way
hold
with
any
bygone
ideas
about
kow-towing
to
authority
but
rather
because
the
Governor
is
a
good
fellow
and
I
know
that
you
would
like
to
see
a
little
society
For
you
too
are
not
a
bear
I
hope
No
Well
the
Governor
is
giving
a
grand
ball
the
day
after
to-morrow
And
shall
you
be
there
asked
Arkady
I
shall
of
course
receive
tickets
for
it
replied
Matvei
Ilyitch
with
an
assumed
air
of
regret
You
dance
I
presume
I
do
though
very
badly
Never
mind
never
mind
There
exists
here
plenty
of
good
society
and
it
would
never
do
for
a
young
fellow
like
yourself
to
be
a
non-dancer
Again
I
say
this
not
because
I
in
any
way
revere
antiquated
notions
nor
yet
because
I
think
that
intellect
ought
to
go
kicking
its
heels
about
but
because
Byronism
has
become
absurd
il
a
fait
son
temps
But
I
belong
to
neither
the
Byronists
nor
Well
well
I
will
introduce
you
to
some
of
our
ladies
I
myself
will
take
you
under
my
wing
And
Matvei
Ilyitch
smiled
in
a
self-satisfied
way
In
fact
you
shall
have
a
gay
time
here
At
this
point
a
servant
entered
to
announce
the
President
of
the
Provincial
Treasury
The
latter
a
mild-eyed
veteran
with
wrinkles
around
his
lips
and
a
great
love
for
nature
was
accustomed
to
remark
on
summer
days
that
of
every
little
flower
each
little
bee
is
now
taking
its
toll
So
Arkady
seized
the
occasion
to
depart
He
found
Bazarov
at
the
hotel
where
the
pair
were
putting
up
and
had
great
difficulty
in
persuading
him
to
join
in
the
projected
call
upon
the
Governor
Well
well
eventually
said
Bazarov
I
have
laid
a
hand
upon
the
tow-rope
so
it
ill
becomes
me
to
complain
of
its
weight
As
we
are
here
to
inspect
the
local
lions
let
us
inspect
them
To
the
young
men
the
Governor
accorded
a
civil
enough
welcome
but
neither
bade
them
be
seated
nor
set
the
example
himself
A
man
in
a
perpetual
hurry
and
ferment
he
on
rising
in
the
morning
was
accustomed
to
don
a
tight
uniform
and
stiff
collar
and
then
to
give
himself
up
to
such
an
orgy
of
orders-giving
that
he
never
finished
a
single
meal
As
the
result
he
was
known
throughout
the
province
as
Bardeloue
in
reference
be
it
said
not
to
the
great
French
preacher
4
but
to
burda
fermented
liquor
After
inviting
Arkady
and
Bazarov
to
the
coming
ball
the
Governor
two
minutes
later
repeated
the
invitation
as
though
he
had
never
given
it
while
likewise
he
mistook
the
pair
for
brothers
and
addressed
them
throughout
as
the
Messieurs
Kaiserov
Subsequently
as
the
pair
were
proceeding
homewards
a
man
of
small
stature
and
dressed
in
a
Slavophil
costume
leapt
from
a
passing
drozhki
and
with
a
cry
of
Evgenii
Vasilitch
flung
himself
upon
Bazarov
Is
that
you
Herr
Sitnikov
remarked
Bazarov
without
even
checking
his
stride
What
chance
brings
you
hither
A
pure
accident
was
the
other
's
reply
as
turning
to
the
drozhki
he
signed
to
the
coachman
to
follow
at
a
foot
's
pace
You
see
I
had
business
to
do
with
my
father
and
he
invited
me
to
pay
him
a
visit
Sitnikov
hopped
across
a
puddle
Also
on
learning
of
your
arrival
I
have
been
to
call
at
your
place
True
enough
on
subsequently
reaching
the
hotel
the
two
friends
found
awaiting
them
Sitnikov's
visiting-card
with
the
corners
turned
down
and
one
side
of
it
inscribed
with
his
name
in
the
French
fashion
and
the
other
with
his
name
in
Slavonic
characters
You
are
from
the
Governor
's
I
suppose
continued
the
little
man
I
sincerely
hope
not
however
Your
hopes
are
vain
Then
I
too
alas
must
pay
him
my
devoirs
But
first
introduce
me
to
your
friend
Sitnikov
Kirsanov
responded
Bazarov
without
halting
Delighted
minced
Sitnikov
as
he
stepped
back
struck
an
attitude
and
hurriedly
doffed
his
super-elegant
gloves
I
have
heard
much
of
you
Monsieur
Kirsanov
I
too
am
an
old
acquaintance
I
might
even
say
an
old
pupil
of
Evgenii
Vasilitch
's
Through
him
it
was
that
I
came
by
my
spiritual
regeneration
Arkady
glanced
at
Bazarov
's
old
pupil
and
saw
that
he
had
small
dull
pleasant
nervous
features
also
that
his
narrow
sunken
eyes
expressed
a
great
restlessness
and
that
his
lips
were
parted
in
a
perpetual
smile
of
a
wooden
and
ingratiating
order
Do
you
know
Sitnikov
continued
when
Evgenii
Vasilitch
first
told
me
that
we
ought
to
ignore
every
species
of
authority
I
experienced
a
sense
of
rapture
I
felt
as
though
I
had
suddenly
ripened
'Ah
I
thought
'at
last
have
I
found
my
man
By
the
way
Evgenii
Vasilitch
you
must
come
and
see
a
certain
lady
of
my
acquaintance
one
who
beyond
all
others
is
the
person
to
understand
you
and
to
look
upon
your
coming
as
a
red-letter
event
Perhaps
you
have
heard
of
her
already
No
Who
is
she
asked
Bazarov
reluctantly
A
Madame
Kukshin
a
Madame
I
should
say
Evdoksia
Kukshin
And
she
is
not
merely
a
remarkable
character
and
a
woman
of
light
and
leading
she
is
also
representative
of
the
émancipée
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
But
look
here
How
would
it
be
if
all
three
of
us
were
to
go
and
see
her
She
lives
only
two
steps
away
and
she
would
give
us
luncheon
You
have
not
lunched
already
I
presume
No
we
have
not
Then
the
arrangement
would
suit
us
all
By
the
way
she
is
independent
but
a
married
woman
Good-looking
queried
Bazarov
N-No
one
could
not
exactly
say
that
Then
why
ask
us
to
go
and
see
her
Ah
ha
You
will
have
your
jest
I
see
But
remember
that
she
will
stand
us
a
bottle
of
champagne
The
practicality
of
the
man
Sitnikov
gave
a
shrill
giggle
Shall
we
go
he
added
I
can
not
decide
Here
Arkady
put
in
a
word
We
have
come
to
inspect
the
local
people
he
remarked
so
let
us
inspect
them
True
enough
seconded
Sitnikov
And
of
course
you
must
come
Monsieur
Kirsanov
We
could
not
go
without
you
What
Are
all
three
of
us
to
descend
upon
her
What
matter
She
herself
is
an
odd
person
And
you
say
that
she
will
stand
us
a
bottle
of
champagne
Yes
or
even
a
bottle
apiece
asserted
Sitnikov
I
will
go
bail
upon
that
Go
bail
with
what
With
my
head
Your
purse
would
have
been
better
but
lead
on

François
Pierre
Guillaume
Guizot
1787-1874
the
great
French
minister
ambassador
littérateur
and
educationalist
2
Madame
Svietchin
1782-1857
wife
of
the
Russian
General
Svietchin
For
more
than
forty
years
she
maintained
a
famous
salon
3
Etienne
Bonnot
de

de

1715-1780
a

solely
upon

4
Louis
Bourdaloue
1632-1704
a
professor
in
the
Jesuit
College
of
Bourges
The
villa
in
which
Avdotia
or
Evdoksia
Nikitishna
Kukshin
resided
was
one
of
the
usual
Moscow
pattern
and
stood
in
one
of
the
recently
consumed
streets
for
as
we
know
every
fifth
year
sees
each
of
our
provincial
capitals
burnt
to
the
ground
of
the
town
of
Beside
the
front
door
there
hung
over
a
cracked
crooked
visiting-card
a
bell-handle
while
in
the
hall
the
visitors
were
met
by
a
female
who
constituted
not
exactly
a
maidservant
but
a
mob-capped
lady
companion
And
it
need
hardly
be
added
that
these
two
phenomena
the
bell-handle
and
the
lady
companion
constituted
clear
evidence
of
the
progressiveness
of
the
hostess
's
views
On
Sitnikov
inquiring
whether
Avdotia
Nikitishna
were
within
a
shrill
voice
interrupted
him
from
an
adjoining
room
Is
that
you
Victor
Pray
enter
The
female
in
the
mob-cap
disappeared
I
have
not
come
alone
Sitnikov
responded
as
after
an
inquiring
glance
at
Arkady
and
Bazarov
he
divested
himself
of
his
greatcoat
and
revealed
thereunder
a
sort
of
sack
jacket
Never
mind
the
voice
replied
Entrez
s'il
vous
plaît
The
young
men
did
as
bidden
and
found
themselves
in
a
room
which
resembled
a
workshop
rather
than
a
parlour
On
tables
were
piled
promiscuous
papers
letters
and
Russian
magazines
most
of
the
latter
uncut
everywhere
on
the
floor
were
to
be
seen
gleaming
the
fag-ends
of
cigarettes
and
on
a
leather-padded
sofa
a
lady
youngish
flaxen-haired
and
clad
in
a
négligée
soiled
silk
gown
was
lolling
in
a
semi-recumbent
position
About
her
stumpy
wrists
were
clasped
a
large
pair
of
bracelets
and
over
her
head
was
thrown
a
lace
mantilla
Rising
she
draped
her
shoulders
carelessly
in
a
velvet
tippet
with
faded
ermine
trimming
and
saying
indolently
Good
day
Victor
pressed
Sitnikov
's
hand
Bazarov
Kirsanov
he
said
in
abrupt
imitation
of
the
former
whereupon
she
responded
How
do
you
do
and
then
added
as
she
fixed
upon
Bazarov
a
pair
of
large
eyes
between
which
glimmered
a
correspondingly
small
pink
upturned
nose
I
have
met
you
before
That
said
she
pressed
his
hand
even
as
she
had
done
Sitnikov
's
Bazarov
frowned
for
though
the
plain
insignificant
features
of
the
emancipated
lady
contained
nothing
actually
to
repel
there
was
something
in
their
mien
which
produced
upon
the
beholder
the
sort
of
unpleasant
impression
which
might
have
inclined
him
to
ask
her
Are
you
hungry
or
bored
or
afraid
At
all
events
what
is
it
you
want
Also
like
Sitnikov
she
kept
pawing
the
air
as
she
spoke
and
her
every
word
her
every
gesture
revealed
such
a
lack
of
control
as
at
times
amounted
to
sheer
awkwardness
In
short
though
she
conceived
herself
to
be
just
a
simple
good-hearted
creature
her
bearing
was
of
the
kind
to
lead
the
beholder
to
reflect
that
no
matter
what
she
did
it
was
not
what
she
had
intended
to
do
and
that
everything
was
done
to
use
the
children
's
term
on
purpose
that
is
to
say
non-simply
and
non-naturally
Yes
I
have
met
you
before
Bazarov
she
repeated
like
many
other
contemporary
females
of
Moscow
and
the
provinces
she
had
adopted
the
fashion
of
calling
men
by
their
surnames
alone
on
first
introduction
Will
you
have
a
cigar
I
thank
you
interposed
Sitnikov
who
had
deposited
his
person
in
an
armchair
and
crossed
his
legs
Also
pray
give
us
some
luncheon
for
we
are
absolutely
ravenous
Also
you
might
order
us
a
bottle
of
champagne
You
Sybarite
exclaimed
Evdoksia
with
a
smile
a
smile
always
brought
her
upper
gum
prominently
into
view
Is
he
not
Bazarov
No
it
is
merely
that
I
love
the
comforts
of
life
protested
Sitnikov
pompously
Nor
need
that
in
any
way
prevent
me
from
being
a
Liberal
But
it
does
it
does
cried
Evdoksia
However
she
gave
orders
to
her
servant
to
see
both
to
the
luncheon
and
to
the
champagne
What
is
your
opinion
on
the
matter
she
added
turning
to
Bazarov
I
feel
convinced
that
you
share
mine
No
I
do
not
he
replied
On
the
contrary
I
think
that
even
from
the
chemical
point
of
view
a
piece
of
meat
is
better
than
a
piece
of
bread
Then
you
study
chemistry
she
exclaimed
Chemistry
is
my
passion
also
In
fact
I
have
invented
a
special
liniment
A
liniment
You
Yes
I
And
please
guess
its
use
It
is
for
making
unbreakable
dolls
and
pipe-bowls
You
see
that
like
yourself
I
am
of
a
practical
turn
of
mind
But
as
yet
I
have
not
completed
my
course
of
study
It
still
remains
for
me
to
read
up
my
Liebig
Apropos
have
you
seen
an
article
in
the
Viedomosti
on
Woman
's
Work
an
article
by
Kisliakov
If
not
you
should
read
it
for
I
presume
that
you
take
an
interest
in
the
Feminine
Question
and
also
in
the
Question
of
the
Schools
But
what
is
your
friend
's
line
Apropos
what
is
his
name
These
questions
Madame
Kukshin
as
it
were
mouthed
and
did
so
with
an
affected
carelessness
which
waited
for
no
reply
even
as
a
spoilt
child
propounds
conundrums
to
its
nurse
My
name
is
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
Kirsanov
Arkady
answered
for
himself
And
my
particular
line
is
doing
nothing
at
all
Evdoksia
tittered
How
nice
she
exclaimed
Then
you
do
not
even
smoke
Victor
I
am
furious
with
you
Why
enquired
Sitnikov
Because
I
have
just
heard
that
you
are
again
standing
up
for
Georges
Sand
that
played-out
woman
How
is
she
even
to
be
compared
that
creature
who
lacks
a
single
idea
on
education
or
physiology
or
anything
else
with
Emerson
In
fact
I
believe
that
never
in
her
life
has
she
so
much
as
heard
of
embryology
though
in
these
days
no
one
can
get
on
without
it
The
speaker
flung
out
her
arms
in
an
expressive
gesture
But
what
a
splendid
article
was
that
of
Elisievitch
's
He
is
indeed
a
talented
gentleman
This
was
another
habit
of
Evdoksia
's
the
habit
of
persistently
using
the
term
gentleman
for
the
ordinary
word
man
Bazarov
pray
come
and
sit
beside
me
on
the
sofa
You
may
not
know
it
but
I
am
dreadfully
afraid
of
you
Why
are
you
afraid
of
me
if
you
will
forgive
my
curiosity
Because
you
are
a
dangerous
gentleman
you
are
a
critic
so
caustic
that
in
your
presence
my
confusion
leads
me
to
begin
speaking
like
a
lady-landowner
of
the
Steppes
Apropos
I
am
a
lady-landowner
myself
for
though
I
employ
a
local
steward
named
Erothei
a
sort
of
Cooper
's
'Pathfinder
but
compounded
with
a
blend
of
independence
in
his
composition
I
retain
the
ultimate
reins
of
management
in
my
own
hands
But
how
unbearable
this
town
is
yes
even
though
I
have
made
it
my
permanent
home
seeing
that
nothing
else
was
to
be
done
The
town
is
what
a
town
always
is
remarked
Bazarov
indifferently
But
its
interests
are
so
petty
continued
Evdoksia
That
is
what
troubles
me
Once
upon
a
time
I
used
to
winter
in
Moscow
but
now
good
Monsieur
Kukshin
has
to
dwell
there
alone
And
Moscow
itself
is
is
well
not
what
it
used
to
be
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
contemplate
going
abroad
I
have
spent
the
whole
year
in
making
my
preparations
for
the
journey
You
will
go
to
Paris
I
presume
Yes
and
to
Heidelberg
Why
to
Heidelberg
Because
there
the
great
Herr
Bunsen
1
has
his
home
Bazarov
could
not
think
of
a
suitable
reply
Do
you
know
Pierre
Sapozhnikov
continued
she
No
I
do
not
He
is
always
to
be
found
at
Lydia
Khostatov
's
Even
with
her
I
am
not
acquainted
Well
Sapozhnikov
is
going
to
escort
me
on
my
travels
For
at
least
I
am
free
I
have
no
children
thank
God
Why
I
should
have
put
in
that
'Thank
God
I
scarcely
know
She
rolled
another
cigarette
between
her
nicotine-stained
fingers
licked
it
placed
it
between
her
lips
and
struck
a
match
The
servant
entered
with
a
tray
Ah
Here
comes
luncheon
Will
you
have
some
Victor
pray
uncork
the
bottle
It
is
your
function
to
do
so
Mine
yes
mine
he
hummed
then
gave
another
of
his
shrill
giggles
Have
you
any
good-looking
ladies
in
this
town
Bazarov
asked
after
a
third
glassful
of
champagne
Yes
replied
Evdoksia
But
uniformly
they
are
futile
For
example
a
friend
of
mine
a
Madame
Odintsov
is
not
bad-looking
and
has
nothing
against
her
except
a
doubtful
reputation
a
thing
of
no
consequence
in
itself
but
alas
she
combines
with
it
such
a
complete
lack
of
freedom
or
of
breadth
of
view
or
in
fact
of
anything
The
system
of
bringing
up
women
needs
a
radical
change
I
myself
have
given
much
thought
to
the
matter
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
our
women
are
ill-educated
Yes
the
only
thing
to
be
done
with
them
is
to
hold
them
in
contempt
agreed
Sitnikov
To
him
any
opportunity
of
despising
of
expressing
scornful
sentiments
was
the
most
agreeable
of
sensations
Yet
though
he
thus
chose
women
for
his
especial
censure
he
little
suspected
that
before
many
months
were
over
he
himself
would
be
grovelling
at
the
feet
of
a
wife
and
doing
so
merely
for
the
reason
that
she
had
been
born
a
Princess
Durdoleosov
No
to
none
of
them
would
our
conversation
convey
anything
he
continued
Nor
is
there
a
single
one
of
them
upon
whom
the
attention
of
a
serious-minded
man
would
be
anything
but
thrown
away
Scarcely
need
they
desire
to
have
anything
conveyed
to
them
by
our
conversation
remarked
Bazarov
Of
whom
are
you
speaking
interposed
Evdoksia
Of
the
smart
women
of
the
day
What
I
suppose
you
agree
with
Proudhon
's
2
opinion
on
the
subject
Bazarov
drew
himself
up
I
agree
with
no
man
's
opinions
he
remarked
I
have
some
of
my
own
A
bas
les
autorités
cried
Sitnikov
delighted
at
this
unlooked-for
opportunity
of
showing
off
in
the
presence
of
the
man
whom
he
worshipped
But
even
Macaulay
began
Madame
Kukshin
A
bas
Macaulay
roared
Sitnikov
How
can
you
defend
those
dolls
of
ours
I
am
not
defending
them
