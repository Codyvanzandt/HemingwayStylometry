unfold
and
bloom
like
the
roses
in
summer
and
to
that
period
Thenichka
had
just
come
Everything
even
the
July
heat
then
prevalent
contributed
to
it
Dressed
in
a
gown
of
some
light
white
material
she
looked
even
lighter
and
whiter
than
it
and
though
she
escaped
actual
sunburn
the
heated
air
imparted
to
her
cheeks
and
ears
a
faint
tan
and
permeating
her
frame
with
gentle
indolence
imbued
her
exquisite
eyes
with
dreamy
languor
No
longer
could
she
do
any
work
she
could
only
let
her
hands
sink
upon
her
lap
and
there
remain
Seldom
going
even
for
a
stroll
she
spent
the
most
of
her
time
in
a
state
of
gently
querulous
and
panting
but
not
distasteful
inertia
You
should
go
and
bathe
as
often
as
you
can
Nikolai
Petrovitch
said
to
her
one
day
he
had
had
a
large
canopied
bathing-place
constructed
in
one
of
the
last
few
ponds
on
the
estate
Ah
she
gasped
Even
to
walk
to
the
pond
half-kills
me
and
to
walk
back
from
it
half-kills
me
again
There
is
no
shade
in
the
garden
you
see
True
he
agreed
wiping
his
forehead
At
seven
o'clock
one
morning
when
Bazarov
was
returning
from
a
walk
he
encountered
Thenichka
in
the
midst
of
a
lilac
clump
which
though
past
the
season
of
flowering
was
still
green
and
leafy
As
usual
she
had
a
white
scarf
thrown
over
her
head
and
beside
the
bench
on
which
she
was
sitting
there
was
a
bunch
of
red
and
white
roses
with
the
dew
yet
glistening
on
their
petals
He
bade
her
good
morning
It
is
you
then
Evgenii
Vasilitch
she
exclaimed
as
she
put
aside
a
corner
of
her
scarf
to
look
at
him
a
movement
which
bared
her
arm
to
the
elbow
What
are
you
doing
he
asked
as
he
seated
himself
beside
her
Is
it
a
nosegay
you
are
making
Yes
for
the
breakfast
table
Nikolai
Petrovitch
is
so
fond
of
such
things
But
breakfast
is
not
yet
What
a
waste
of
flowers
I
know
but
I
gather
them
now
because
later
the
weather
becomes
too
hot
for
walking
This
is
the
only
time
when
it
is
possible
even
to
breathe
The
heat
makes
me
faint
and
I
am
afraid
of
falling
ill
with
it
Mere
fancy
Let
me
feel
your
pulse
He
took
her
hand
in
his
and
found
the
pulse
to
be
beating
with
such
regularity
that
he
did
not
trouble
even
to
count
its
throbs
You
will
live
to
be
a
hundred
he
said
as
he
relinquished
her
wrist
God
preserve
me
from
that
exclaimed
she
Why
so
Surely
you
would
like
to
live
a
long
time
Yes
I
should
but
not
for
a
hundred
years
You
see
my
grandmother
lived
to
be
eighty-five
but
suffered
terribly
Long
before
she
died
she
had
a
constant
cough
and
was
also
blind
and
deaf
and
crooked
and
had
become
a
burden
to
herself
What
would
be
the
use
of
a
life
like
that
You
think
that
it
is
better
to
be
young
I
do
And
why
not
How
is
it
better
Tell
me
that
How
is
it
better
Oh
as
long
as
one
is
young
one
can
do
what
one
wants
to
do
one
can
walk
about
and
carry
things
and
not
be
dependent
upon
other
folk
Is
not
that
the
best
way
I
do
not
know
At
all
events
I
care
not
whether
I
be
young
or
old
What
makes
you
say
that
Surely
you
can
not
mean
it
No
Well
think
of
what
my
youth
means
to
me
I
am
a
lonely
man
a
man
without
home
or
But
all
depends
upon
yourself
No
it
does
not
I
only
wish
that
some
one
would
take
pity
upon
my
loneliness
She
glanced
at
him
but
said
nothing
After
a
pause
she
resumed
What
is
that
book
of
yours
This
It
is
a
learned
scholarly
work
How
you
study
Do
you
never
grow
tired
of
it
By
this
time
I
should
think
you
must
know
everything
Indeed
I
do
not
But
try
reading
a
few
lines
of
the
book
I
should
never
understand
them
Is
it
a
Russian
book
She
took
the
heavily
bound
volume
into
her
hands
What
a
large
book
she
continued
Yes
Also
it
is
a
Russian
book
Nevertheless
I
should
not
be
able
to
understand
it
I
do
not
want
you
to
understand
it
I
merely
want
to
be
able
to
watch
you
as
you
read
For
when
you
read
you
twitch
your
little
nose
most
charmingly
She
began
to
read
aloud
a
page
on
Creosote
but
soon
burst
out
laughing
and
replaced
the
book
upon
the
bench
whence
it
slipped
to
the
ground
I
love
to
see
you
laugh
said
Bazarov
Say
no
more
she
interrupted
Also
I
love
to
hear
you
speak
Your
voice
is
like
the
bubbling
of
a
brook
She
turned
away
her
head
and
fell
to
sorting
her
flowers
Presently
she
resumed
Why
do
you
love
to
hear
me
speak
You
must
have
talked
to
many
much
finer
and
cleverer
ladies
I
assure
you
nevertheless
that
all
the
I
fine
and
clever
ladies
in
the
world
are
worth
less
than
your
little
finger
Oh
come
And
she
crossed
her
hands
Bazarov
picked
up
the
book
It
is
a
work
on
medicine
he
observed
Why
did
you
throw
it
away
It
is
a
work
on
medicine
she
re-echoed
and
turned
to
him
again
Do
you
know
ever
since
you
gave
me
those
capsules
you
remember
them
do
you
not
Mitia
has
slept
splendidly
I
can
never
sufficiently
thank
you
You
are
indeed
good
But
the
physician
ought
to
be
paid
his
fee
remarked
he
with
a
smile
Doctors
never
do
their
work
for
nothing
Upon
this
she
raised
her
eyes
They
looked
all
the
darker
for
the
brilliant
glare
which
was
beating
upon
the
upper
portion
of
her
face
As
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
trying
to
divine
whether
he
was
speaking
in
earnest
or
in
jest
Of
course
I
should
be
delighted
to
pay
you
she
said
But
first
I
must
mention
the
matter
to
Nikolai
Petrovitch
What
he
exclaimed
You
really
think
it
is
money
I
want
No
I
do
not
require
of
you
money
What
then
she
queried
What
Well
guess
How
can
I
guess
Then
I
must
tell
you
I
want
I
want
I
want
one
of
those
roses
She
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
and
clapped
her
hands
with
delight
at
the
request
Yet
the
laughter
was
accompanied
with
a
certain
sense
of
relief
Bazarov
eyed
her
Ah
you
must
excuse
my
laughing
Evgenii
Vasilitch
she
said
bending
over
the
seat
of
the
bench
she
fumbled
among
the
roses
Which
sort
should
you
prefer
A
red
rose
or
a
white
one
A
red
one
and
not
too
large
Then
take
this
one
she
said
sitting
up
again
Yet
even
as
she
spoke
she
drew
back
her
outstretched
hand
and
biting
her
lips
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
entrance
to
the
arbour
and
listened
intently
What
is
it
asked
Bazarov
Do
you
hear
Nikolai
Petrovitch
coming
No
Besides
every
one
has
gone
out
to
the
fields
Nor
do
I
fear
any
one
except
Paul
Petrovitch
I
merely
thought
that
that
You
thought
what
That
some
one
might
be
coming
this
way
It
seems
I
was
wrong
Take
this
rose
She
handed
Bazarov
the
gift
Why
do
you
fear
Paul
Petrovitch
he
asked
I
do
so
because
he
frightens
me
when
I
speak
to
him
he
returns
me
no
answer
he
just
stares
at
me
in
a
meaning
sort
of
way
You
too
do
not
like
him
I
believe
It
was
with
him
that
you
had
such
a
quarrel
was
it
not
What
it
was
all
about
I
do
not
know
but
at
least
I
know
that
you
worsted
him
like
like
With
a
gesture
she
signified
the
manner
in
which
she
considered
Bazarov
to
have
routed
Paul
Petrovitch
And
had
he
worsted
me
he
inquired
would
you
have
taken
my
part
How
could
I
We
should
have
agreed
no
better
than
you
and
he
You
think
so
Then
let
me
tell
you
that
a
certain
little
hand
could
twist
me
around
its
little
finger
Whose
hand
is
that
I
expect
you
can
guess
But
smell
this
rose
which
you
have
just
given
me
She
bent
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
flower
and
as
she
did
so
her
scarf
slipped
from
her
head
to
her
shoulders
and
revealed
a
mass
of
dark
soft
fluffy
glossy
hair
Wait
said
Bazarov
I
too
will
smell
the
rose
And
reaching
forward
he
kissed
her
full
on
her
parted
lips
She
started
back
and
pressed
her
hands
against
his
breast
as
though
to
repel
him
but
so
weak
was
the
act
of
repulsion
that
he
found
it
possible
to
renew
and
to
prolong
his
kiss
Suddenly
there
sounded
from
among
the
lilac
bushes
a
dry
cough
and
just
as
Thenichka
darted
to
the
other
end
of
the
bench
Paul
Petrovitch
appeared
bowed
slightly
to
the
pair
said
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
acidity
in
his
tone
It
is
you
then
and
turned
on
his
heel
and
departed
The
next
moment
Thenichka
picked
up
her
roses
and
rushed
from
the
arbour
As
she
passed
Bazarov
she
whispered
in
his
ear
That
was
indeed
wrong
of
you
Evgenii
Vasilitch
And
the
words
voiced
a
note
of
reproach
that
was
palpably
genuine
and
unfeigned
Instantly
Bazarov
's
thoughts
recurred
to
another
scene
in
which
he
had
recently
taken
part
and
he
became
conscience-stricken
as
also
contemptuous
of
himself
and
vexed
He
shook
his
head
congratulated
himself
ironically
on
his
folly
and
departed
to
his
room
As
for
Paul
Petrovitch
he
left
the
garden
and
walked
slowly
into
the
forest
He
remained
there
a
considerable
time
and
on
returning
to
breakfast
looked
so
dark
of
mien
that
Nikolai
Petrovitch
inquired
anxiously
whether
he
were
not
ill
As
you
know
replied
the
other
quietly
I
suffer
habitually
from
biliousness
Two
hours
later
he
knocked
at
Bazarov
's
door
I
feel
that
I
must
apologise
for
disturbing
you
in
your
pursuits
he
said
as
he
seated
himself
near
the
window
and
rested
both
hands
upon
a
fine
ivory-headed
cane
which
he
had
brought
with
him
as
a
rule
he
did
not
carry
one
But
the
fact
is
that
circumstances
compel
me
to
request
five
minutes
of
your
time
The
whole
of
my
time
is
at
your
disposal
replied
Bazarov
across
whose
features
as
Paul
Petrovitch
had
crossed
the
threshold
there
had
flitted
a
curious
expression
No
five
minutes
will
be
sufficient
I
have
come
to
ask
you
a
simple
question
And
what
might
that
question
be
Listen
When
first
you
came
to
stay
in
my
brother
's
house
and
I
had
not
yet
been
forced
to
deny
myself
the
pleasure
of
conversing
with
you
it
fell
to
my
lot
to
hear
you
hold
forth
on
many
different
subjects
But
unless
my
memory
deceives
me
never
once
did
the
conversation
between
you
and
myself
or
in
my
presence
happen
to
fall
upon
the
subject
of
the
duel
or
single
combat
Would
you
therefore
mind
putting
yourself
out
to
the
extent
of
giving
me
the
benefit
of
your
views
on
the
subject
mentioned
Bazarov
who
had
risen
to
receive
his
visitor
now
reseated
himself
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
and
folded
his
arms
upon
his
breast
My
views
are
as
follows
he
replied
From
the
theoretical
standpoint
the
duel
is
a
sheer
absurdity
From
the
practical
standpoint
it
is
another
matter
altogether
You
intend
to
convey
if
I
have
understood
you
aright
that
apart
from
your
theoretical
views
on
the
duel
you
would
not
in
practice
allow
yourself
to
be
insulted
without
subsequently
demanding
satisfaction
You
have
guessed
my
meaning
precisely
Good
It
is
a
view
which
I
am
indeed
glad
to
hear
you
express
in
that
it
delivers
me
from
a
dilemma
You
mean
from
a
state
of
indecision
They
are
one
and
the
same
thing
I
express
myself
in
this
manner
to
the
end
that
you
may
understand
me
I
am
not
one
of
your
college
rats
Consequently
I
repeat
that
through
your
words
I
am
relieved
of
the
necessity
of
resorting
to
what
would
have
been
a
painful
expedient
To
speak
plainly
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
fight
you
Bazarov
raised
his
eyebrows
a
little
To
fight
me
he
said
Yes
to
fight
you
And
for
what
reason
if
you
do
not
mind
telling
me
For
a
reason
which
I
might
explain
but
concerning
which
I
prefer
to
remain
silent
Suffice
it
for
me
to
intimate
that
your
presence
offends
me
that
I
detest
and
despise
your
person
and
should
the
foregoing
be
insufficient
that
I
Enough
interrupted
Bazarov
His
eyes
had
flashed
even
as
Paul
's
had
done
Further
explanations
would
be
superfluous
You
have
presumed
to
whet
upon
me
your
chivalrous
spirit
wherefore
though
I
might
have
refused
it
I
will
afford
you
satisfaction
to
the
top
of
your
bent
I
have
to
express
to
you
my
sincere
obligation
From
the
first
did
I
feel
encouraged
to
hope
that
you
would
accept
my
challenge
without
constraining
me
to
resort
to
more
forcible
measures
In
other
words
and
speaking
without
metaphor
to
that
cane
said
Bazarov
in
a
tone
of
supreme
indifference
Well
that
is
fair
enough
Further
insults
are
not
needed
nor
would
you
have
found
the
offering
of
them
altogether
free
from
danger
Pray
therefore
remain
a
gentleman
It
is
as
one
that
I
accept
your
challenge
Good
replied
Paul
Petrovitch
and
he
laid
aside
his
cane
Next
a
few
words
on
the
subject
of
the
conditions
of
our
duel
First
pray
be
so
good
as
to
inform
me
whether
or
not
you
deem
it
necessary
to
resort
to
the
formality
of
some
such
small
difference
of
opinion
as
might
serve
as
an
ostensible
excuse
for
my
challenge
I
think
that
unnecessary
Such
things
are
best
done
without
formalities
of
any
kind
I
agree
that
is
to
say
I
like
you
consider
that
to
go
into
the
true
reasons
for
our
antagonism
would
be
inexpedient
Let
us
therefore
allege
to
the
world
that
we
could
not
abide
one
another
What
need
would
there
be
to
say
more
What
indeed
echoed
Bazarov
in
a
tone
decidedly
ironical
Also
with
regard
to
the
actual
conditions
of
the
duel
Inasmuch
as
we
have
no
seconds
for
where
could
we
find
them
Quite
so
Where
indeed
I
have
the
honour
to
propose
to
you
the
following
Let
us
fight
to-morrow
morning
say
at
six
o'clock
the
rendezvous
to
be
behind
the
copse
the
weapons
to
be
pistols
and
the
distance
ten
paces
Ten
paces
Quite
so
You
and
I
abhor
each
other
even
at
ten
paces
Eight
then
if
you
wish
The
same
applies
to
eight
And
the
number
of
shots
to
be
two
apiece
Also
in
case
either
of
us
should
fall
let
each
of
us
previously
place
in
his
pocket
a
letter
laying
upon
himself
the
entire
blame
for
his
demise
To
that
condition
I
wholly
demur
said
Bazarov
I
think
that
you
are
straying
into
the
pages
of
a
French
novel
and
away
from
reality
Possibly
I
am
But
also
you
will
agree
that
to
incur
an
unmerited
suspicion
of
murder
is
a
prospect
not
pleasant
to
contemplate
I
do
Yet
still
there
remains
another
method
of
avoiding
such
an
awkward
imputation
That
is
to
say
though
we
shall
have
no
seconds
we
can
have
a
witness
Whom
precisely
if
I
might
ask
Peter
Peter
What
Peter
Peter
the
valet
a
man
who
stands
at
the
apex
of
contemporary
culture
and
could
therefore
play
the
rôle
and
perform
the
functions
proper
to
such
an
occasion
pre-eminently
comme
il
faut
I
think
that
you
are
jesting
my
good
sir
No
I
am
not
If
you
will
deign
to
give
my
proposal
consideration
you
will
speedily
arrive
at
the
conviction
that
it
is
as
simple
as
it
is
charged
with
good
sense
Schiller
it
would
be
impossible
to
hide
in
a
bag
but
I
will
undertake
to
prepare
Peter
for
the
part
and
to
bring
him
to
the
rendezvous
Still
you
are
pleased
to
jest
said
Paul
Petrovitch
as
he
rose
But
as
you
have
so
kindly
met
me
I
have
not
the
right
to
make
further
claims
upon
your
time
All
is
arranged
then
In
passing
have
you
any
pistols
How
should
I
have
any
pistols
I
am
not
a
man
of
war
Then
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
offer
you
some
of
mine
Rest
assured
that
they
have
not
been
fired
by
me
for
five
years
A
very
comforting
assurance
Lastly
said
Paul
Petrovitch
as
he
reached
for
his
cane
it
only
remains
for
me
to
thank
you
and
to
leave
you
to
your
pursuits
I
have
the
honour
to
bid
you
good-day
And
I
to
say
farewell
until
our
pleasant
meeting
With
which
Bazarov
escorted
his
visitor
to
the
door
Paul
Petrovitch
gone
Bazarov
stood
awhile
in
thought
Then
he
exclaimed
Splendid
indeed
Yet
also
unutterably
stupid
What
a
comedy
to
play
Talk
of
educated
dogs
dancing
on
their
hind
legs
However
I
could
not
have
refused
him
for
otherwise
he
would
have
struck
me
and
then
Bazarov
turned
pale
for
his
pride
had
been
aroused
well
then
I
should
have
strangled
him
like
a
kitten
He
returned
to
his
microscope
but
found
his
heart
to
be
still
beating
and
the
coolness
necessary
to
scientific
observation
to
have
disappeared
I
suppose
he
saw
us
this
morning
he
continued
to
himself
Yet
surely
he
is
not
doing
this
on
his
brother
's
behalf
For
what
is
there
in
a
kiss
No
something
else
is
in
the
background
Bah
What
if
it
should
be
that
he
himself
is
in
love
with
her
Yes
that
is
it
It
is
as
clear
as
day
What
a
mess
Truly
a
horrible
mess
however
it
be
viewed
For
first
of
all
I
am
to
have
my
brains
blown
out
and
then
I
am
to
be
made
to
leave
this
place
And
there
is
Arkady
to
consider
and
that
old
heifer
Nikolai
Petrovitch
Awkward
Awkward
indeed
However
the
day
dragged
its
slow
length
along
Thenichka
remained
practically
non-existent
in
other
words
she
kept
to
her
room
as
closely
as
a
mouse
to
its
hole
Nikolai
Petrovitch
walked
about
with
a
careworn
air
it
had
been
reported
to
him
that
mildew
had
begun
to
attack
the
wheat
and
Paul
Petrovitch
's
mien
of
icy
urbanity
succeeded
in
damping
the
spirits
of
Prokofitch
himself
Presently
Bazarov
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
to
his
father
but
tore
it
up
and
threw
the
pieces
under
the
table
Should
I
be
killed
he
reflected
my
parents
will
hear
of
it
soon
enough
But
I
shall
not
be
killed
I
have
yet
far
to
wander
about
the
world
Next
he
ordered
Peter
to
call
him
at
dawn
and
inasmuch
as
the
order
was
accompanied
with
a
mention
of
important
business
Peter
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
Bazarov
's
intention
to
take
him
to
St
Petersburg
Bazarov
then
retired
to
rest
Yet
late
though
he
had
done
so
he
was
troubled
with
fantastic
visions
Ever
before
him
there
flitted
Madame
Odintsov
who
was
also
his
mother
And
ever
behind
her
there
walked
a
black
cat
which
was
also
Thenichka
For
his
part
Paul
Petrovitch
figured
as
a
forest
which
the
dreamer
was
engaged
to
fight
At
length
when
four
o'clock
arrived
Peter
came
to
rouse
him
Hastily
dressing
himself
he
left
the
house
with
the
valet
The
morning
was
fine
and
fresh
and
though
a
few
wisps
of
cloud
were
trailing
across
the
pale-blue
transparency
of
the
zenith
a
light
dew
had
coated
the
grass
and
foliage
with
drops
and
was
shining
like
silver
on
spiders
webs
The
steaming
earth
seemed
still
to
be
seeking
to
detain
the
roseate
traces
of
dawn
in
her
embrace
but
presently
every
quarter
of
the
sky
became
lit
up
and
resounded
again
to
the
songs
of
larks
Bazarov
walked
straight
ahead
until
he
reached
the
copse
then
seated
himself
at
the
shadowy
edge
of
the
trees
and
explained
to
Peter
the
services
which
he
looked
to
the
latter
to
perform
upon
which
the
cultured
menial
came
near
to
fainting
and
was
calmed
only
with
an
assurance
that
he
would
but
have
to
stand
at
a
distance
as
a
looker-on
and
that
in
no
case
would
responsibility
attach
to
his
person
And
think
Bazarov
concluded
in
what
an
important
rôle
you
are
about
to
figure
But
Peter
extending
his
hands
deprecatingly
only
turned
up
his
eyes
became
green
in
the
face
and
went
and
leant
against
a
birch
tree
The
copse
was
skirted
by
the
road
from
Marino
and
the
light
coating
of
dust
bore
no
mark
of
having
been
disturbed
since
the
previous
evening
whether
by
wheel
or
by
foot
Involuntarily
Bazarov
kept
glancing
along
this
road
as
plucking
and
chewing
stems
of
grass
he
repeated
again
and
again
to
himself
What
a
piece
of
folly
More
than
once
too
the
morning
air
made
him
shiver
and
Peter
gaze
plaintively
in
his
direction
but
Bazarov
only
laughed
for
he
at
least
was
no
coward
At
length
hoofs
sounded
along
the
road
and
there
came
into
sight
from
behind
the
trees
a
peasant
driving
two
horses
with
traces
attached
As
the
man
passed
Bazarov
he
looked
at
him
inquisitively
but
failed
to
doff
his
cap
and
this
circumstance
impressed
Peter
unfavourably
since
the
valet
considered
it
a
bad
omen
Like
ourselves
that
peasant
has
risen
early
thought
Bazarov
But
whereas
he
has
risen
to
work
we
Some
one
else
is
coming
I
believe
whispered
Peter
Bazarov
raised
his
head
and
saw
Paul
Petrovitch
in
a
light
check
jacket
and
a
pair
of
snow-white
trousers
walking
briskly
along
the
road
Under
his
arm
was
a
green
baize-covered
box
Pardon
me
for
having
kept
you
waiting
he
said
with
a
bow
to
Bazarov
and
then
one
to
Peter
for
even
to
the
latter
he
for
the
nonce
seemed
to
accord
something
of
the
respect
due
to
a
second
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
was
loth
to
arouse
my
valet
I
beg
that
you
will
not
mention
it
replied
Bazarov
We
ourselves
have
only
just
arrived
So
much
the
better
And
Paul
Petrovitch
glanced
about
him
There
will
be
no
one
to
see
us
or
disturb
us
Are
you
agreeable
to
proceeding
Quite
And
I
presume
that
you
require
no
further
explanations
None
whatsoever
Then
kindly
load
these
Paul
Petrovitch
took
from
the
box
a
brace
of
pistols
No
Do
you
load
while
I
measure
the
distance
my
legs
are
longer
than
yours
This
last
Bazarov
added
with
a
dry
smile
Now
one
two
three
I
beg
your
pardon
sir
gasped
Peter
who
was
trembling
as
with
ague
I
beg
your
pardon
but
might
I
move
further
away
Four
five
Certainly
my
good
fellow
Pray
do
so
You
can
go
and
stand
behind
that
tree
there
and
stop
your
ears
provided
that
you
do
not
also
stop
your
eyes
Lastly
should
either
Monsieur
Kirsanov
or
myself
fall
you
are
to
run
and
pick
up
the
fallen
Six
seven
eight
Bazarov
halted
That
will
do
I
suppose
he
added
to
Paul
Petrovitch
Or
would
you
prefer
me
to
add
another
couple
of
paces
Do
as
you
please
the
other
replied
as
he
rammed
home
the
second
of
the
two
bullets
Then
I
will
add
those
two
paces
And
Bazarov
scratched
a
line
in
the
soil
with
his
toe
Here
is
the
mark
Apropos
how
many
paces
is
each
of
us
to
retire
from
our
respective
marks
Ten
I
presume
said
Paul
Petrovitch
as
he
proffered
Bazarov
a
brace
of
pistols
Will
you
kindly
make
choice
of
these
I
will
Nevertheless
you
will
agree
that
our
duel
is
singular
even
to
the
point
of
absurdity
For
pray
observe
the
countenance
of
our
second
It
is
still
your
pleasure
to
jest
Paul
Petrovitch
responded
coldly
Of
the
singularity
of
our
contest
I
make
no
denial
I
merely
consider
it
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
I
intend
to
right
you
in
grim
earnest
So
à
bon
entendeur
salut
Yet
even
though
we
intend
to
exterminate
one
another
why
should
we
not
enjoy
our
jest
and
thus
combine
utile
with
dulce
You
have
spoken
to
me
in
French
I
reply
in
Latin
I
repeat
that
I
intend
to
fight
you
in
grim
earnest
said
Paul
Petrovitch
with
which
he
moved
to
his
place
and
Bazarov
after
counting
ten
paces
from
his
mark
turned
and
halted
Are
you
ready
inquired
Paul
Petrovitch
I
am
Then
engage
Bazarov
started
to
advance
and
Paul
Petrovitch
did
the
same
with
his
left
hand
thrust
into
his
coat
pocket
and
his
right
gradually
elevating
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
The
fellow
is
aiming
straight
for
my
nose
thought
Bazarov
to
himself
And
how
the
rascal
is
screwing
up
his
eyes
as
he
marches
This
is
not
a
wholly
pleasing
sensation
I
had
better
keep
my
eyes
fixed
upon
his
watch-chain
Past
Bazarov
's
ear
something
suddenly
whistled
while
almost
at
the
same
moment
there
came
the
sound
of
a
report
I
seemed
to
hear
something
but
no
matter
was
the
thought
which
flashed
through
Bazarov
's
brain
Then
he
advanced
another
step
and
without
aiming
pulled
the
trigger
As
he
did
so
Paul
Petrovitch
gave
a
faint
start
and
clapped
his
hand
to
his
thigh
down
the
white
trouser-leg
of
which
there
began
to
trickle
a
thin
stream
of
blood
Bazarov
threw
aside
his
pistol
and
approached
his
antagonist
Are
you
wounded
he
inquired
Pray
recall
me
to
the
mark
said
Paul
Petrovitch
You
have
the
right
so
to
do
and
we
are
merely
wasting
time
The
conditions
of
the
contest
allow
of
a
second
shot
apiece
Pardon
me
that
can
be
deferred
said
Bazarov
catching
hold
of
Paul
Petrovitch
who
was
beginning
to
turn
pale
in
the
face
I
am
no
longer
a
duellist
but
a
doctor
and
must
examine
your
wound
Peter
Here
Where
the
devil
has
the
man
got
to
This
is
sheer
folly
gasped
Paul
Petrovitch
I
need
no
help
Let
us
Yet
even
as
he
tried
to
twirl
his
moustache
his
arm
fell
to
his
side
his
eyes
closed
and
he
collapsed
in
a
swoon
Something
new
involuntarily
cried
Bazarov
as
he
laid
his
antagonist
upon
the
grass
A
swoon
Let
us
see
what
is
the
matter
with
him
Taking
out
his
pocket-handkerchief
he
wiped
away
the
blood
and
probed
the
neighbourhood
of
the
wound
The
bone
is
intact
he
muttered
Yes
and
the
bullet
has
merely
pierced
the
flesh
a
little
below
the
surface
Nothing
but
the
musculus
vastus
externus
is
so
much
as
touched
In
three
weeks
time
we
shall
have
him
trotting
about
again
A
swoon
Oh
these
men
of
nerves
What
thin
skins
to
be
sure
Is
is
he
dead
came
in
Peter
's
tremulous
voice
from
behind
Bazarov
looked
up
No
he
said
Run
for
a
little
water
and
he
will
outlive
us
both
Unfortunately
the
perfect
servant
did
not
understand
what
was
said
to
him
but
remained
stock
still
In
fact
even
when
the
next
moment
Paul
Petrovitch
opened
his
eyes
Peter
went
on
crossing
himself
and
repeating
He
is
dying
Monsieur
Bazarov
the
wounded
man
said
with
a
twisted
smile
you
were
perfectly
in
the
right
when
you
said
that
the
face
of
that
man
was
the
face
of
a
fool
It
is
so
agreed
Bazarov
Damn
you
will
you
fetch
some
water
The
latter
to
the
valet
There
is
no
need
put
in
Paul
Petrovitch
It
was
only
a
passing
vertigo
Kindly
assist
me
to
sit
up
That
is
it
A
scratch
like
this
will
require
only
to
be
bandaged
for
me
to
walk
home
again
There
will
be
no
necessity
to
have
the
drozhki
sent
For
that
matter
the
duel
need
not
be
renewed
unless
you
wish
it
At
least
to-day
you
have
acted
like
a
gentleman
Kindly
note
that
I
have
said
so
To
the
past
we
have
no
need
to
refer
said
Bazarov
And
as
regards
the
future
it
calls
for
equally
little
remark
seeing
that
I
intend
to
leave
here
at
once
Allow
me
to
bind
your
leg
The
wound
is
not
dangerous
but
one
of
a
nature
which
will
make
it
as
well
to
have
the
blood
staunched
But
first
I
must
restore
that
stuck
pig
to
life
Shaking
Peter
vigorously
by
the
collar
he
dispatched
him
in
search
of
the
drozhki
But
see
that
you
do
not
alarm
my
brother
was
Paul
Petrovitch's
injunction
also
to
the
man
You
are
not
to
breathe
a
word
of
what
has
happened
Peter
set
off
at
full
speed
During
the
time
that
he
was
hastening
for
the
drozhki
the
two
antagonists
sat
silently
side
by
side
on
the
ground
while
Paul
Petrovitch
tried
his
best
not
to
look
at
Bazarov
for
the
reason
that
he
did
not
feel
inclined
to
become
reconciled
with
him
while
at
the
same
time
he
felt
ashamed
alike
of
his
impulsiveness
his
failure
and
the
scheme
which
had
had
this
ending
though
he
realised
that
it
might
have
been
worse
At
least
will
the
fellow
swagger
here
no
more
he
thought
to
himself
by
way
of
consolation
And
for
that
much
thanks
The
silence
was
a
heavy
awkward
silence
for
neither
of
the
pair
felt
comfortable
each
of
them
recognised
that
the
other
had
taken
his
measure
To
friends
such
a
recognition
may
be
very
agreeable
but
to
foes
it
is
far
from
welcome
least
of
all
when
neither
explanations
nor
a
parting
are
feasible
I
hope
that
I
have
not
bound
your
leg
too
tightly
said
Bazarov
at
last
Oh
no
replied
Paul
Petrovitch
As
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
doing
splendidly
After
a
pause
he
added
But
we
can
not
deceive
my
brother
How
