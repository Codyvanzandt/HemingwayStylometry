you
know
where
you
read
Faust
She
said
this
so
distinctly
that
I
can
t
to
this
day
conceive
how
it
was
Priemkov
who
came
into
the
room
at
that
instant
heard
nothing
Slowly
terribly
slowly
passed
that
day
Vera
sometimes
looked
about
her
with
an
expression
as
though
she
were
asking
herself
if
she
were
not
dreaming
And
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
look
of
determination
in
her
face
while
I
I
could
not
recover
myself
Vera
loves
me
These
words
were
continually
going
round
and
round
in
my
head
but
I
did
not
understand
them
I
neither
understood
myself
nor
her
I
could
not
believe
in
such
unhoped-for
such
overwhelming
happiness
with
an
effort
I
recalled
the
past
and
I
too
looked
and
talked
as
in
a
dream
After
evening
tea
when
I
had
already
begun
to
think
how
I
could
steal
out
of
the
house
unobserved
she
suddenly
announced
of
her
own
accord
that
she
wanted
a
walk
and
asked
me
to
accompany
her
I
got
up
took
my
hat
and
followed
her
I
did
not
dare
begin
to
speak
I
could
scarcely
breathe
I
awaited
her
first
word
I
awaited
explanations
but
she
did
not
speak
In
silence
we
reached
the
summer-house
in
silence
we
went
into
it
and
then
I
don
t
know
to
this
day
I
can
t
understand
how
it
happened
we
suddenly
found
ourselves
in
each
other
s
arms
Some
unseen
force
flung
me
to
her
and
her
to
me
In
the
fading
daylight
her
face
with
the
curls
tossed
back
lighted
up
for
an
instant
with
a
smile
of
self-surrender
and
tenderness
and
our
lips
met
in
a
kiss
That
kiss
was
the
first
and
last
Vera
suddenly
broke
from
my
arms
and
with
an
expression
of
horror
in
her
wide
open
eyes
staggered
back
Look
round
she
said
in
a
shaking
voice
do
you
see
nothing
I
turned
round
quickly
Nothing
Why
do
you
see
something
Not
now
but
I
did
She
drew
deep
gasping
breaths
Whom
what
My
mother
she
said
slowly
and
she
began
trembling
all
over
I
shivered
too
as
though
with
cold
I
suddenly
felt
ashamed
as
though
I
were
guilty
And
indeed
wasn
t
I
guilty
at
that
instant
Nonsense
I
began
what
do
you
mean
Tell
me
rather
No
for
God
s
sake
no
she
interposed
clutching
her
head
This
is
madness
I
m
going
out
of
my
mind
One
can
t
play
with
this
it
s
death
Good-bye
I
held
out
my
hands
to
her
Stay
for
God
s
sake
for
an
instant
I
cried
in
an
involuntary
outburst
I
didn
t
know
what
I
was
saying
and
could
scarcely
stand
upright
For
God
s
sake
it
is
too
cruel
She
glanced
at
me
To-morrow
to-morrow
evening
she
said
not
to-day
I
beseech
you
go
away
to-day
to-morrow
evening
come
to
the
garden
gate
near
the
lake
I
will
be
there
I
will
come
I
swear
to
you
I
will
come
she
added
with
passion
and
her
eyes
shone
whoever
may
hinder
me
I
swear
I
will
tell
you
everything
only
let
me
go
to-day
And
before
I
could
utter
a
word
she
was
gone
Utterly
distraught
I
stayed
where
I
was
My
head
was
in
a
whirl
Across
the
mad
rapture
which
filled
my
whole
being
there
began
to
steal
a
feeling
of
apprehension
I
looked
round
The
dim
damp
room
in
which
I
was
standing
oppressed
me
with
its
low
roof
and
dark
walls
I
went
out
and
walked
with
dejected
steps
towards
the
house
Vera
was
waiting
for
me
on
the
terrace
she
went
into
the
house
directly
I
drew
near
and
at
once
retreated
to
her
bedroom
I
went
away
How
I
spent
the
night
and
the
next
day
till
the
evening
I
can
t
tell
you
I
only
remember
that
I
lay
my
face
hid
in
my
hands
I
recalled
her
smile
before
our
kiss
I
whispered
At
last
she
I
recalled
too
Madame
Eltsov
s
words
which
Vera
had
repeated
to
me
She
had
said
to
her
once
You
are
like
ice
until
you
melt
as
strong
as
stone
but
directly
you
melt
there
s
nothing
of
you
left
Another
thing
recurred
to
my
mind
Vera
and
I
had
once
been
talking
of
talent
ability
There
s
only
one
thing
I
can
do
she
said
keep
silent
till
the
last
minute
I
did
not
understand
it
in
the
least
at
the
time
But
what
is
the
meaning
of
her
fright
I
wondered
Can
she
really
have
seen
Madame
Eltsov
Imagination
I
thought
and
again
I
gave
myself
up
to
the
emotions
of
expectation
It
was
on
that
day
I
wrote
you
with
what
thoughts
in
my
head
it
hurts
me
to
recall
that
deceitful
letter
In
the
evening
the
sun
had
not
yet
set
I
took
up
my
stand
about
fifty
paces
from
the
garden
gate
in
a
tall
thicket
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
I
had
come
from
home
on
foot
I
will
confess
to
my
shame
fear
fear
of
the
most
cowardly
kind
filled
my
heart
I
was
incessantly
starting
but
I
had
no
feeling
of
remorse
Hiding
among
the
twigs
I
kept
continual
watch
on
the
little
gate
It
did
not
open
The
sun
set
the
evening
drew
on
then
the
stars
came
out
and
the
sky
turned
black
No
one
appeared
I
was
in
a
fever
Night
came
on
I
could
bear
it
no
longer
I
came
cautiously
out
of
the
thicket
and
stole
down
to
the
gate
Everything
was
still
in
the
garden
I
called
Vera
in
a
whisper
called
a
second
time
a
third
No
voice
called
back
Half-an-hour
more
passed
by
and
an
hour
it
became
quite
dark
I
was
worn
out
by
suspense
I
drew
the
gate
towards
me
opened
it
at
once
and
on
tiptoe
like
a
thief
walked
towards
the
house
I
stopped
in
the
shadow
of
a
lime-tree
Almost
all
the
windows
in
the
house
had
lights
in
them
people
were
moving
to
and
fro
in
the
house
This
surprised
me
my
watch
as
far
as
I
could
make
out
in
the
dim
starlight
said
half-past
eleven
Suddenly
I
heard
a
noise
near
the
house
a
carriage
drove
out
of
the
courtyard
Visitors
it
seems
I
thought
Losing
every
hope
of
seeing
Vera
I
made
my
way
out
of
the
garden
and
walked
with
rapid
steps
homewards
It
was
a
dark
September
night
but
warm
and
windless
The
feeling
not
so
much
of
annoyance
as
of
sadness
which
had
taken
possession
of
me
gradually
disappeared
and
I
got
home
rather
tired
from
my
rapid
walk
but
soothed
by
the
peacefulness
of
the
night
happy
and
almost
light-hearted
I
went
to
my
room
dismissed
Timofay
and
without
undressing
flung
myself
on
my
bed
and
plunged
into
reverie
At
first
my
day-dreams
were
sweet
but
soon
I
noticed
a
curious
change
in
myself
I
began
to
feel
a
sort
of
secret
gnawing
anxiety
a
sort
of
deep
inward
uneasiness
I
could
not
understand
what
it
arose
from
but
I
began
to
feel
sick
and
sad
as
though
I
were
menaced
by
some
approaching
trouble
as
though
some
one
dear
to
me
were
suffering
at
that
instant
and
calling
on
me
for
help
A
wax
candle
on
the
table
burnt
with
a
small
steady
flame
the
pendulum
swung
with
a
heavy
regular
tick
I
leant
my
head
on
my
hand
and
fell
to
gazing
into
the
empty
half-dark
of
my
lonely
room
I
thought
of
Vera
and
my
heart
failed
me
all
at
which
I
had
so
rejoiced
struck
me
as
it
ought
to
have
done
as
unhappiness
as
hopeless
ruin
The
feeling
of
apprehension
grew
and
grew
I
could
not
lie
still
any
longer
I
suddenly
fancied
again
that
some
one
was
calling
me
in
a
voice
of
entreaty
I
raised
my
head
and
shuddered
I
had
not
been
mistaken
a
pitiful
cry
floated
out
of
the
distance
and
rang
faintly
resounding
on
the
dark
window-panes
I
was
frightened
I
jumped
off
the
bed
I
opened
the
window
A
distinct
moan
broke
into
the
room
and
as
it
were
hovered
about
me
Chilled
with
terror
I
drank
in
its
last
dying
echoes
It
seemed
as
though
some
one
were
being
killed
in
the
distance
and
the
luckless
wretch
were
beseeching
in
vain
for
mercy
Whether
it
was
an
owl
hooting
in
the
wood
or
some
other
creature
that
uttered
this
wail
I
did
not
think
to
consider
at
the
time
but
like
Mazeppa
I
called
back
in
answer
to
the
ill-omened
sound
Vera
Vera
I
cried
is
it
you
calling
me
Timofay
sleepy
and
amazed
appeared
before
me
I
came
to
my
senses
drank
a
glass
of
water
and
went
into
another
room
but
sleep
did
not
come
to
me
My
heart
throbbed
painfully
though
not
rapidly
I
could
not
abandon
myself
to
dreams
of
happiness
again
I
dared
not
believe
in
it
Next
day
before
dinner
I
went
to
the
Priemkovs
Priemkov
met
me
with
a
care-worn
face
My
wife
is
ill
he
began
she
is
in
bed
I
sent
for
a
doctor
What
is
the
matter
with
her
I
can
t
make
out
Yesterday
evening
she
went
into
the
garden
and
suddenly
came
back
quite
beside
herself
panic-stricken
Her
maid
ran
for
me
I
went
in
and
asked
my
wife
what
was
wrong
She
made
no
answer
and
so
she
has
lain
by
night
delirium
set
in
In
her
delirium
she
said
all
sorts
of
things
she
mentioned
you
The
maid
told
me
an
extraordinary
thing
that
Vera
s
mother
appeared
to
her
in
the
garden
she
fancied
she
was
coming
to
meet
her
with
open
arms
You
can
imagine
what
I
felt
at
these
words
Of
course
that
s
nonsense
Priemkov
went
on
though
I
must
admit
that
extraordinary
things
have
happened
to
my
wife
in
that
way
And
you
say
Vera
Nikolaevna
is
very
unwell
Yes
she
was
very
bad
in
the
night
now
she
is
wandering
What
did
the
doctor
say
The
doctor
said
that
the
disease
was
undefined
as
yet
March
12
I
can
not
go
on
as
I
began
dear
friend
it
costs
me
too
much
effort
and
re-opens
my
wounds
too
cruelly
The
disease
to
use
the
doctor
s
words
became
defined
and
Vera
died
of
it
She
did
not
live
a
fortnight
after
the
fatal
day
of
our
momentary
interview
I
saw
her
once
more
before
her
death
I
have
no
memory
more
heart-rending
I
had
already
learned
from
the
doctor
that
there
was
no
hope
Late
in
the
evening
when
every
one
in
the
house
was
in
bed
I
stole
to
the
door
of
her
room
and
looked
in
at
her
Vera
lay
in
her
bed
with
closed
eyes
thin
and
small
with
a
feverish
flush
on
her
cheeks
I
gazed
at
her
as
though
turned
to
stone
All
at
once
she
opened
her
eyes
fastened
them
upon
me
scrutinised
me
and
stretching
out
a
wasted
hand
Was

Faust
Part
I
Last
Scene
she
articulated
in
a
voice
so
terrible
that
I
rushed
headlong
away
Almost
all
through
her
illness
she
raved
about
Faust
and
her
mother
whom
she
sometimes
called
Martha
sometimes
Gretchen
s
mother
Vera
died
I
was
at
her
burying
Ever
since
then
I
have
given
up
everything
and
am
settled
here
for
ever
Think
now
of
what
I
have
told
you
think
of
her
of
that
being
so
quickly
brought
to
destruction
How
it
came
to
pass
how
explain
this
incomprehensible
intervention
of
the
dead
in
the
affairs
of
the
living
I
don
t
know
and
never
shall
know
But
you
must
admit
that
it
is
not
a
fit
of
whimsical
spleen
as
you
express
it
which
has
driven
me
to
retire
from
the
world
I
am
not
what
I
was
as
you
knew
me
I
believe
in
a
great
deal
now
which
I
did
not
believe
formerly
All
this
time
I
have
thought
so
much
of
that
unhappy
woman
I
had
almost
said
girl
of
her
origin
of
the
secret
play
of
fate
which
we
in
our
blindness
call
blind
chance
Who
knows
what
seeds
each
man
living
on
earth
leaves
behind
him
which
are
only
destined
to
come
up
after
his
death
Who
can
say
by
what
mysterious
bond
a
man
s
fate
is
bound
up
with
his
children
s
his
descendants
how
his
yearnings
are
reflected
in
them
and
how
they
are
punished
for
his
errors
We
must
all
submit
and
bow
our
heads
before
the
Unknown
Yes
Vera
perished
while
I
was
untouched
I
remember
when
I
was
a
child
we
had
in
my
home
a
lovely
vase
of
transparent
alabaster
Not
a
spot
sullied
its
virgin
whiteness
One
day
when
I
was
left
alone
I
began
shaking
the
stand
on
which
it
stood
the
vase
suddenly
fell
down
and
broke
to
shivers
I
was
numb
with
horror
and
stood
motionless
before
the
fragments
My
father
came
in
saw
me
and
said
There
see
what
you
have
done
we
shall
never
have
our
lovely
vase
again
now
there
is
no
mending
it
I
sobbed
I
felt
I
had
committed
a
crime
I
grew
into
a
man
and
thoughtlessly
broke
a
vessel
a
thousand
times
more
precious
In
vain
I
tell
myself
that
I
could
not
have
dreamed
of
such
a
sudden
catastrophe
that
it
struck
me
too
with
its
suddenness
that
I
did
not
even
suspect
what
sort
of
nature
Vera
was
She
certainly
knew
how
to
be
silent
till
the
last
minute
I
ought
to
have
run
away
directly
I
felt
that
I
loved
her
that
I
loved
a
married
woman
But
I
stayed
and
that
fair
being
was
shattered
and
with
despair
I
gaze
at
the
work
of
my
own
hands
Yes
Madame
Eltsov
took
jealous
care
of
her
daughter
She
guarded
her
to
the
end
and
at
the
first
incautious
step
bore
her
away
with
her
to
the
grave
It
is
time
to
make
an
end
I
have
not
told
one
hundredth
part
of
what
I
ought
to
have
but
this
has
been
enough
for
me
Let
all
that
has
flamed
up
fall
back
again
into
the
depths
of
my
heart
In
conclusion
I
say
to
you
one
conviction
I
have
gained
from
the
experience
of
the
last
years
life
is
not
jest
and
not
amusement
life
is
not
even
enjoyment
life
is
hard
labour
Renunciation
continual
renunciation
that
is
its
secret
meaning
its
solution
Not
the
fulfilment
of
cherished
dreams
and
aspirations
however
lofty
they
may
be
the
fulfilment
of
duty
that
is
what
must
be
the
care
of
man
Without
laying
on
himself
chains
the
iron
chains
of
duty
he
can
not
reach
without
a
fall
the
end
of
his
career
But
in
youth
we
think
the
freer
the
better
the
further
one
will
get
Youth
may
be
excused
for
thinking
so
But
it
is
shameful
to
delude
oneself
when
the
stern
face
of
truth
has
looked
one
in
the
eyes
at
last
Good-bye
In
old
days
I
would
have
added
be
happy
now
I
say
to
you
try
to
live
it
is
not
so
easy
as
it
seems
Think
of
me
not
in
hours
of
sorrow
but
in
hours
of
contemplation
and
keep
in
your
heart
the
image
of
Vera
in
all
its
pure
stainlessness
Once
more
good-bye
Yours

At
that
time
I
was
five-and-twenty
began
N
N
it
was
in
days
long
past
as
you
perceive
I
had
only
just
gained
my
freedom
and
gone
abroad
not
to
finish
my
education
as
the
phrase
was
in
those
days
I
simply
wanted
to
have
a
look
at
God
s
world
I
was
young
and
in
good
health
and
spirits
and
had
plenty
of
money
Troubles
had
not
yet
had
time
to
gather
about
me
I
existed
without
thought
did
as
I
liked
lived
like
the
lilies
of
the
field
in
fact
It
never
occurred
to
me
in
those
days
that
man
is
not
a
plant
and
can
not
go
on
living
like
one
for
long
Youth
will
eat
gilt
gingerbread
and
fancy
it
s
daily
bread
too
but
the
time
comes
when
you
re
in
want
of
dry
bread
even
There
s
no
need
to
go
into
that
though
I
travelled
without
any
sort
of
aim
without
a
plan
I
stopped
wherever
I
liked
the
place
and
went
on
again
directly
I
felt
a
desire
to
see
new
faces
faces
nothing
else
I
was
interested
in
people
exclusively
I
hated
famous
monuments
and
museums
of
curiosities
the
very
sight
of
a
guide
produced
in
me
a
sense
of
weariness
and
anger
I
was
almost
driven
crazy
in
the
Dresden
Gr
ne-Gew
lbe
Nature
affected
me
extremely
but
I
did
not
care
for
the
so-called
beauties
of
nature
extraordinary
mountains
precipices
and
waterfalls
I
did
not
like
nature
to
obtrude
to
force
itself
upon
me
But
faces
living
human
faces
people
s
talk
and
gesture
and
laughter
that
was
what
was
absolutely
necessary
to
me
In
a
crowd
I
always
had
a
special
feeling
of
ease
and
comfort
I
enjoyed
going
where
others
went
shouting
when
others
shouted
and
at
the
same
time
I
liked
to
look
at
the
others
shouting
It
amused
me
to
watch
people
though
I
didn
t
even
watch
them
I
simply
stared
at
them
with
a
sort
of
delighted
ever-eager
curiosity
But
I
am
diverging
again
And
so
twenty
years
ago
I
was
staying
in
the
little
German
town
Z
on
the
left
bank
of
the
Rhine
I
was
seeking
solitude
I
had
just
been
stabbed
to
the
heart
by
a
young
widow
with
whom
I
had
made
acquaintance
at
a
watering-place
She
was
very
pretty
and
clever
and
flirted
with
every
one
with
me
too
poor
sinner
At
first
she
had
positively
encouraged
me
but
later
on
she
cruelly
wounded
my
feelings
sacrificing
me
for
a
red-faced
Bavarian
lieutenant
It
must
be
owned
the
wound
to
my
heart
was
not
a
very
deep
one
but
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
give
myself
up
for
a
time
to
gloom
and
solitude
youth
will
find
amusement
in
anything
and
so
I
settled
at
Z
I
liked
the
little
town
for
its
situation
on
the
slope
of
two
high
hills
its
ruined
walls
and
towers
its
ancient
lime-trees
its
steep
bridge
over
the
little
clear
stream
that
falls
into
the
Rhine
and
most
of
all
for
its
excellent
wine
In
the
evening
directly
after
sunset
it
was
June
very
pretty
flaxen-haired
German
girls
used
to
walk
about
its
narrow
streets
and
articulate
Guten
Abend
in
agreeable
voices
on
meeting
a
stranger
some
of
them
did
not
go
home
even
when
the
moon
had
risen
behind
the
pointed
roofs
of
the
old
houses
and
the
tiny
stones
that
paved
the
street
could
be
distinctly
seen
in
its
still
beams
I
liked
wandering
about
the
town
at
that
time
the
moon
seemed
to
keep
a
steady
watch
on
it
from
the
clear
sky
and
the
town
was
aware
of
this
steady
gaze
and
stood
quiet
and
attentive
bathed
in
the
moonlight
that
peaceful
light
which
is
yet
softly
exciting
to
the
soul
The
cock
on
the
tall
Gothic
bell-tower
gleamed
a
pale
gold
the
same
gold
sheen
glimmered
in
waves
over
the
black
surface
of
the
stream
slender
candles
the
German
is
a
thrifty
soul
twinkled
modestly
in
the
narrow
windows
under
the
slate
roofs
branches
of
vine
thrust
out
their
twining
tendrils
mysteriously
from
behind
stone
walls
something
flitted
into
the
shade
by
the
old-fashioned
well
in
the
three-cornered
market
place
the
drowsy
whistle
of
the
night
watchman
broke
suddenly
on
the
silence
a
good-natured
dog
gave
a
subdued
growl
while
the
air
simply
caressed
the
face
and
the
lime-trees
smelt
so
sweet
that
unconsciously
the
lungs
drew
in
deeper
and
deeper
breaths
of
it
and
the
name
Gretchen
hung
half
exclamation
half
question
on
the
lips
The
little
town
of
Z
lies
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
Rhine
I
used
often
to
walk
to
look
at
the
majestic
river
and
would
spend
long
hours
on
a
stone-seat
under
a
huge
solitary
ash-tree
musing
not
without
some
mental
effort
on
the
faithless
widow
A
little
statue
of
a
Madonna
with
an
almost
childish
face
and
a
red
heart
pierced
with
swords
on
her
bosom
peeped
mournfully
out
of
the
branches
of
the
ash-tree
On
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
was
the
little
town
L
somewhat
larger
than
that
in
which
I
had
taken
up
my
quarters
One
evening
I
was
sitting
on
my
favourite
seat
gazing
at
the
sky
the
river
and
the
vineyards
In
front
of
me
flaxen-headed
boys
were
scrambling
up
the
sides
of
a
boat
that
had
been
pulled
ashore
and
turned
with
its
tarred
bottom
upwards
Sailing-boats
moved
slowly
by
with
slightly
dimpling
sails
the
greenish
waters
glided
by
swelling
and
faintly
rumbling
All
of
a
sudden
sounds
of
music
drifted
across
to
me
I
listened
A
waltz
was
being
played
in
the
town
of
L
The
double
bass
boomed
spasmodically
the
sound
of
the
fiddle
floated
across
indistinctly
now
and
then
the
flute
was
tootling
briskly
What
s
that
I
inquired
of
an
old
man
who
came
up
to
me
in
a
plush
waistcoat
blue
stockings
and
shoes
with
buckles
That
he
replied
after
first
shifting
his
pipe
from
one
corner
of
his
mouth
to
the
other
is
the
students
come
over
from
B
to
a
commersh
I
ll
have
a
look
at
this
commersh
I
thought
I
ve
never
been
over
to
L
either
I
sought
out
a
ferryman
and
went
over
to
the
other
side
Every
one
perhaps
may
not
know
what
such
a
commersh
is
It
is
a
solemn
festival
of
a
special
sort
at
which
students
meet
together
who
are
of
one
district
or
brotherhood
Landsmannschaft
Almost
all
who
take
part
in
the
commersh
wear
the
time-honoured
costume
of
German
students
Hungarian
jackets
big
boots
and
little
caps
with
bands
round
them
of
certain
colours
The
students
generally
assemble
to
a
dinner
presided
over
by
their
senior
member
and
they
keep
up
the
festivities
till
morning
drinking
singing
songs
Landesvater
Gaudeamus
etc
smoking
and
reviling
the
Philistines
Sometimes
they
hire
an
orchestra
Just
such
a
commersh
was
going
on
in
L
in
front
of
a
little
inn
with
the
sign
of
the
Sun
in
the
garden
looking
on
to
the
street
Flags
were
flying
over
the
inn
and
over
the
garden
the
students
were
sitting
at
tables
under
the
pollard
lime-trees
a
huge
bull-dog
was
lying
under
one
of
the
tables
on
one
side
in
an
ivy-covered
arbour
were
the
musicians
playing
away
zealously
and
continually
invigorating
themselves
with
beer
A
good
many
people
had
collected
in
the
street
before
the
low
garden
wall
the
worthy
citizens
of
L
could
not
let
slip
a
chance
of
staring
at
visitors
I
too
mingled
in
the
crowd
of
spectators
I
enjoyed
watching
the
students
faces
their
embraces
exclamations
the
innocent
affectations
of
youth
the
fiery
glances
the
laughter
without
cause
the
sweetest
laughter
in
the
world
all
this
joyous
effervescence
of
young
fresh
life
this
eager
pushing
forward
anywhere
so
long
as
it
s
forward
the
simple-hearted
freedom
moved
me
and
stirred
me
Couldn
t
I
join
them
I
was
wondering
Acia
have
you
had
enough
of
it
I
heard
a
man
s
voice
say
suddenly
in
Russian
just
behind
me
Let
s
stay
a
little
longer
answered
another
voice
a
woman
s
in
the
same
language
I
turned
quickly
round
My
eyes
fell
on
a
handsome
young
man
in
a
peaked
cap
and
a
loose
short
jacket
He
had
on
his
arm
a
young
girl
not
very
tall
wearing
a
straw
hat
which
concealed
all
the
upper
part
of
her
face
You
are
Russians
fell
involuntarily
from
my
lips
The
young
man
smiled
and
answered
Yes
we
are
Russians
I
never
expected
in
such
an
out
of
the
way
place
I
was
beginning
Nor
did
we
he
interrupted
me
Well
so
much
the
better
Let
me
introduce
myself
My
name
s
Gagin
and
this
is
my
he
hesitated
for
an
instant
my
sister
What
is
your
name
may
I
ask
I
told
him
my
name
and
we
got
into
conversation
I
found
out
that
Gagin
was
travelling
like
me
for
his
amusement
that
he
had
arrived
a
week
before
at
L
and
was
staying
on
there
To
tell
the
truth
I
was
not
eager
to
make
friends
with
Russians
abroad
I
used
to
recognise
them
a
long
way
off
by
their
walk
the
cut
of
their
clothes
and
most
of
all
by
the
expression
of
their
faces
which
was
self-complacent
and
supercilious
often
imperious
but
would
all
of
a
sudden
change
and
give
place
to
an
expression
of
shyness
and
cautiousness
The
whole
man
would
suddenly
be
on
his
guard
his
eyes
would
shift
uneasily
Mercy
upon
us
Haven
t
I
said
something
silly
aren
t
they
laughing
at
me
those
restless
eyes
seem
to
ask
An
instant
later
and
haughtiness
has
regained
its
sway
over
the
physiognomy
varied
at
times
by
a
look
of
dull
blankness
Yes
I
avoided
Russians
but
I
liked
Gagin
at
once
There
are
faces
in
the
world
of
that
happy
sort
every
one
is
glad
to
look
at
them
as
though
they
warmed
or
soothed
one
in
some
way
Gagin
had
just
such
a
face
sweet
and
kind
with
large
soft
eyes
and
soft
curly
hair
He
spoke
in
such
a
way
that
even
if
you
did
not
see
his
face
you
could
tell
by
the
mere
sound
of
his
voice
that
he
was
smiling
The
girl
whom
he
had
called
his
sister
struck
me
at
the
first
glance
as
very
charming
There
was
something
individual
characteristic
in
the
lines
of
her
dark
round
face
with
its
small
fine
nose
almost
childish
cheeks
and
clear
black
eyes
She
was
gracefully
built
but
hardly
seemed
to
have
reached
her
full
development
yet
She
was
not
in
the
least
like
her
brother
Will
you
come
home
with
us
Gagin
said
to
me
I
think
we
ve
stared
enough
at
the
Germans
Our
fellows
to
be
sure
would
have
broken
the
windows
and
smashed
up
the
chairs
but
these
chaps
are
very
sedate
What
do
you
say
Acia
shall
we
go
home
The
girl
nodded
her
head
in
assent
We
live
outside
the
town
Gagin
continued
in
a
vineyard
in
a
lonely
little
house
high
up
It
s
delightful
there
you
ll
see
Our
landlady
promised
to
make
us
some
junket
It
will
soon
be
dark
now
and
you
had
much
better
cross
the
Rhine
by
moonlight
We
set
off
Through
the
low
gates
of
the
town
it
was
enclosed
on
all
sides
by
an
ancient
wall
of
cobble-stones
even
the
barbicans
had
not
all
fallen
into
ruins
at
that
time
we
came
out
into
the
open
country
and
after
walking
a
hundred
paces
beside
a
stone
wall
we
came
to
a
standstill
before
a
little
narrow
gate
Gagin
opened
it
and
led
us
along
a
steep
path
up
the
mountain-side
On
the
slopes
on
both
sides
was
the
vineyard
the
sun
had
just
set
and
a
delicate
rosy
flush
lay
on
the
green
vines
on
the
tall
poles
on
the
dry
earth
which
was
dotted
with
big
and
little
stones
and
on
the
white
wall
of
the
little
cottage
with
sloping
black
beams
and
four
bright
little
windows
which
stood
at
the
very
top
of
the
mountain
we
had
climbed
up
Here
is
our
house
cried
Gagin
directly
we
began
to
approach
the
cottage
and
here
s
the
landlady
bringing
in
the
junket
Guten
Abend
Madame
We
ll
come
in
to
supper
directly
but
first
he
added
look
round
isn
t
it
a
view
The
view
certainly
was
marvellous
The
Rhine
lay
at
our
feet
all
silvery
between
its
green
banks
in
one
place
it
glowed
with
the
purple
and
gold
of
the
sunset
The
little
town
nestling
close
to
the
river-bank
displayed
all
its
streets
and
houses
sloping
hills
and
meadows
ran
in
wide
stretches
in
all
directions
Below
it
was
fine
but
above
was
finer
still
I
was
specially
impressed
by
the
depth
and
purity
of
the
sky
the
radiant
transparency
of
the
atmosphere
The
fresh
light
air
seemed
softly
quivering
and
undulating
as
though
it
too
were
more
free
and
at
ease
on
the
heights
You
have
chosen
delightful
lodgings
I
observed
It
was
Acia
found
it
answered
Gagin
come
Acia
he
went
on
see
after
the
supper
Let
everything
be
brought
out
here
We
will
have
supper
in
the
open
air
We
can
hear
the
music
better
here
Have
you
ever
noticed
he
added
turning
to
me
a
waltz
is
often
poor
stuff
close
by
vulgar
coarse
music
but
in
the
distance
it
s
exquisite
it
fairly
stirs
every
romantic
chord
within
one
Acia
her
real
name
was
Anna
but
Gagin
called
her
Acia
and
you
must
let
me
do
the
same
went
into
the
house
and
soon
came
back
with
the
landlady
They
were
carrying
together
a
big
tray
with
a
bowl
of
junket
plates
spoons
sugar
fruit
and
bread
We
sat
down
and
began
supper
Acia
took
off
her
hat
her
black
hair
cropped
short
and
combed
like
a
boy
s
fell
in
thick
curls
on
her
neck
and
ears
At
first
she
was
shy
of
me
but
Gagin
said
to
her
Come
Acia
come
out
of
your
shell
he
won
t
bite
She
smiled
and
a
little
while
after
she
began
talking
to
me
of
her
own
accord
I
had
never
seen
such
a
restless
creature
She
did
not
sit
still
for
a
single
instant
she
got
up
ran
off
into
the
house
and
ran
back
again
hummed
in
an
undertone
