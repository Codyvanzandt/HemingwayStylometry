you
have
failed
to
grow
to
our
stature
To
us
such
things
are
vanities
Tools
of
an
altogether
different
kind
are
what
we
need
for
the
task
Consequently
I
repeat
that
though
a
fine
young
fellow
enough
you
are
also
just
a
little-minded
so-called
'liberal-minded
baritch
1
what
my
father
calls
a
'product
of
evolution
Evgenii
was
Arkady
's
sad
reply
we
are
parting
for
ever
yet
this
is
all
that
you
have
to
say
to
me
Bazarov
scratched
his
head
Something
else
I
could
say
Arkady
he
replied
But
I
will
not
say
that
something
it
would
savour
too
much
of
Romanticism
Get
married
as
soon
as
you
can
line
your
nest
and
beget
plenty
of
offspring
Nor
will
those
offspring
be
altogether
fools
seeing
that
they
will
be
born
in
due
season
and
not
when
you
and
I
were
My
horses
are
ready
and
I
must
depart
Of
the
rest
of
the
household
I
have
taken
leave
already
Shall
we
embrace
once
more
eh
The
tears
gushed
in
torrents
from
Arkady
's
eyes
as
he
flung
himself
upon
his
old
friend
and
mentor
Ah
youth
youth
commented
Bazarov
See
what
comes
of
being
young
But
before
long
I
know
Katerina
Sergievna
will
have
set
things
right
Yes
she
will
console
you
With
a
last
good-bye
he
mounted
the
travelling
cart
and
in
the
act
of
doing
so
pointed
to
a
pair
of
jackdaws
which
were
sitting
perched
upon
the
stable
roof
See
he
cried
There's
an
instructive
lesson
for
you
What
do
you
mean
queried
Arkady
What
was
Bazarov
's
ejaculation
Are
you
so
ignorant
of
or
so
forgetful
of
natural
history
as
not
to
know
that
the
jackdaw
is
the
most
respected
of
family
birds
Mark
the
good
example
before
you
Farewell
señor
And
with
a
clatter
the
cart
started
on
its
way
Nor
was
Bazarov
mistaken
for
even
before
nightfall
Arkady
deep
in
conversation
with
Katia
had
completely
forgotten
his
vanished
instructor
Moreover
already
the
young
fellow
was
beginning
to
play
second
fiddle
to
his
fiancée
which
circumstance
the
girl
on
realising
in
no
way
felt
surprised
at
So
it
was
arranged
that
on
the
following
day
he
should
depart
for
Marino
to
interview
his
father
and
in
the
meanwhile
Anna
Sergievna
having
no
desire
to
hamper
the
young
couple
merely
observed
such
a
show
of
propriety
as
involved
her
not
leaving
them
together
for
long
but
at
the
same
time
keeping
at
a
distance
the
Princess
who
since
the
tidings
of
the
impending
union
had
been
in
a
state
of
lachrymose
rancour
For
herself
Anna
Sergievna
had
at
first
feared
that
the
spectacle
of
the
young
people's
happiness
would
prove
too
much
for
her
but
now
the
contrary
proved
to
be
the
case
and
she
not
only
failed
to
feel
hurt
at
the
spectacle
but
even
found
that
it
interested
her
and
eventually
softened
her
a
consummation
which
brought
both
relief
and
regret
Bazarov
was
right
she
reflected
It
was
mere
curiosity
mere
love
of
ease
mere
egoism
mere
Children
is
love
an
empirical
sentiment
once
she
asked
of
Arkady
and
Katia
but
neither
of
the
pair
understood
her
meaning
Moreover
they
were
fighting
a
little
shy
of
her
since
they
could
not
altogether
forget
the
conversation
which
they
had
involuntarily
overheard
but
in
time
Anna
Sergievna
succeeded
in
overcoming
also
this
timidity
and
found
the
task
the
more
easy
to
perform
in
that
she
had
succeeded
also
in
overcoming
her
disappointment
1
A
small
squire
The
old
Bazarovs
delight
at
their
son
's
return
was
the
greater
in
that
the
event
was
so
unexpected
To
such
an
extent
did
Anna
Vlasievna
fuss
and
flounce
about
the
house
that
Vasili
Ivanitch
likened
her
to
a
hen
partridge
no
doubt
the
short
tail
of
her
blouse
did
impart
to
her
rather
a
bird-like
aspect
while
as
regards
Vasili
himself
he
grunted
and
sucked
the
amber
mouthpiece
of
his
pipe
and
grasping
the
shank
inverted
the
bowl
as
though
to
make
sure
that
it
was
secure
and
finally
parted
his
capacious
lips
and
gave
vent
to
a
noiseless
chuckle
I
am
going
to
spend
with
you
six
whole
weeks
said
Bazarov
But
I
desire
to
work
and
therefore
must
not
be
disturbed
Before
we
will
disturb
you
you
shall
forget
what
my
face
looks
like
replied
Vasili
Ivanitch
And
he
kept
his
word
for
after
allotting
his
son
the
study
he
not
only
remained
completely
out
of
sight
but
even
prevented
his
wife
from
manifesting
the
least
sign
of
tenderness
When
Evgenii
last
visited
us
he
said
to
her
you
and
I
proved
a
little
wearisome
so
this
time
we
must
be
more
discreet
Anna
Vlasievna
agreed
much
as
she
lost
by
the
arrangement
seeing
that
now
she
beheld
her
son
only
at
meal
times
and
feared
even
then
to
speak
to
him
Eniushenka
she
would
begin
then
before
he
had
had
time
to
raise
his
eyes
pluck
nervously
at
the
strings
of
her
cap
and
whisper
Oh
no
it
was
nothing
and
address
herself
instead
to
Vasili
Ivanitch
saying
for
instance
with
cheek
on
hand
as
usual
My
dear
which
would
our
darling
Eniusha
prefer
for
dinner
cabbage
soup
or
beef
with
horse-radish
And
when
Vasili
Ivanitch
would
reply
Why
should
you
not
ask
him
yourself
she
would
exclaim
Oh
no
for
that
might
vex
him
But
eventually
Bazarov
ceased
to
closet
himself
in
that
there
came
an
abatement
of
the
work
fever
and
to
it
succeeded
fits
of
depression
ennui
and
an
inordinate
restlessness
In
his
every
movement
there
began
to
loom
a
strange
discontent
from
his
gait
there
disappeared
its
old
firm
active
self-confidence
and
ceasing
to
indulge
in
solitary
rambles
he
took
to
cultivating
society
to
attending
tea
in
the
drawing-room
to
pacing
the
kitchen
garden
and
to
joining
Vasili
Ivanitch
in
a
silent
smoking
of
pipes
Nay
on
one
occasion
he
even
paid
Father
Alexis
a
visit
At
first
the
new
order
of
things
rejoiced
Vasili
Ivanitch
's
heart
but
that
joy
proved
short-lived
Though
I
could
not
say
why
Eniusha
makes
me
anxious
he
confided
to
his
spouse
Not
that
he
is
discontented
or
ill-tempered
such
things
would
not
have
mattered
rather
it
is
that
he
is
sad
and
brooding
and
never
opens
his
lips
Would
that
he
would
curse
you
and
me
for
instance
Also
he
is
thinner
nor
do
I
like
the
colour
of
his
face
O
God
whispered
the
old
woman
Yet
I
may
not
even
put
my
arms
around
his
neck
From
that
time
onwards
Vasili
Ivanitch
began
to
make
cautious
attempts
to
question
Bazarov
concerning
his
work
his
health
and
his
friend
Arkady
but
always
Bazarov
returned
reluctant
indifferent
replies
and
once
when
his
father
was
for
introducing
the
foregoing
topics
said
irritably
Why
are
you
for
ever
tiptoeing
around
me
Your
present
manner
is
even
worse
than
your
former
one
There
there
I
did
not
mean
anything
was
poor
Vasili
Ivanitch's
reply
Political
allusions
proved
equally
fruitless
For
instance
when
Vasili
Ivanitch
was
seeking
to
engage
his
son
's
interest
on
the
score
of
the
impending
emancipation
of
the
serfs
and
progress
in
general
the
other
muttered
carelessly
Yesterday
when
passing
through
the
courtyard
I
heard
some
peasant
lads
singing
not
one
of
the
good
old
songs
but
I
The
age
of
truth
is
coming
in
when
hearts
shall
glow
with
love
There
's
progress
for
you
Occasionally
Bazarov
would
repair
to
the
village
and
in
his
usual
bantering
fashion
enter
into
conversation
with
some
peasant
Well
he
said
to
a
muzhik
pray
expound
to
me
your
views
on
life
For
they
tell
me
that
in
you
lie
the
whole
strength
and
the
whole
future
of
Russia
that
you
are
going
to
begin
a
new
epoch
in
our
history
and
to
give
us
both
a
real
language
and
new
laws
The
peasant
made
no
reply
at
the
moment
Then
he
said
We
might
do
all
that
if
first
we
had
a
new
chapel
here
Tell
me
something
though
about
the
world
in
general
Bazarov
interrupted
The
world
stands
on
three
fishes
does
it
not
It
does
that
batiushka
the
peasant
replied
with
the
quiet
good-humoured
sweetness
of
the
patriarchal
age
But
above
it
stands
the
will
of
the
masters
The
baré
are
our
fathers
and
the
harder
the
barin
drives
the
better
for
the
muzhik
Shrugging
his
shoulders
contemptuously
at
this
statement
Bazarov
turned
away
while
the
peasant
slunk
off
homewards
What
did
he
say
asked
a
sullen-looking
middle-aged
peasant
who
had
been
standing
at
the
door
of
his
hut
during
the
course
of
the
foregoing
colloquy
Was
he
talking
of
arrears
of
taxes
Of
arrears
of
taxes
retorted
the
first
peasant
his
tone
now
containing
not
a
trace
of
its
late
patriarchal
sweetness
but
rather
a
note
of
purely
dry
contempt
He
was
chattering
just
for
chattering's
sake
he
likes
to
hear
his
own
tongue
wag
Do
not
all
of
us
know
what
a
barin
and
the
likes
of
him
are
good
for
Aye
agreed
the
second
peasant
whereafter
with
much
nodding
of
caps
and
gesticulating
of
fists
they
fell
to
discussing
their
own
affairs
and
requirements
So
alas
for
Bazarov
's
scornful
shrug
of
the
shoulders
And
alas
for
that
knowledge
of
the
way
in
which
the
peasant
should
be
talked
to
whereof
the
young
Nihilist
had
made
such
boast
when
disputing
with
Paul
Petrovitch
In
fact
never
had
it
dawned
upon
the
mind
of
the
self-confident
Bazarov
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
muzhik
he
was
no
better
than
a
pease-pudding
However
he
succeeded
in
discovering
for
himself
an
occupation
This
was
when
in
bandaging
a
peasant
's
leg
Vasili
Ivanitch
's
hands
shook
a
little
through
senility
and
his
son
hastened
to
his
assistance
and
from
that
time
forth
Bazarov
acted
as
Vasili
Ivanitch
's
partner
even
though
he
maintained
unabated
his
ridicule
both
of
the
remedies
which
he
himself
advised
and
of
the
father
who
hastened
to
put
them
into
practice
Yet
in
no
way
did
his
son
's
raillery
annoy
Vasili
Ivanitch
rather
it
heartened
the
old
man
Smoking
his
pipe
and
drawing
his
dirty
overall
in
to
his
waist
with
both
thumbs
he
would
listen
delightedly
to
the
scoffer
and
chuckle
and
show
his
blackened
teeth
the
more
in
proportion
as
the
sallies
contained
a
greater
measure
of
venom
Nay
stupid
or
simply
senseless
as
many
of
these
witticisms
were
he
would
frequently
catch
them
up
and
repeat
them
To
take
one
instance
he
for
several
days
in
succession
kept
assuring
every
one
in
the
village
and
in
the
town
that
we
call
this
the
nine
o'clock
office
the
sole
basis
being
the
fact
that
once
on
learning
of
his
Vasili
Ivanitch
's
habit
of
attending
Matins
Bazarov
had
made
use
of
the
phrase
in
question
Thank
God
Evgenii
has
ceased
to
mope
he
confided
in
a
whisper
to
his
wife
In
fact
you
should
have
heard
him
rating
me
to-day
Also
the
thought
that
he
had
such
an
assistant
in
his
labours
filled
the
old
man
with
pride
Yes
yes
he
would
say
as
he
handed
some
peasant
woman
in
a
man's
jacket
a
phial
of
medicinal
water
or
a
pot
of
cold
cream
you
ought
daily
to
thank
God
that
my
son
happens
to
be
staying
with
me
since
otherwise
you
could
not
possibly
have
been
treated
according
to
the
latest
and
most
scientific
methods
Do
you
understand
I
say
that
even
Napoleon
the
Emperor
of
the
French
has
not
at
his
disposal
a
better
physician
than
my
son
And
the
peasant
woman
who
had
come
it
may
be
to
complain
of
a
lifting
with
the
gripes
an
expression
which
probably
she
herself
could
not
have
explained
would
bow
then
proffer
the
three
or
four
eggs
which
would
be
tied
up
in
a
corner
of
her
neckcloth
Also
when
Bazarov
extracted
a
tooth
from
the
jaw
of
a
travelling
pedlar
Vasili
Ivanitch
could
not
allow
even
the
very
ordinary
character
of
the
tooth
to
prevent
him
from
preserving
it
as
a
rarity
and
showing
it
to
Father
Alexis
See
what
a
fang
he
said
And
to
think
of
the
strength
which
Evgenii
must
possess
He
lifted
the
pedlar
clean
from
the
ground
It
was
like
uprooting
an
oak
tree
Splendid
was
Father
Alexis
comment
he
knew
not
what
else
to
say
nor
for
that
matter
how
else
to
get
rid
of
the
enthusiastic
veteran
Lastly
there
was
an
occasion
when
a
peasant
from
a
neighbouring
village
brought
his
brother
to
be
treated
Suffering
from
typhus
the
patient
was
lying
face
downwards
on
the
straw
in
the
cart
and
had
reached
the
last
stage
since
already
his
body
was
covered
with
spots
of
a
hectic
nature
and
he
had
long
lost
consciousness
To
an
expression
of
regret
that
resort
had
not
sooner
been
had
to
medical
aid
Vasili
Ivanitch
could
add
no
more
than
an
intimation
that
no
hope
was
left
nor
was
he
wrong
seeing
that
even
before
the
peasant
succeeded
in
conveying
his
brother
back
to
the
village
the
sick
man
had
breathed
his
last
Three
days
later
Bazarov
entered
his
father
's
room
with
an
inquiry
for
some
hell-stone
I
have
some
said
Vasili
Ivanitch
but
what
do
you
want
it
for
For
the
cauterisation
of
a
wound
A
wound
on
whom
A
wound
on
myself
On
yourself
Let
me
see
the
place
Where
is
it
There
on
that
finger
To-day
I
went
to
the
village
whence
they
brought
the
typhus
patient
the
other
day
and
though
they
tried
to
conceal
the
body
I
succeeded
in
discovering
it
Not
for
a
long
time
had
I
had
a
chance
of
doing
that
sort
of
work
Yes
And
the
sequel
was
that
I
cut
myself
and
on
repairing
to
the
district
physician
found
that
he
did
not
possess
what
I
wanted
Vasili
Ivanitch
went
white
to
the
lips
Hurrying
without
a
word
into
his
study
he
returned
thence
with
some
hell-stone
Bazarov
was
for
carrying
it
away
forthwith
No
no
cried
Vasili
Ivanitch
For
God
's
sake
allow
me
to
see
to
this
in
person
Bazarov
smiled
You
are
indeed
a
keen
practitioner
he
commented
Do
not
jest
I
beg
of
you
Show
me
the
finger
No
it
is
not
a
large
wound
Am
I
hurting
it
at
all
Not
in
the
least
Have
no
fear
You
can
press
it
harder
still
if
you
like
Vasili
Ivanitch
paused
Do
you
not
think
he
said
that
it
would
be
better
to
cauterise
the
finger
with
an
iron
No
I
do
not
Moreover
that
ought
in
any
case
to
have
been
done
sooner
whereas
by
now
even
the
hell-stone
is
unlikely
to
prove
effectual
seeing
that
as
you
know
once
absorbed
into
the
system
the
germ
renders
all
remedies
too
late
How
'too
late
gasped
Vasili
Ivanitch
What
I
say
Four
hours
have
elapsed
since
the
injury
Vasili
Ivanitch
gave
the
wound
a
further
cauterisation
So
the
district
physician
had
no
hell-stone
he
queried
None
God
in
heaven
To
think
of
that
man
calling
himself
a
doctor
yet
being
without
such
an
indispensable
remedy
You
should
have
seen
his
lancets
remarked
Bazarov
Then
he
left
the
room
Throughout
that
evening
and
the
next
few
days
Vasili
Ivanitch
kept
making
every
possible
excuse
to
enter
his
son
's
room
and
though
he
never
actually
referred
to
the
wound
he
even
strove
to
confine
his
conversation
to
purely
extraneous
subjects
his
observation
of
his
son
remained
so
persistent
his
solicitude
so
marked
that
at
length
Bazarov
losing
patience
bade
him
begone
Of
course
Vasili
Ivanitch
promised
not
to
repeat
the
intrusion
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
kept
this
promise
the
more
religiously
in
that
Arina
Vlasievna
who
had
had
the
matter
carefully
concealed
from
her
was
beginning
to
scent
something
in
the
wind
and
to
press
for
reasons
why
during
the
previous
night
her
husband
had
never
once
closed
his
eyes
Accordingly
for
the
next
two
days
Vasili
Ivanitch
faithfully
observed
the
undertaking
he
had
given
and
that
although
the
covert
observation
of
his
son
's
looks
which
he
maintained
showed
them
to
be
growing
by
no
means
to
his
liking
but
on
the
third
day
during
dinner
Vasili
Ivanitch
could
bear
it
no
more
for
Bazarov
was
sitting
with
his
eyes
lowered
and
his
plate
empty
You
are
eating
nothing
Evgenii
he
said
with
his
face
composed
to
express
absolute
indifference
In
my
opinion
the
dinner
is
well
cooked
The
only
reason
why
I
am
eating
nothing
replied
Bazarov
is
that
I
am
not
hungry
You
have
no
appetite
the
old
man
queried
timidly
Also
is
is
your
head
aching
at
all
Yes
Why
should
it
not
ache
Arina
Vlasievna
began
to
prick
up
her
ears
Do
not
be
angry
Evgenii
Vasili
Ivanitch
continued
b-but
might
I
feel
your
pulse
and
examine
you
Bazarov
looked
at
him
You
need
not
feel
my
pulse
he
said
Without
that
I
can
tell
that
I
have
a
touch
of
fever
You
feel
shivery
eh
Yes
I
think
I
will
go
and
lie
down
Pray
make
me
a
little
lime-juice
tea
for
I
seem
to
have
caught
a
chill
Yes
Arina
Vlasievna
put
in
I
heard
you
coughing
last
night
But
it
is
only
a
chill
added
Bazarov
and
left
the
room
So
Arina
Vlasievna
set
to
work
to
make
the
lime-juice
tea
and
Vasili
Ivanitch
went
into
an
adjoining
room
and
tore
his
hair
Bazarov
did
not
get
up
again
that
day
but
passed
the
night
in
a
state
of
heavy
coma
At
one
o'clock
he
opened
his
eyes
with
an
effort
and
on
seeing
his
father
's
pale
face
in
the
lamp-light
bade
him
depart
At
once
the
other
excused
himself
for
the
intrusion
but
nevertheless
returned
on
tiptoe
and
concealing
himself
behind
the
open
doors
of
a
cupboard
remained
there
to
watch
his
son
Nor
did
Arina
Vlasievna
go
to
bed
but
at
intervals
set
the
study
door
ajar
in
order
that
she
might
see
how
our
Eniusha
was
sleeping
and
look
at
Vasili
Ivanitch
for
though
nothing
of
the
latter
was
to
be
discerned
except
a
bowed
motionless
back
even
that
much
afforded
her
a
little
comfort
In
the
morning
Bazarov
attempted
to
rise
but
his
head
swam
and
blood
gushed
from
his
nose
so
he
desisted
from
the
attempt
In
silence
Vasili
Ivanitch
tended
him
and
Arina
Vlasievna
came
to
ask
him
how
he
felt
He
replied
Better
then
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
Instantly
Vasili
Ivanitch
fell
to
gesticulating
violently
at
his
wife
with
both
hands
which
proceeding
proved
so
far
successful
that
by
dint
of
biting
her
lips
Arina
Vlasievna
contrived
to
force
back
the
tears
and
leave
the
room
Of
a
sudden
everything
in
the
house
had
seemed
to
turn
dark
Everywhere
faces
looked
drawn
and
everywhere
there
was
to
be
observed
a
curious
stillness
of
which
one
cause
among
others
was
the
fact
that
there
had
hastily
been
removed
from
the
courtyard
of
the
village
a
vociferous
cock
which
no
reasoning
had
been
able
to
convince
of
the
necessity
of
silence
So
Bazarov
continued
lying
with
his
face
to
the
wall
Once
or
twice
Vasili
Ivanitch
essayed
a
tentative
question
or
two
but
the
attempt
only
wearied
Bazarov
and
the
old
man
at
length
subsided
into
an
armchair
and
sat
nervously
twitching
his
fingers
Next
Vasili
repaired
to
the
garden
for
a
few
minutes
and
looked
as
he
stood
there
like
a
statue
which
has
been
struck
with
immeasurable
astonishment
never
at
any
time
was
the
expression
of
surprise
absent
from
his
features
whereafter
he
returned
to
his
son
's
room
in
the
hope
of
evading
questions
on
the
part
of
his
wife
but
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
grimly
almost
threateningly
asked
What
is
the
matter
with
our
Eniusha
and
when
Vasili
strove
to
pull
himself
together
and
to
force
a
smile
there
issued
to
his
horror
not
a
smile
at
all
but
a
sort
of
irresponsible
laugh
Earlier
in
the
morning
he
had
sent
for
a
doctor
to
assist
him
wherefore
he
now
considered
that
it
would
be
well
to
advise
his
son
of
the
fact
lest
Bazarov
should
lose
his
temper
on
discovering
the
fact
in
question
for
himself
Vasili
Ivanitch
explained
the
situation
and
then
Bazarov
turned
himself
about
on
the
sofa
gazed
at
his
father
for
a
moment
or
two
and
asked
to
be
given
something
to
drink
Vasili
Ivanitch
handed
him
some
water
and
seized
the
opportunity
also
to
feel
his
son
's
forehead
It
seemed
to
be
on
fire
My
father
said
Bazarov
in
a
hoarse
dragging
voice
I
fear
that
my
course
is
run
The
infection
has
caught
me
and
in
a
few
days
you
will
be
laying
me
in
my
grave
Some
one
might
have
thrust
Vasili
Ivanitch
violently
backwards
so
sharply
did
he
stagger
Evgenii
he
gasped
why
say
that
God
have
you
in
his
keeping
It
is
merely
that
you
have
caught
a
chill
Come
come
interrupted
Bazarov
but
in
the
same
dragging
tone
as
before
It
is
useless
to
talk
like
that
to
a
doctor
All
the
signs
of
infection
are
present
That
you
know
for
yourself
But
but
where
are
the
signs
of
of
infection
Look
at
these
What
do
they
mean
And
Bazarov
pulled
up
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt
What
he
showed
his
father
was
a
number
of
red
angry-looking
patches
that
were
coming
into
view
Vasili
Ivanitch
started
and
turned
cold
with
fear
At
length
he
contrived
to
stammer
out
Yet
even
supposing
that
that
there
should
be
anything
in
the
nature
of
infection
Of
pyæmia
you
mean
the
son
prompted
Anything
in
the
nature
of
epidemic
infec
Of
pyæmia
I
repeat
grimly
insistently
corrected
Bazarov
Have
you
forgotten
your
textbooks
Yes
well
have
it
your
own
way
But
we
will
cure
you
all
the
same
Fiddlesticks
But
apart
from
that
question
I
had
scarcely
looked
to
die
so
soon
To
be
frank
I
think
it
hard
upon
me
And
now
you
and
my
mother
must
fall
back
upon
the
fund
of
religious
strength
which
lies
within
you
The
hour
to
put
it
to
the
test
has
arrived
He
drank
some
more
water
One
particular
request
I
desire
to
make
while
my
brain
is
yet
clear
for
by
to-morrow
or
the
day
after
it
will
as
you
know
have
failed
and
even
now
I
am
not
sure
whether
I
am
expressing
myself
sensibly
seeing
that
as
I
was
lying
here
just
now
I
seemed
to
see
a
pack
of
red
dogs
leaping
around
me
and
yourself
making
a
point
at
me
as
a
dog
does
at
a
partridge
Yes
it
was
like
being
drunk
Can
you
understand
what
I
say
Yes
yes
Evgenii
you
are
talking
quite
sensibly
Very
well
Now
I
believe
that
you
have
sent
for
a
doctor
and
if
the
fact
will
give
you
any
comfort
I
too
shall
be
pleased
But
also
I
beg
that
you
will
send
word
to
to
To
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
the
old
man
suggested
To
whom
To
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
re-echoed
Bazarov
bewilderedly
Oh
you
mean
that
young
cockerel
of
ours
No
no
do
not
disturb
him
for
he
has
just
joined
the
company
of
the
jackdaws
You
need
not
be
surprised
at
these
words
they
do
not
mean
that
delirium
is
setting
in
they
are
merely
a
metaphor
Well
it
is
to
Madame
Odintsov
the
lady
landowner
of
this
neighbourhood
that
I
desire
a
messenger
to
be
sent
I
suppose
you
have
heard
of
her
Vasili
Ivanitch
nodded
assent
All
that
the
messenger
need
say
is
that
Evgenii
Vasilitch
sends
his
compliments
and
is
dying
Will
you
do
this
Of
course
I
will
Evgenii
But
why
think
that
you
are
going
to
die
Come
come
Were
such
a
thing
to
happen
where
would
be
the
justice
of
the
world
I
could
not
say
I
only
know
that
I
desire
the
messenger
to
be
sent
He
shall
start
at
once
and
I
myself
will
write
the
letter
No
no
that
will
not
be
necessary
Merely
let
the
messenger
deliver
my
greeting
That
and
nothing
more
Now
I
will
return
to
my
red
dogs
How
curious
it
is
that
though
I
strive
to
concentrate
my
thoughts
upon
death
there
results
from
them
nothing
I
see
before
me
only
a
great
blur
And
he
turned
his
face
wearily
to
the
wall
while
Vasili
Ivanitch
left
the
room
ascended
to
the
bedroom
above
and
fell
upon
his
knees
before
the
sacred
ikons
Pray
Arina
pray
he
moaned
Our
son
is
dying
On
the
doctor
arriving
the
latter
proved
to
be
the
district
physician
who
had
failed
to
produce
hell-stone
when
required
After
an
examination
of
the
patient
he
prescribed
a
watching
course
and
also
added
a
few
words
as
to
a
possible
recovery
Have
you
ever
known
people
in
my
condition
not
set
out
for
the
Elysian
Fields
asked
Bazarov
sharply
as
he
caught
hold
of
the
leg
of
a
table
which
stood
beside
his
sofa
and
shook
it
until
the
table
actually
altered
its
position
See
my
strength
he
continued
All
of
it
is
still
there
yet
I
must
go
hence
To
think
that
whereas
an
old
man
has
lost
touch
with
life
I
should
Ah
however
much
you
may
deny
death
it
never
will
deny
you
I
hear
some
one
weeping
Who
is
it
There
was
a
pause
Is
it
my
mother
Poor
soul
No
one
will
be
left
for
her
to
stuff
with
her
marvellous
borstchi
1
And
you
Vasili
Ivanitch
are
you
too
whimpering
Come
come
If
Christianity
can
not
help
you
try
to
become
a
Stoic
philosopher
You
have
often
enough
boasted
of
being
one
Aye
a
fine
philosopher
I
to
be
sure
sobbed
poor
old
Vasili
with
the
tears
hopping
down
his
cheeks
Thereafter
Bazarov
grew
hourly
worse
for
the
disease
was
taking
the
rapid
course
inevitable
under
the
circumstances
Yet
his
powers
of
memory
were
unimpaired
and
he
understood
everything
that
was
said
to
him
for
as
yet
he
was
making
a
brave
fight
to
retain
his
faculties
No
I
must
not
let
my
senses
fail
he
kept
whispering
to
himself
as
he
clenched
his
fists
But
oh
the
folly
of
it
all
And
then
he
would
repeat
to
himself
over
and
over
again
some
such
formula
as
Eight
and
ten
what
do
they
make
Meanwhile
Vasili
Ivanitch
wandered
about
in
a
state
bordering
upon
distraction
proposing
first
one
remedy
and
then
another
and
constantly
covering
up
his
son
's
feet
Suppose
we
wrap
him
in
an
ice-sheet
he
suggested
once
in
a
tone
of
agony
How
too
about
an
emetic
or
a
mustard
plaster
on
his
stomach
or
a
little
bloodletting
But
to
each
and
all
of
these
remedies
the
doctor
whom
Vasili
Ivanitch
had
begged
to
remain
in
the
house
demurred
Likewise
the
doctor
drank
the
patient
's
lemonade
and
then
requested
to
be
given
a
pipe
and
something
warm
and
strengthening
to
wit
a
glassful
of
vodka
Meanwhile
Arina
Vlasievna
sat
on
a
chair
by
the
door
and
only
at
intervals
retired
to
pray
It
seemed
that
a
few
days
earlier
she
had
let
fall
and
broken
a
toilet
mirror
and
that
all
her
life
long
she
had
looked
upon
such
an
occurrence
as
an
evil
omen
With
her
in
silence
sat
Anfisushka
while
as
for
Timotheitch
he
had
departed
with
the
message
to
Madame
Odintsov
That
night
Bazarov
did
not
improve
for
he
was
racked
with
high
fever
but
as
morning
approached
the
fever
grew
a
little
easier
and
after
he
had
asked
Arina
Vlasievna
to
perform
his
toilet
and
had
kissed
her
hand
he
managed
to
swallow
a
little
tea
which
circumstance
caused
Vasili
Ivanitch
to
pluck
up
courage
and
to
exclaim
Thank
God
the
crisis
has
both
come
and
gone
Do
not
be
too
sure
of
that
rejoined
Bazarov
For
what
does
the
term
'crisis
signify
Some
one
once
invented
it
shouted
'Crisis
and
congratulated
himself
ever
after
Extraordinary
how
the
human
race
continues
to
attach
credence
to
mere
words
For
example
tell
a
man
that
he
is
a
fool
yet
refrain
from
assaulting
him
and
he
will
be
downcast
but
tell
him
that
he
is
a
man
of
wisdom
yet
give
him
no
money
and
he
will
be
overjoyed
So
reminiscent
of
Bazarov
's
former
sallies
was
this
little
speech
that
Vasili
Ivanitch
's
heart
fairly
overflowed
Bravo
he
cried
clapping
his
hands
in
dumb
show
Well
said
Bazarov
smiled
a
sad
smile
Then
you
think
said
he
that
the
'crisis
is
either
approaching
or
retiring
I
know
that
you
are
better
That
I
can
see
for
myself
And
the
fact
rejoices
me
Well
it
is
not
always
a
bad
thing
to
rejoice
But
have
you
sent
word
to
to
to
her
You
know
whom
I
mean
Of
course
I
have
Evgenii
The
improvement
did
not
long
continue
for
to
it
there
succeeded
attacks
of
pain
Vasili
Ivanitch
sat
by
the
bed
and
as
he
did
so
it
seemed
as
though
something
in
particular
were
worrying
the
old
man
Several
times
he
tried
to
speak
and
each
time
he
failed
But
at
length
he
contrived
to
gasp
out
Evgenii
Son
My
dearest
son
My
own
beloved
son
Even
Bazarov
could
not
remain
wholly
indifferent
to
such
an
unwonted
appeal
Turning
his
head
a
little
and
making
an
evident
effort
to
shake
off
the
unconsciousness
that
was
weighing
him
down
he
murmured
What
is
it
my
father
This
Evgenii
And
all
of
a
sudden
the
old
man
fell
upon
his
knees
beside
the
bed
Evgenii
you
are
better
now
and
with
God
's
help
will
recover
but
do
in
any
case
seize
this
hour
to
comfort
me
and
your
mother
by
fulfilling
all
the
duties
of
a
Christian
Yes
though
to
say
this
is
painful
for
me
how
much
more
terribly
would
it
hurt
me
if
if
this
chance
were
to
pass
for
ever
Evgenii
Think
oh
think
of
what
The
old
man
could
say
no
