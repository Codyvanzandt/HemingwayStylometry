creature
lying
on
the
ground
hurriedly
jumped
on
to
its
feet
and
running
up
to
Tchertop-hanov
convulsively
seized
hold
of
the
edge
of
the
saddle
'Alive
was
heard
in
the
background
'He
's
a
regular
cat
'Your
ex-shelency
defend
me
save
me
the
unhappy
Jew
was
faltering
meanwhile
his
whole
body
squeezed
up
against
Tchertop-hanov
's
foot
'or
they
will
murder
me
they
will
murder
me
your
ex-shelency
'What
have
they
against
you
asked
Tchertop-hanov
'I
ca
n't
tell
so
help
me
God
Some
cow
hereabouts
died
so
they
suspect
me
but
I
'Well
that
we
'll
go
into
later
Tchertop-hanov
interrupted
'but
now
you
hold
on
to
the
saddle
and
follow
me
And
you
he
added
turning
to
the
crowd
do
you
know
me
I
'm
the
landowner
Panteley
Tchertop-hanov
I
live
at
Bezsonovo
and
so
you
can
take
proceedings
against
me
when
you
think
fit
and
against
the
Jew
too
while
you
're
about
it
'Why
take
proceedings
said
a
grey-bearded
decent-looking
peasant
bowing
low
the
very
picture
of
an
ancient
patriarch
He
had
been
no
whit
behind
the
others
in
belabouring
the
Jew
however
'We
know
your
honour
Panteley
Eremyitch
well
we
thank
your
honour
humbly
for
teaching
us
better
'Why
take
proceedings
chimed
in
the
others
'As
to
the
Jew
we
'll
take
it
out
of
him
another
day
He
wo
n't
escape
us
We
shall
be
on
the
look-out
for
him
Tchertop-hanov
pulled
his
moustaches
snorted
and
went
home
at
a
walking
pace
accompanied
by
the
Jew
whom
he
had
delivered
from
his
persecutors
just
as
he
had
once
delivered
Tihon
Nedopyuskin
A
few
days
later
the
one
groom
who
was
left
to
Tchertop-hanov
announced
that
someone
had
come
on
horseback
and
wanted
to
speak
to
him
Tchertop-hanov
went
out
on
to
the
steps
and
recognised
the
Jew
riding
a
splendid
horse
of
the
Don
breed
which
stood
proud
and
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
The
Jew
was
bareheaded
he
held
his
cap
under
his
arm
and
had
thrust
his
feet
into
the
stirrup-straps
not
into
the
stirrups
themselves
the
ragged
skirts
of
his
long
coat
hung
down
on
both
sides
of
the
saddle
On
seeing
Tchertop-hanov
he
gave
a
smack
with
his
lips
and
ducked
down
with
a
twitch
of
the
elbows
and
a
bend
of
the
legs
Tchertop-hanov
however
not
only
failed
to
respond
to
his
greeting
but
was
even
enraged
by
it
he
was
all
on
fire
in
a
minute
a
scurvy
Jew
dare
to
ride
a
magnificent
horse
like
that
It
was
positively
indecent
'Hi
you
Ethiopian
fright
he
shouted
'get
off
at
once
if
you
don't
want
to
be
flung
off
into
the
mud
The
Jew
promptly
obeyed
rolled
off
the
horse
like
a
sack
and
keeping
hold
of
the
rein
with
one
hand
he
approached
Tchertop-hanov
smiling
and
bowing
'What
do
you
want
Panteley
Eremyitch
inquired
with
dignity
'Your
ex-shelency
deign
to
look
what
a
horse
said
the
Jew
never
ceasing
to
bow
for
an
instant
'Er
well
the
horse
is
all
right
Where
did
you
get
it
from
Stole
it
I
suppose
'How
can
you
say
that
your
ex-shelency
I
'm
an
honest
Jew
I
didn't
steal
it
but
I
obtained
it
for
your
ex-shelency
really
And
the
trouble
the
trouble
I
had
to
get
it
But
then
see
what
a
horse
it
is
There
's
not
another
horse
like
it
to
be
found
in
all
the
Don
country
Look
your
ex-shelency
what
a
horse
it
is
Here
kindly
step
this
way
Wo
wo
turn
round
stand
sideways
And
we
'll
take
off
the
saddle
What
do
you
think
of
him
your
ex-shelency
'The
horse
is
all
right
repeated
Tchertop-hanov
with
affected
indifference
though
his
heart
was
beating
like
a
sledge-hammer
in
his
breast
He
was
a
passionate
lover
of
'horse-flesh
and
knew
a
good
thing
when
he
saw
it
'Only
take
a
look
at
him
your
ex-shelency
Pat
him
on
the
neck
yes
yes
he-he-he-he
like
this
like
this
Tchertop-hanov
with
apparent
reluctance
laid
his
hand
on
the
horse's
neck
gave
it
a
pat
or
two
then
passed
his
fingers
from
the
forelock
along
the
spine
and
when
he
had
reached
a
certain
spot
above
the
kidneys
like
a
connoisseur
he
lightly
pressed
that
spot
The
horse
instantly
arched
its
spine
and
looking
round
suspiciously
at
Tchertop-hanov
with
its
haughty
black
eye
snorted
and
moved
its
hind
legs
The
Jew
laughed
and
faintly
clapped
his
hands
'He
knows
his
master
your
ex-shelency
his
master
'Do
n't
talk
nonsense
Tchertop-hanov
interrupted
with
vexation
'To
buy
this
horse
from
you
I
have
n't
the
means
and
as
for
presents
I
not
only
would
n't
take
them
from
a
Jew
I
would
n't
take
a
present
from
Almighty
God
Himself
'As
though
I
would
presume
to
offer
you
a
present
mercy
upon
me
cried
the
Jew
'you
buy
it
your
ex-shelency
and
as
to
the
little
sum
I
can
wait
for
it
Tchertop-hanov
sank
into
thought
'What
will
you
take
for
it
he
muttered
at
last
between
his
teeth
The
Jew
shrugged
his
shoulders
'What
I
paid
for
it
myself
Two
hundred
roubles
The
horse
was
well
worth
twice
perhaps
even
three
times
that
sum
Tchertop-hanov
turned
away
and
yawned
feverishly
'And
the
money
when
he
asked
scowling
furiously
and
not
looking
at
the
Jew
'When
your
ex-shelency
thinks
fit
Tchertop-hanov
flung
his
head
back
but
did
not
raise
his
eyes
'That's
no
answer
Speak
plainly
son
of
Herod
Am
I
to
be
under
an
obligation
to
you
hey
'Well
let
's
say
then
the
Jew
hastened
to
add
'in
six
months
time
Do
you
agree
Tchertop-hanov
made
no
reply
The
Jew
tried
to
get
a
look
at
his
face
'Do
you
agree
You
permit
him
to
be
led
to
your
stable
'The
saddle
I
do
n't
want
Tchertop-hanov
blurted
out
abruptly
'Take
the
saddle
do
you
hear
'To
be
sure
to
be
sure
I
will
take
it
faltered
the
delighted
Jew
shouldering
the
saddle
'And
the
money
Tchertop-hanov
pursued
'in
six
months
And
not
two
hundred
but
two
hundred
and
fifty
Not
a
word
Two
hundred
and
fifty
I
tell
you
to
my
account
Tchertop-hanov
still
could
not
bring
himself
to
raise
his
eyes
Never
had
his
pride
been
so
cruelly
wounded
'It
's
plain
it
's
a
present
was
the
thought
in
his
mind
'he
's
brought
it
out
of
gratitude
the
devil
And
he
would
have
liked
to
kiss
the
Jew
and
he
would
have
liked
to
beat
him
'Your
ex-shelency
began
the
Jew
gaining
a
little
courage
and
grinning
all
over
his
face
'should
after
the
Russian
fashion
take
from
hand
to
hand
'What
next
what
an
idea
A
Hebrew
and
Russian
customs
Hey
you
there
Take
the
horse
lead
him
to
the
stable
And
give
him
some
oats
I
'll
come
myself
and
look
after
him
And
his
name
is
to
be
Malek-Adel
Tchertop-hanov
turned
to
go
up
the
steps
but
turning
sharply
back
and
running
up
to
the
Jew
he
pressed
his
hand
warmly
The
latter
was
bending
down
to
kiss
his
hand
but
Tchertop-hanov
bounded
back
again
and
murmuring
'Tell
no
one
he
vanished
through
the
door
V
From
that
very
day
the
chief
interest
the
chief
occupation
the
chief
pleasure
in
the
life
of
Tchertop-hanov
was
Malek-Adel
He
loved
him
as
he
had
not
loved
even
Masha
he
became
more
attached
to
him
than
even
to
Nedopyuskin
And
what
a
horse
it
was
All
fire
simply
explosive
as
gunpowder
and
stately
as
a
boyar
Untiring
enduring
obedient
whatever
you
might
put
him
to
and
costing
nothing
for
his
keep
he
'd
be
ready
to
nibble
at
the
ground
under
his
feet
if
there
was
nothing
else
When
he
stepped
at
a
walking
pace
it
was
like
being
lulled
to
sleep
in
a
nurse
's
arms
when
he
trotted
it
was
like
rocking
at
sea
when
he
galloped
he
outstripped
the
wind
Never
out
of
breath
perfectly
sound
in
his
wind
Sinews
of
steel
for
him
to
stumble
was
a
thing
never
recorded
To
take
a
ditch
or
a
fence
was
nothing
to
him
and
what
a
clever
beast
At
his
master
's
voice
he
would
run
with
his
head
in
the
air
if
you
told
him
to
stand
still
and
walked
away
from
him
he
would
not
stir
directly
you
turned
back
a
faint
neigh
to
say
'Here
I
am
And
afraid
of
nothing
in
the
pitch-dark
in
a
snow-storm
he
would
find
his
way
and
he
would
not
let
a
stranger
come
near
him
for
anything
he
would
have
had
his
teeth
in
him
And
a
dog
dare
never
approach
him
he
would
have
his
fore-leg
on
his
head
in
a
minute
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
beast
A
horse
of
proper
pride
you
might
flourish
a
switch
over
him
as
an
ornament
but
God
forbid
you
touched
him
But
why
say
more
a
perfect
treasure
not
a
horse
If
Tchertop-hanov
set
to
describing
his
Malek-Adel
he
could
not
find
words
to
express
himself
And
how
he
petted
and
pampered
him
His
coat
shone
like
silver
not
old
but
new
silver
with
a
dark
polish
on
it
if
one
passed
one
's
hand
over
it
it
was
like
velvet
His
saddle
his
cloth
his
bridle
all
his
trappings
in
fact
were
so
well-fitted
in
such
good
order
so
bright
a
perfect
picture
Tchertop-hanov
himself
what
more
can
we
say
with
his
own
hands
plaited
his
favourite
's
forelocks
and
mane
and
washed
his
tail
with
beer
and
even
more
than
once
rubbed
his
hoofs
with
polish
Sometimes
he
would
mount
Malek-Adel
and
ride
out
not
to
see
his
neighbours
he
avoided
them
as
of
old
but
across
their
lands
past
their
homesteads
for
them
poor
fools
to
admire
him
from
a
distance
Or
he
would
hear
that
there
was
to
be
a
hunt
somewhere
that
a
rich
landowner
had
arranged
a
meet
in
some
outlying
part
of
his
land
he
would
be
off
there
at
once
and
would
canter
in
the
distance
on
the
horizon
astounding
all
spectators
by
the
swiftness
and
beauty
of
his
horse
and
not
letting
any
one
come
close
to
him
Once
some
hunting
landowner
even
gave
chase
to
him
with
all
his
suite
he
saw
Tchertop-hanov
was
getting
away
and
he
began
shouting
after
him
with
all
his
might
as
he
galloped
at
full
speed
'Hey
you
Here
Take
what
you
like
for
your
horse
I
would
n't
grudge
a
thousand
I
'd
give
my
wife
my
children
Take
my
last
farthing
Tchertop-hanov
suddenly
reined
in
Malek-Adel
The
hunting
gentleman
flew
up
to
him
'My
dear
sir
he
shouted
'tell
me
what
you
want
My
dear
friend
'If
you
were
the
Tsar
said
Tchertop-hanov
emphatically
and
he
had
never
heard
of
Shakespeare
'you
might
give
me
all
your
kingdom
for
my
horse
I
would
n't
take
it
He
uttered
these
words
chuckled
drew
Malek-Adel
up
on
to
his
haunches
turned
him
in
the
air
on
his
hind
legs
like
a
top
or
teetotum
and
off
He
went
like
a
flash
over
the
stubble
And
the
hunting
man
a
rich
prince
they
said
he
was
flung
his
cap
on
the
ground
threw
himself
down
with
his
face
in
his
cap
and
lay
so
for
half
an
hour
And
how
could
Tchertop-hanov
fail
to
prize
his
horse
Was
it
not
thanks
to
him
he
had
again
an
unmistakable
superiority
a
last
superiority
over
all
his
neighbours
Meanwhile
time
went
by
the
day
fixed
for
payment
was
approaching
while
far
from
having
two
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
Tchertop-hanov
had
not
even
fifty
What
was
to
be
done
how
could
it
be
met
'Well
he
decided
at
last
'if
the
Jew
is
relentless
if
he
wo
n't
wait
any
longer
I
'll
give
him
my
house
and
my
land
and
I
'll
set
off
on
my
horse
no
matter
where
I
'll
starve
before
I
'll
give
up
Malek-Adel
He
was
greatly
perturbed
and
even
downcast
but
at
this
juncture
Fate
for
the
first
and
last
time
was
pitiful
and
smiled
upon
him
some
distant
kinswoman
whose
very
name
was
unknown
to
Tchertop-hanov
left
him
in
her
will
a
sum
immense
in
his
eyes
no
less
than
two
thousand
roubles
And
he
received
this
sum
in
the
very
nick
as
they
say
of
time
the
day
before
the
Jew
was
to
come
Tchertop-hanov
almost
went
out
of
his
mind
with
joy
but
he
never
even
thought
of
vodka
from
the
very
day
Malek-Adel
came
into
his
hands
he
had
not
touched
a
drop
He
ran
into
the
stable
and
kissed
his
favourite
on
both
sides
of
his
face
above
the
nostrils
where
the
horse
's
skin
is
always
so
soft
'Now
we
shall
not
be
parted
he
cried
patting
Malek-Adel
on
the
neck
under
his
well-combed
mane
When
he
went
back
into
the
house
he
counted
out
and
sealed
up
in
a
packet
two
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
Then
as
he
lay
on
his
back
and
smoked
a
pipe
he
mused
on
how
he
would
lay
out
the
rest
of
the
money
what
dogs
he
would
procure
real
Kostroma
hounds
spot
and
tan
and
no
mistake
He
even
had
a
little
talk
with
Perfishka
to
whom
he
promised
a
new
Cossack
coat
with
yellow
braid
on
all
the
seams
and
went
to
bed
in
a
blissful
frame
of
mind
He
had
a
bad
dream
he
dreamt
he
was
riding
out
hunting
not
on
Malek-Adel
but
on
some
strange
beast
of
the
nature
of
a
unicorn
a
white
fox
white
as
snow
ran
to
meet
him
He
tried
to
crack
his
whip
tried
to
set
the
dogs
on
her
but
instead
of
his
riding-whip
he
found
he
had
a
wisp
of
bast
in
his
hand
and
the
fox
ran
in
front
of
him
putting
her
tongue
out
at
him
He
jumped
off
his
unicorn
stumbled
he
fell
and
fell
straight
into
the
arms
of
a
police-constable
who
was
taking
him
before
the
Governor-General
and
whom
he
recognised
as
Yaff
Tchertop-hanov
waked
up
The
room
was
dark
the
cocks
were
just
crowing
for
the
second
time
Somewhere
in
the
far
far
distance
a
horse
neighed
Tchertop-hanov
lifted
up
his
head
Once
more
a
faint
faint
neigh
was
heard
'That
's
Malek-Adel
neighing
was
his
thought
'It
's
his
neigh
But
why
so
far
away
Bless
us
and
save
us
It
ca
n't
be
Tchertop-hanov
suddenly
turned
chill
all
over
he
instantly
leaped
out
of
bed
fumbled
after
his
boots
and
his
clothes
dressed
himself
and
snatching
up
the
stable-door
key
from
under
his
pillow
he
dashed
out
into
the
courtyard
The
stable
was
at
the
very
end
of
the
courtyard
one
wall
faced
the
open
country
Tchertop-hanov
could
not
at
once
fit
the
key
into
the
lock
his
hands
were
shaking
and
he
did
not
immediately
turn
the
key
He
stood
motionless
holding
his
breath
if
only
something
would
stir
inside
'Malek
Malek
he
cried
in
a
low
voice
the
silence
of
death
Tchertop-hanov
unconsciously
jogged
the
key
the
door
creaked
and
opened
So
it
was
not
locked
He
stepped
over
the
threshold
and
again
called
his
horse
this
time
by
his
full
name
Malek-Adel
But
no
response
came
from
his
faithful
companion
only
a
mouse
rustled
in
the
straw
Then
Tchertop-hanov
rushed
into
one
of
the
three
horse-boxes
in
the
stable
in
which
Malek-Adel
was
put
He
went
straight
to
the
horse-box
though
it
was
pitch-dark
around
Empty
Tchertop-hanov's
head
went
round
it
seemed
as
though
a
bell
was
booming
in
his
brain
He
tried
to
say
something
but
only
brought
out
a
sort
of
hiss
and
fumbling
with
his
hands
above
below
on
all
sides
breathless
with
shaking
knees
he
made
his
way
from
one
horse-box
to
another
to
a
third
full
almost
to
the
top
with
hay
stumbled
against
one
wall
and
then
the
other
fell
down
rolled
over
on
his
head
got
up
and
suddenly
ran
headlong
through
the
half-open
door
into
the
courtyard
'Stolen
Perfishka
Perfishka
Stolen
he
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
voice
The
groom
Perfishka
flew
head-over-heels
out
of
the
loft
where
he
slept
with
only
his
shirt
on
Like
drunk
men
they
ran
against
one
another
the
master
and
his
solitary
servant
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
like
madmen
they
turned
round
each
other
The
master
could
not
explain
what
was
the
matter
nor
could
the
servant
make
out
what
was
wanted
of
him
'Woe
woe
wailed
Tchertop-hanov
'Woe
woe
the
groom
repeated
after
him
'A
lantern
here
light
a
lantern
Light
light
broke
at
last
from
Tchertop-hanov
's
fainting
lips
Perfishka
rushed
into
the
house
But
to
light
the
lantern
to
get
fire
was
not
easy
lucifer
matches
were
regarded
as
a
rarity
in
those
days
in
Russia
the
last
embers
had
long
ago
gone
out
in
the
kitchen
flint
and
steel
were
not
quickly
found
and
they
did
not
work
well
Gnashing
his
teeth
Tchertop-hanov
snatched
them
out
of
the
hands
of
the
flustered
Perfishka
and
began
striking
a
light
himself
the
sparks
fell
in
abundance
in
still
greater
abundance
fell
curses
and
even
groans
but
the
tinder
either
did
not
catch
or
went
out
again
in
spite
of
the
united
efforts
of
four
swollen
cheeks
and
lips
to
blow
it
into
a
flame
At
last
in
five
minutes
not
sooner
a
bit
of
tallow
candle
was
alight
at
the
bottom
of
a
battered
lantern
and
Tchertop-hanov
accompanied
by
Perfishka
dashed
into
the
stable
lifted
the
lantern
above
his
head
looked
round
All
empty
He
bounded
out
into
the
courtyard
ran
up
and
down
it
in
all
directions
no
horse
anywhere
The
hurdle-fence
enclosing
Panteley
Eremyitch
's
yard
had
long
been
dilapidated
and
in
many
places
was
bent
and
lying
on
the
ground
Beside
the
stable
it
had
been
completely
levelled
for
a
good
yard
's
width
Perfishka
pointed
this
spot
out
to
Tchertop-hanov
'Master
look
here
this
was
n't
like
this
to-day
And
see
the
ends
of
the
uprights
sticking
out
of
the
ground
that
means
someone
has
pulled
them
out
Tchertop-hanov
ran
up
with
the
lantern
moved
it
about
over
the
ground
'Hoofs
hoofs
prints
of
horse-shoes
fresh
prints
he
muttered
speaking
hurriedly
They
took
him
through
here
through
here
He
instantly
leaped
over
the
fence
and
with
a
shout
'Malek-Adel
Malek-Adel
he
ran
straight
into
the
open
country
Perfishka
remained
standing
bewildered
at
the
fence
The
ring
of
light
from
the
lantern
was
soon
lost
to
his
eyes
swallowed
up
in
the
dense
darkness
of
a
starless
moonless
night
Fainter
and
fainter
came
the
sound
of
the
despairing
cries
of
Tchertop-hanov
It
was
daylight
when
he
came
home
again
He
hardly
looked
like
a
human
being
His
clothes
were
covered
with
mud
his
face
had
a
wild
and
ferocious
expression
his
eyes
looked
dull
and
sullen
In
a
hoarse
whisper
he
drove
Perfishka
away
and
locked
himself
in
his
room
He
could
hardly
stand
with
fatigue
but
he
did
not
lie
on
his
bed
but
sat
down
on
a
chair
by
the
door
and
clutched
at
his
head
'Stolen
stolen
But
in
what
way
had
the
thief
contrived
by
night
when
the
stable
was
locked
to
steal
Malek-Adel
Malek-Adel
who
would
never
let
a
stranger
come
near
him
even
by
day
steal
him
too
without
noise
without
a
sound
And
how
explain
that
not
a
yard-dog
had
barked
It
was
true
there
were
only
two
left
two
young
puppies
and
those
two
probably
burrowing
in
rubbish
from
cold
and
hunger
but
still
'And
what
am
I
to
do
now
without
Malek-Adel
Tchertop-hanov
brooded
'I
've
lost
my
last
pleasure
now
it
's
time
to
die
Buy
another
horse
seeing
the
money
has
come
But
where
find
another
horse
like
that
'Panteley
Eremyitch
Panteley
Eremyitch
he
heard
a
timid
call
at
the
door
Tchertop-hanov
jumped
on
to
his
feet
'Who
is
it
he
shouted
in
a
voice
not
his
own
'It
's
I
your
groom
Perfishka
'What
do
you
want
Is
he
found
has
he
run
home
'No
Panteley
Eremyitch
but
that
Jew
chap
who
sold
him
'Well
'He
's
come
'Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
yelled
Tchertop-hanov
and
he
at
once
flung
open
the
door
'Drag
him
here
drag
him
along
On
seeing
the
sudden
apparition
of
his
'benefactor
's
dishevelled
wild-looking
figure
the
Jew
who
was
standing
behind
Perfishka
's
back
tried
to
give
them
the
slip
but
Tchertop-hanov
in
two
bounds
was
upon
him
and
like
a
tiger
flew
at
his
throat
'Ah
he
's
come
for
the
money
for
the
money
he
cried
as
hoarsely
as
though
he
were
being
strangled
himself
instead
of
strangling
the
Jew
'you
stole
him
by
night
and
are
come
by
day
for
the
money
eh
Eh
Eh
'Mercy
on
us
your
ex-shelency
the
Jew
tried
to
groan
out
'Tell
me
where
's
my
horse
What
have
you
done
with
him
Whom
have
you
sold
him
to
Tell
me
tell
me
tell
me
The
Jew
by
now
could
not
even
groan
his
face
was
rapidly
turning
livid
and
even
the
expression
of
fear
had
vanished
from
it
His
hands
dropped
and
hung
lifeless
his
whole
body
furiously
shaken
by
Tchertop-hanov
waved
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
reed
'I
'll
pay
you
your
money
I
'll
pay
it
you
in
full
to
the
last
farthing
roared
Tchertop-hanov
'but
I
'll
strangle
you
like
any
chicken
if
you
do
n't
tell
me
at
once
'But
you
have
strangled
him
already
master
observed
the
groom
Perfishka
humbly
Then
only
Tchertop-hanov
came
to
his
senses
He
let
go
of
the
Jew
's
neck
the
latter
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
Tchertop-hanov
picked
him
up
sat
him
on
a
bench
poured
a
glass
of
vodka
down
his
throat
and
restored
him
to
consciousness
And
having
restored
him
to
consciousness
he
began
to
talk
to
him
It
turned
out
that
the
Jew
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
Malek-Adel
had
been
stolen
And
indeed
what
motive
could
he
have
to
steal
the
horse
which
he
had
himself
procured
for
his
'revered
Panteley
Eremyitch
Then
Tchertop-hanov
led
him
into
the
stable
Together
they
scrutinised
the
horse-boxes
the
manger
and
the
lock
on
the
door
turned
over
the
hay
and
the
straw
and
then
went
into
the
courtyard
Tchertop-hanov
showed
the
Jew
the
hoofprints
at
the
fence
and
all
at
once
he
slapped
his
thighs
'Stay
he
cried
'Where
did
you
buy
the
horse
'In
the
district
of
Maloarchangel
at
Verhosensky
Fair
answered
the
Jew
'Of
whom
'A
Cossack
Stay
This
Cossack
was
he
a
young
man
or
old
'Middle-aged
a
steady
man
'And
what
was
he
like
What
did
he
look
like
A
cunning
rascal
I
expect
'Sure
to
have
been
a
rascal
your
ex-shelency
'And
I
say
what
did
he
say
this
rascal
had
he
had
the
horse
long
'I
recollect
he
said
he
'd
had
it
a
long
while
'Well
then
no
one
could
have
stolen
him
but
he
Consider
it
yourself
listen
stand
here
What
's
your
name
The
Jew
started
and
turned
his
little
black
eyes
upon
Tchertop-hanov
'What
's
my
name
'Yes
yes
what
are
you
called
'Moshel
Leyba
'Well
judge
then
Moshel
Leyba
my
friend
you
're
a
man
of
sense
whom
would
Malek-Adel
have
allowed
to
touch
him
except
his
old
master
You
see
he
must
have
saddled
him
and
bridled
him
and
taken
off
his
cloth
there
it
is
lying
on
the
hay
and
made
all
his
arrangements
simply
as
if
he
were
at
home
Why
anyone
except
his
master
Malek-Adel
would
have
trampled
under
foot
He
'd
have
raised
such
a
din
he
'd
have
roused
the
whole
village
Do
you
agree
with
me
'I
agree
I
agree
your
ex-shelency
'Well
then
it
follows
that
first
of
all
we
must
find
this
Cossack
'But
how
are
we
to
find
him
your
ex-shelency
I
have
only
seen
him
one
little
time
in
my
life
and
where
is
he
now
and
what
's
his
name
Alack
alack
added
the
Jew
shaking
the
long
curls
over
his
ears
sorrowfully
'Leyba
shouted
Tchertop-hanov
suddenly
'Leyba
look
at
me
You
see
I
've
lost
my
senses
I
'm
not
myself
I
shall
lay
hands
on
myself
if
you
do
n't
come
to
my
aid
'But
how
can
I
'Come
with
me
and
let
us
find
the
thief
'But
where
shall
we
go
'We
'll
go
to
the
fairs
the
highways
and
by-ways
to
the
horse-stealers
to
towns
and
villages
and
hamlets
everywhere
everywhere
And
don't
trouble
about
money
I
've
come
into
a
fortune
brother
I
'll
spend
my
last
farthing
but
I
'll
get
my
darling
back
And
he
sha
n't
escape
us
our
enemy
the
Cossack
Where
he
goes
we
'll
go
If
he
's
hidden
in
the
earth
we
'll
follow
him
If
he
's
gone
to
the
devil
we
'll
follow
him
to
Satan
himself
'Oh
why
to
Satan
observed
the
Jew
'we
can
do
without
him
'Leyba
Tchertop-hanov
went
on
'Leyba
though
you
're
a
Jew
and
your
creed
's
an
accursed
one
you
've
a
soul
better
than
many
a
Christian
soul
Have
pity
on
me
I
ca
n't
go
alone
alone
I
can
never
carry
the
thing
through
I
'm
a
hot-headed
fellow
but
you
've
a
brain
a
brain
worth
its
weight
in
gold
Your
race
are
like
that
you
succeed
in
everything
without
being
taught
You
're
wondering
perhaps
where
I
could
have
got
the
money
Come
into
my
room
I
'll
show
you
all
the
money
You
may
take
it
you
may
take
the
cross
off
my
neck
only
give
me
back
Malek-Adel
give
him
me
back
again
Tchertop-hanov
was
shivering
as
if
he
were
in
a
fever
the
sweat
rolled
down
his
face
in
drops
and
mingling
with
his
tears
was
lost
in
his
moustaches
He
pressed
Leyba
's
hands
he
besought
him
he
almost
kissed
him
He
was
in
a
sort
of
delirium
The
Jew
tried
to
object
to
declare
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
him
to
get
away
that
he
had
business
It
was
useless
Tchertop-hanov
would
not
even
hear
anything
There
was
no
help
for
it
the
poor
Jew
consented
The
next
day
Tchertop-hanov
set
out
from
Bezsonovo
in
a
peasant
cart
with
Leyba
The
Jew
wore
a
somewhat
troubled
aspect
he
held
on
to
the
rail
with
one
hand
while
all
his
withered
figure
bounded
up
and
down
on
the
jolting
seat
the
other
hand
he
held
pressed
to
his
bosom
where
lay
a
packet
of
notes
wrapped
up
in
newspaper
Tchertop-hanov
sat
like
a
statue
only
moving
his
eyes
about
him
and
drawing
in
deep
breaths
in
his
sash
there
was
stuck
a
dagger
'There
the
miscreant
who
has
parted
us
must
look
out
for
himself
now
he
muttered
as
they
drove
out
on
the
high-road
His
house
he
left
in
the
charge
of
Perfishka
and
an
old
cook
a
deaf
old
peasant
woman
whom
he
took
care
of
out
of
compassion
'I
shall
come
back
to
you
on
Malek-Adel
he
shouted
to
them
at
parting
'or
never
come
back
at
all
'You
might
as
well
be
married
to
me
at
once
jested
Perfishka
giving
the
cook
a
dig
in
the
ribs
with
his
elbow
'No
fear
the
master
'll
never
come
back
to
us
and
here
I
shall
be
bored
to
death
all
alone
A
year
passed
a
whole
year
no
news
had
come
of
Panteley
Eremyitch
The
cook
was
dead
Perfishka
himself
made
up
his
mind
to
abandon
the
house
and
go
off
to
town
where
he
was
constantly
being
persuaded
to
come
by
his
cousin
apprenticed
to
a
barber
when
suddenly
a
rumour
was
set
afloat
that
his
master
was
coming
back
The
parish
deacon
got
a
letter
from
Panteley
Eremyitch
himself
in
which
he
informed
him
of
his
intention
of
arriving
at
Bezsonovo
and
asked
him
to
prepare
his
servant
to
be
ready
for
his
immediate
return
These
words
Perfishka
understood
to
mean
that
he
was
to
sweep
up
the
place
a
bit
He
did
not
however
put
much
confidence
in
the
news
he
was
convinced
though
that
the
deacon
had
spoken
the
truth
when
a
few
days
later
Panteley
Eremyitch
in
person
appeared
in
the
courtyard
riding
on
Malek-Adel
Perfishka
rushed
up
to
his
master
and
holding
the
stirrup
would
have
helped
him
to
dismount
but
the
latter
got
off
alone
and
with
a
triumphant
glance
about
him
cried
in
a
loud
voice
'I
said
I
would
find
Malek-Adel
and
I
have
found
him
in
spite
of
my
enemies
and
of
Fate
itself
Perfishka
went
up
to
kiss
his
hand
but
Tchertop-hanov
paid
no
attention
to
his
servant
's
devotion
Leading
Malek-Adel
after
him
by
the
rein
he
went
with
long
strides
towards
the
stable
Perfishka
looked
more
intently
at
his
master
and
his
heart
sank
'Oh
how
thin
and
old
he
's
grown
in
a
year
and
what
a
stern
grim
face
One
would
have
thought
Panteley
Eremyitch
would
have
been
rejoicing
that
he
had
gained
his
end
and
he
was
rejoicing
certainly
and
yet
Perfishka
's
heart
sank
he
even
felt
a
sort
of
dread
Tchertop-hanov
put
the
horse
in
its
old
place
gave
him
a
light
pat
on
the
back
and
said
'There
now
you
're
at
home
again
and
mind
what
you
're
about
The
same
day
he
hired
a
freedman
out
of
work
as
watchman
established
himself
again
in
his
rooms
and
began
living
as
before
Not
altogether
as
before
however
but
of
that
later
The
day
after
his
return
Panteley
Eremyitch
called
Perfishka
in
to
him
and
for
want
of
anyone
else
to
talk
to
began
telling
him
keeping
up
of
course
his
sense
of
his
own
dignity
and
his
bass
voice
how
he
had
succeeded
in
finding
Malek-Adel
Tchertop-hanov
sat
facing
the
window
while
he
told
his
story
and
smoked
a
pipe
with
a
long
tube
while
Perfishka
stood
in
the
doorway
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
respectfully
contemplating
the
back
of
