fancy
I
have
a
dim
perception
of
them
I
questioned
the
mediator
about
Evlampia
Martinovna
and
learnt
that
she
had
been
lost
sight
of
completely
ever
since
she
left
home
and
probably
had
departed
this
life
long
ago
So
our
worthy
mediator
expressed
himself
but
I
am
convinced
that
I
have
seen
Evlampia
that
I
have
come
across
her
This
was
how
it
was
Four
years
after
my
interview
with
Anna
Martinovna
I
was
spending
the
summer
at
Murino
a
little
hamlet
near
Petersburg
a
well-known
resort
of
summer
visitors
of
the
middle
class
The
shooting
was
pretty
decent
about
Murino
at
that
time
and
I
used
to
go
out
with
my
gun
almost
every
day
I
had
a
companion
on
my
expeditions
a
man
of
the
tradesman
class
called
Vikulov
a
very
sensible
and
good-natured
fellow
but
as
he
said
of
himself
of
no
position
whatever
This
man
had
been
simply
everywhere
and
everything
Nothing
could
astonish
him
he
knew
everything
but
he
cared
for
nothing
but
shooting
and
wine
Well
one
day
we
were
on
our
way
home
to
Murino
and
we
chanced
to
pass
a
solitary
house
standing
at
the
cross-roads
and
enclosed
by
a
high
close
paling
It
was
not
the
first
time
I
had
seen
the
house
and
every
time
it
excited
my
curiosity
There
was
something
about
it
mysterious
locked-up
grimly-dumb
something
suggestive
of
a
prison
or
a
hospital
Nothing
of
it
could
be
seen
from
the
road
but
its
steep
dark
red-painted
roof
There
was
only
one
pair
of
gates
in
the
whole
fence
and
these
seemed
fastened
and
never
opened
No
sound
came
from
the
other
side
of
them
For
all
that
we
felt
that
some
one
was
certainly
living
in
the
house
it
had
not
at
all
the
air
of
a
deserted
dwelling
On
the
contrary
everything
about
it
was
stout
and
tight
and
strong
as
if
it
would
stand
a
siege
What
is
that
fortress
I
asked
my
companion
Don
t
you
know
Vikulov
gave
a
sly
wink
A
fine
building
eh
The
police-captain
of
these
parts
gets
a
nice
little
income
out
of
it
How
s
that
I
ll
tell
you
You
ve
heard
I
daresay
of
the
Flagellant
dissenters
that
do
without
priests
you
know
Yes
Well
it
s
there
that
their
chief
mother
lives
A
woman
Yes
the
mother
a
mother
of
God
they
say
Nonsense
I
tell
you
it
is
so
She
is
a
strict
one
they
say
A
regular
commander-in-chief
She
rules
over
thousands
I
d
take
her
and
all
these
mothers
of
God
But
what
s
the
use
of
talking
He
called
his
Pegashka
a
marvellous
dog
with
an
excellent
scent
but
with
no
notion
of
setting
Vikulov
was
obliged
to
tie
her
hind
paws
to
keep
her
from
running
so
furiously
His
words
sank
into
my
memory
I
sometimes
went
out
of
my
way
to
pass
by
the
mysterious
house
One
day
I
had
just
got
up
to
it
when
suddenly
wonderful
to
relate
a
bolt
grated
in
the
gates
a
key
creaked
in
the
lock
then
the
gates
themselves
slowly
parted
there
appeared
a
large
horse
s
head
with
a
plaited
forelock
under
a
decorated
yoke
and
slowly
there
rolled
into
the
road
a
small
cart
like
those
driven
by
horse-dealers
and
higglers
On
the
leather
cushion
of
the
cart
near
to
me
sat
a
peasant
of
about
thirty
of
a
remarkably
handsome
and
attractive
appearance
in
a
neat
black
smock
and
a
black
cap
pulled
down
low
on
his
forehead
He
was
carefully
driving
the
well-fed
horse
whose
sides
were
as
broad
as
a
stove
Beside
the
peasant
on
the
far
side
of
the
cart
sat
a
tall
woman
as
straight
as
an
arrow
Her
head
was
covered
by
a
costly-looking
black
shawl
She
was
dressed
in
a
short
jerkin
of
dove-coloured
velvet
and
a
dark
blue
merino
skirt
her
white
hands
she
held
discreetly
clasped
on
her
bosom
The
cart
turned
on
the
road
to
the
left
and
brought
the
woman
within
two
paces
of
me
she
turned
her
head
a
little
and
I
recognised
Evlampia
Harlov
I
knew
her
at
once
I
did
not
doubt
for
one
instant
and
indeed
no
doubt
was
possible
eyes
like
hers
and
above
all
that
cut
of
the
lips
haughty
and
sensual
I
had
never
seen
in
any
one
else
Her
face
had
grown
longer
and
thinner
the
skin
was
darker
here
and
there
lines
could
be
discerned
but
above
all
the
expression
of
the
face
was
changed
It
is
difficult
to
do
justice
in
words
to
the
self-confidence
the
sternness
the
pride
it
had
gained
Not
simply
the
serenity
of
power
the
satiety
of
power
was
visible
in
every
feature
The
careless
glance
she
cast
at
me
told
of
long
years
of
habitually
meeting
nothing
but
reverent
unquestioning
obedience
That
woman
clearly
lived
surrounded
not
by
worshippers
but
by
slaves
She
had
clearly
forgotten
even
the
time
when
any
command
any
desire
of
hers
was
not
carried
out
at
the
instant
I
called
her
loudly
by
her
name
and
her
father
s
she
gave
a
faint
start
looked
at
me
a
second
time
not
with
alarm
but
with
contemptuous
wrath
as
though
asking
Who
dares
to
disturb
me
and
barely
parting
her
lips
uttered
a
word
of
command
The
peasant
sitting
beside
her
started
forward
with
a
wave
of
his
arm
struck
the
horse
with
the
reins
the
horse
set
off
at
a
strong
rapid
trot
and
the
cart
disappeared
Since
then
I
have
not
seen
Evlampia
again
In
what
way
Martin
Petrovitch
s
daughter
came
to
be
a
Holy
Virgin
in
the
Flagellant
sect
I
can
not
imagine
But
who
knows
very
likely
she
has
founded
a
sect
which
will
be
called
or
even
now
is
called
after
her
name
the
Evlampieshtchin
sect
Anything
may
be
anything
may
come
to
pass
And
so
this
is
what
I
had
to
tell
you
of
my
Lear
of
the
Steppes
of
his
family
and
his
doings
The
story-teller
ceased
and
we
talked
a
little
longer
and
then
parted
each
to
his
home

FIRST

FROM
PAVEL
ALEXANDROVITCH

TO

NIKOLAEVITCH
V
M
VILLAGE
6th
June
1850
I
have
been
here
for
three
days
my
dear
fellow
and
as
I
promised
I
take
up
my
pen
to
write
to
you
It
has
been
drizzling
with
fine
rain
ever
since
the
morning
I
can
t
go
out
and
I
want
a
little
chat
with
you
too
Here
I
am
again
in
my
old
home
where
it
s
a
dreadful
thing
to
say
I
have
not
been
for
nine
long
years
Really
as
you
may
fancy
I
have
become
quite
a
different
man
Yes
utterly
different
indeed
do
you
remember
in
the
drawing-room
the
little
tarnished
looking-glass
of
my
great-grandmother
s
with
the
queer
little
curly
scrolls
in
the
corners
you
always
used
to
be
speculating
on
what
it
had
seen
a
hundred
years
ago
directly
I
arrived
I
went
up
to
it
and
I
could
not
help
feeling
disconcerted
I
suddenly
saw
how
old
and
changed
I
had
become
in
these
last
years
But
I
am
not
alone
in
that
respect
My
little
house
which
was
old
and
tottering
long
ago
will
hardly
hold
together
now
it
is
all
on
the
slant
and
seems
sunk
into
the
ground
My
dear
Vassilievna
the
housekeeper
you
can
t
have
forgotten
her
she
used
to
regale
you
with
such
capital
jam
is
quite
shrivelled
up
and
bent
when
she
saw
me
she
could
not
call
out
and
did
not
start
crying
but
only
moaned
and
choked
sank
helplessly
into
a
chair
and
waved
her
hand
Old
Terenty
has
some
spirit
left
in
him
still
he
holds
himself
up
as
much
as
ever
and
turns
out
his
feet
as
he
walks
He
still
wears
the
same
yellow
nankeen
breeches
and
the
same
creaking
goatskin
slippers
with
high
heels
and
ribbons
which
touched
you
so
much
sometimes
but
mercy
on
us
how
the
breeches
flap
about
his
thin
legs
nowadays
how
white
his
hair
has
grown
and
his
face
has
shrunk
up
into
a
sort
of
little
fist
When
he
speaks
to
me
when
he
begins
directing
the
servants
and
giving
orders
in
the
next
room
it
makes
me
laugh
and
feel
sorry
for
him
All
his
teeth
are
gone
and
he
mumbles
with
a
whistling
hissing
sound
On
the
other
hand
the
garden
has
got
on
wonderfully
The
modest
little
plants
of
lilac
acacia
and
honeysuckle
do
you
remember
we
planted
them
together
have
grown
into
splendid
thick
bushes
The
birches
the
maples
all
that
has
spread
out
and
grown
tall
the
avenues
of
lime-trees
are
particularly
fine
I
love
those
avenues
I
love
the
tender
grey
green
colour
and
the
delicate
fragrance
of
the
air
under
their
arching
boughs
I
love
the
changing
net-work
of
rings
of
light
on
the
dark
earth
there
is
no
sand
here
you
know
My
favourite
oak
sapling
has
grown
into
a
young
oak
tree
Yesterday
I
spent
more
than
an
hour
in
the
middle
of
the
day
on
a
garden
bench
in
its
shade
I
felt
very
happy
All
about
me
the
grass
was
deliciously
luxuriant
a
rich
soft
golden
light
lay
upon
everything
it
made
its
way
even
into
the
shade
and
the
birds
one
could
hear
You
ve
not
forgotten
I
expect
that
birds
are
a
passion
of
mine
The
turtle-doves
cooed
unceasingly
from
time
to
time
there
came
the
whistle
of
the
oriole
the
chaffinch
uttered
its
sweet
little
refrain
the
blackbirds
quarrelled
and
twittered
the
cuckoo
called
far
away
suddenly
like
a
mad
thing
the
woodpecker
uttered
its
shrill
cry
I
listened
and
listened
to
this
subdued
mingled
sound
and
did
not
want
to
move
while
my
heart
was
full
of
something
between
languor
and
tenderness
And
it
s
not
only
the
garden
that
has
grown
up
I
am
continually
coming
across
sturdy
thick-set
lads
whom
I
can
not
recognise
as
the
little
boys
I
used
to
know
in
old
days
Your
favourite
Timosha
has
turned
into
a
Timofay
such
as
you
could
never
imagine
You
had
fears
in
those
days
for
his
health
and
predicted
consumption
but
now
you
should
just
see
his
huge
red
hands
as
they
stick
out
from
the
narrow
sleeves
of
his
nankeen
coat
and
the
stout
rounded
muscles
that
stand
out
all
over
him
He
has
a
neck
like
a
bull
s
and
a
head
all
over
tight
fair
curls
a
regular
Farnese
Hercules
His
face
though
has
changed
less
than
the
others
it
is
not
even
much
larger
in
circumference
and
the
good-humoured
gaping
as
you
used
to
say
smile
has
remained
the
same
I
have
taken
him
to
be
my
valet
I
got
rid
of
my
Petersburg
fellow
at
Moscow
he
was
really
too
fond
of
putting
me
to
shame
and
making
me
feel
the
superiority
of
his
Petersburg
manners
Of
my
dogs
I
have
not
found
one
they
have
all
passed
away
Nefka
lived
longer
than
any
of
them
and
she
did
not
live
till
my
return
as
Argos
lived
till
the
return
of
Ulysses
she
was
not
fated
to
look
once
more
with
her
lustreless
eyes
on
her
master
and
companion
in
the
chase
But
Shavka
is
all
right
and
barks
as
hoarsely
as
ever
and
has
one
ear
torn
just
the
same
and
burrs
sticking
to
his
tail
all
just
as
it
should
be
I
have
taken
up
my
abode
in
what
was
your
room
It
is
true
the
sun
beats
down
upon
it
and
there
are
a
lot
of
flies
in
it
but
there
is
less
of
the
smell
of
the
old
house
in
it
than
in
the
other
rooms
It
s
a
queer
thing
that
musty
rather
sour
faint
smell
has
a
powerful
effect
on
my
imagination
I
don
t
mean
that
it
s
disagreeable
to
me
quite
the
contrary
but
it
produces
melancholy
and
at
last
depression
I
am
very
fond
just
as
you
are
of
podgy
old
chests
with
brass
plates
white
armchairs
with
oval
backs
and
crooked
legs
fly-blown
glass
lustres
with
a
big
egg
of
lilac
tinsel
in
the
centre
of
all
sorts
of
ancestral
furniture
in
fact
But
I
can
t
stand
seeing
it
all
continually
a
sort
of
agitated
dejection
it
is
just
that
takes
possession
of
me
In
the
room
where
I
have
established
myself
the
furniture
is
of
the
most
ordinary
home-made
description
I
have
left
though
in
the
corner
a
long
narrow
set
of
shelves
on
which
there
is
an
old-fashioned
set
of
blown
green
and
blue
glasses
just
discernible
through
the
dust
And
I
have
had
hung
on
the
wall
that
portrait
of
a
woman
you
remember
in
the
black
frame
that
you
used
to
call
the
portrait
of
Manon
Lescaut
It
has
got
rather
darker
in
these
nine
years
but
the
eyes
have
the
same
pensive
sly
and
tender
look
the
lips
have
the
same
capricious
melancholy
smile
and
the
half-plucked
rose
falls
as
softly
as
ever
from
her
slender
fingers
I
am
greatly
amused
by
the
blinds
in
my
room
They
were
once
green
but
have
been
turned
yellow
by
the
sun
on
them
are
depicted
in
dark
colours
scenes
from
d
Arlencourt
s
Hermit
On
one
curtain
the
hermit
with
an
immense
beard
goggle-eyes
and
sandals
on
his
feet
is
carrying
off
a
young
lady
with
dishevelled
locks
to
the
mountains
On
another
one
there
is
a
terrific
combat
going
on
between
four
knights
wearing
birettas
and
with
puffs
on
their
shoulders
one
much
foreshortened
lies
slain
in
fact
there
are
pictures
of
all
sorts
of
horrors
while
all
about
there
is
such
unbroken
peace
and
the
blinds
themselves
throw
such
soft
light
on
the
ceiling
A
sort
of
inward
calm
has
come
upon
me
since
I
have
been
settled
here
one
wants
to
do
nothing
one
wants
to
see
no
one
one
looks
forward
to
nothing
one
is
too
lazy
for
thought
but
not
too
lazy
for
musing
two
different
things
as
you
know
well
Memories
of
childhood
at
first
came
flooding
upon
me
wherever
I
went
whatever
I
looked
at
they
surged
up
on
all
sides
distinct
to
the
smallest
detail
and
as
it
were
immovable
in
their
clearly
defined
outlines
Then
these
memories
were
succeeded
by
others
then
then
I
gradually
turned
away
from
the
past
and
all
that
was
left
was
a
sort
of
drowsy
heaviness
in
my
heart
Fancy
as
I
was
sitting
on
the
dike
under
a
willow
I
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
burst
out
crying
and
should
have
gone
on
crying
a
long
while
in
spite
of
my
advanced
years
if
I
had
not
been
put
to
shame
by
a
passing
peasant
woman
who
stared
at
me
with
curiosity
then
without
turning
her
face
towards
me
gave
a
low
bow
from
the
waist
and
passed
on
I
should
be
very
glad
to
remain
in
the
same
mood
I
shan
t
do
any
more
crying
of
course
till
I
go
away
from
here
that
is
till
September
and
should
be
very
sorry
if
any
of
my
neighbours
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
call
on
me
However
there
is
no
danger
I
fancy
of
that
I
have
no
near
neighbours
here
You
will
understand
me
I
m
sure
you
know
yourself
by
experience
how
often
solitude
is
beneficial
I
need
it
now
after
wanderings
of
all
sorts
But
I
shan
t
be
dull
I
have
brought
a
few
books
with
me
and
I
have
a
pretty
fair
library
here
Yesterday
I
opened
all
the
bookcases
and
was
a
long
while
rummaging
about
among
the
musty
books
I
found
many
curious
things
I
had
not
noticed
before
Candide
in
a
manuscript
translation
of
somewhere
about
1770
newspapers
and
magazines
of
the
same
period
the
Triumphant
Chameleon
that
is
Mirabeau
le
Paysan
Perverti
etc
I
came
across
children
s
books
my
own
and
my
father
s
and
my
grandmother
s
and
even
fancy
my
great
grandmother
s
in
one
dilapidated
French
grammar
in
a
particoloured
binding
was
written
in
fat
letters
Ce
livre
appartient
Mlle
Eudoxie
de
Lavrine
and
it
was
dated
1741
I
saw
books
I
had
brought
at
different
times
from
abroad
among
others
Goethe
s
Faust
You
re
not
aware
perhaps
that
there
was
a
time
when
I
knew
Faust
by
heart
the
first
part
of
course
word
for
word
I
was
never
tired
of
reading
it
But
other
days
other
dreams
and
for
the
last
nine
years
it
has
so
happened
that
I
have
scarcely
had
a
Goethe
in
my
hand
It
was
with
an
indescribable
emotion
that
I
saw
the
little
book
I
knew
so
well
again
a
poor
edition
of
1828
I
brought
it
away
with
me
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
began
to
read
How
all
that
splendid
first
scene
affected
me
The
entrance
of
the
Spirit
of
the
Earth
the
words
you
remember
on
the
tide
of
life
in
the
whirl
of
creation
stirred
a
long
unfamiliar
tremor
and
shiver
of
ecstasy
I
recalled
everything
Berlin
and
student
days
and
Fr
ulein
Clara
Stick
and
Zeidelmann
in
the
r
le
of
Mephistopheles
and
the
music
of
Radzivil
and
all
and
everything
It
was
a
long
while
before
I
could
get
to
sleep
my
youth
rose
up
and
stood
before
me
like
a
phantom
it
ran
like
fire
like
poison
through
my
veins
my
heart
leaped
and
would
not
be
still
something
plucked
at
its
chords
and
yearnings
began
surging
up
You
see
what
fantasies
your
friend
gives
himself
up
to
at
almost
forty
when
he
sits
in
solitude
in
his
solitary
little
house
What
if
any
one
could
have
peeped
at
me
Well
what
I
shouldn
t
have
been
a
bit
ashamed
of
myself
To
be
ashamed
is
a
sign
of
youth
too
and
I
have
begun
do
you
know
how
to
notice
that
I
m
getting
old
I
ll
tell
you
how
I
try
in
these
days
to
make
as
much
as
I
can
of
my
happy
sensations
and
to
make
little
of
my
sad
ones
and
in
the
days
of
my
youth
I
did
just
the
opposite
At
times
one
used
to
carry
about
one
s
melancholy
as
if
it
were
a
treasure
and
be
ashamed
of
a
cheerful
mood
But
for
all
that
it
strikes
me
that
in
spite
of
all
my
experience
of
life
there
is
something
in
the
world
friend
Horatio
which
I
have
not
experienced
and
that
something
almost
the
most
important
Oh
what
have
I
worked
myself
up
to
Farewell
for
the
present
What
are
you
about
in
Petersburg
By
the
way
Savely
my
country
cook
wishes
to
send
his
duty
to
you
He
too
is
older
but
not
very
much
so
he
is
grown
rather
corpulent
stouter
all
over
He
is
as
good
as
ever
at
chicken-soup
with
stewed
onions
cheesecakes
with
goffered
edges
and
peagoose
peagoose
is
the
famous
dish
of
the
steppes
which
makes
your
tongue
white
and
rough
for
twenty-four
hours
after
On
the
other
hand
he
roasts
the
meat
as
he
always
did
so
that
you
can
hammer
on
the
plate
with
it
hard
as
a
board
But
I
must
really
say
good-bye

SECOND
LETTER
From
the
SAME
to
the
SAME
M
VILLAGE
June
12
1850
I
have
rather
an
important
piece
of
news
to
tell
you
my
dear
friend
Listen
Yesterday
I
felt
disposed
for
a
walk
before
dinner
only
not
in
the
garden
I
walked
along
the
road
towards
the
town
Walking
rapidly
quite
aimlessly
along
a
straight
long
road
is
very
pleasant
You
feel
as
if
you
re
doing
something
hurrying
somewhere
I
look
up
a
coach
is
coming
towards
me
Surely
not
some
one
to
see
me
I
wondered
with
secret
terror
No
there
was
a
gentleman
with
moustaches
in
the
carriage
a
stranger
to
me
I
felt
reassured
But
all
of
a
sudden
when
he
got
abreast
with
me
this
gentleman
told
the
coachman
to
stop
the
horses
politely
raised
his
cap
and
still
more
politely
asked
me
was
not
I
mentioning
my
name
I
too
came
to
a
standstill
and
with
the
fortitude
of
a
prisoner
brought
up
for
trial
replied
that
I
was
myself
while
I
stared
like
a
sheep
at
the
gentleman
with
the
moustaches
and
said
to
myself
I
do
believe
I
ve
seen
him
somewhere
You
don
t
recognise
me
he
observed
as
he
got
out
of
the
coach
No
I
don
t
But
I
knew
you
directly
Explanations
followed
it
appeared
that
it
was
Priemkov
do
you
remember
a
fellow
we
used
to
know
at
the
university
Why
is
that
an
important
piece
of
news
you
are
asking
yourself
at
this
instant
my
dear
Semyon
Nikolaitch
Priemkov
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
was
rather
a
dull
chap
no
harm
in
him
though
and
not
a
fool
Just
so
my
dear
boy
but
hear
the
rest
of
our
conversation
I
was
delighted
says
he
when
I
heard
you
had
come
to
your
country-place
into
our
neighbourhood
But
I
was
not
alone
in
that
feeling
Allow
me
to
ask
I
questioned
who
was
so
kind
My
wife
Your
wife
Yes
my
wife
she
is
an
old
acquaintance
of
yours
May
I
ask
what
was
your
wife
s
name
Vera
Nikolaevna
she
was
an
Eltsov
Vera
Nikolaevna
I
could
not
help
exclaiming
This
it
is
which
is
the
important
piece
of
news
I
spoke
of
at
the
beginning
of
my
letter
But
perhaps
you
don
t
see
anything
important
even
in
this
I
shall
have
to
tell
you
something
of
my
past
long
past
life
When
we
both
left
the
university
in
183
I
was
three-and-twenty
You
went
into
the
service
I
decided
as
you
know
to
go
to
Berlin
But
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
in
Berlin
before
October
I
wanted
to
spend
the
summer
in
Russia
in
the
country
to
have
a
good
lazy
holiday
for
the
last
time
and
then
to
set
to
work
in
earnest
How
far
this
last
project
was
carried
out
there
is
no
need
to
enlarge
upon
here
But
where
am
I
to
spend
the
summer
I
asked
myself
I
did
not
want
to
go
to
my
own
place
my
father
had
died
not
long
before
I
had
no
near
relations
I
was
afraid
of
the
solitude
and
dreariness
And
so
I
was
delighted
to
receive
an
invitation
from
a
distant
cousin
to
stay
at
his
country-place
in
T
province
He
was
a
well-to-do
good-natured
simple-hearted
man
he
lived
in
style
as
a
country
magnate
and
had
a
palatial
country
house
I
went
to
stay
there
My
cousin
had
a
large
family
two
sons
and
five
daughters
Besides
them
there
was
always
a
crowd
of
people
in
his
house
Guests
were
for
ever
arriving
and
yet
it
wasn
t
jolly
at
all
The
days
were
spent
in
noisy
entertainments
there
was
no
chance
of
being
by
oneself
Everything
was
done
in
common
every
one
tried
to
be
entertaining
to
invent
some
amusement
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
every
one
was
fearfully
exhausted
There
was
something
vulgar
about
the
way
we
lived
I
was
already
beginning
to
look
forward
to
getting
away
and
was
only
waiting
till
my
cousin
s
birthday
festivities
were
over
when
on
the
very
day
of
those
festivities
at
the
ball
I
saw
Vera
Nikolaevna
Eltsov
and
I
stayed
on
She
was
at
that
time
sixteen
She
was
living
with
her
mother
on
a
little
estate
four
miles
from
my
cousin
s
place
Her
father
a
remarkable
man
I
have
been
told
had
risen
rapidly
to
the
grade
of
colonel
and
would
have
attained
further
distinctions
but
he
died
young
accidentally
shot
by
a
friend
when
out
shooting
Vera
Nikolaevna
was
a
baby
at
the
time
of
his
death
Her
mother
too
was
an
exceptional
woman
she
spoke
several
languages
and
was
very
well
informed
She
was
seven
or
eight
years
older
than
her
husband
whom
she
had
married
for
love
he
had
run
away
with
her
in
secret
from
her
father
s
house
She
never
got
over
his
loss
and
till
the
day
of
her
death
I
heard
from
Priemkov
that
she
had
died
soon
after
her
daughter
s
marriage
she
never
wore
anything
but
black
I
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
her
face
it
was
expressive
dark
with
thick
hair
beginning
to
turn
grey
large
severe
lustreless
eyes
and
a
straight
fine
nose
Her
father
his
surname
was
Ladanov
had
lived
for
fifteen
years
in
Italy
Vera
Nikolaevna
s
mother
was
the
daughter
of
a
simple
Albanian
peasant
girl
who
the
day
after
giving
birth
to
her
child
was
killed
by
her
betrothed
lover
a
Transteverino
peasant
from
whom
Ladanov
had
enticed
her
away
The
story
made
a
great
sensation
at
the
time
On
his
return
to
Russia
Ladanov
never
left
his
house
nor
even
his
study
he
devoted
himself
to
chemistry
anatomy
and
magical
arts
tried
to
discover
means
to
prolong
human
life
fancied
he
could
hold
intercourse
with
spirits
and
call
up
the
dead
The
neighbours
looked
upon
him
as
a
sorcerer
He
was
extremely
fond
of
his
daughter
and
taught
her
everything
himself
but
he
never
forgave
her
elopement
with
Eltsov
never
allowed
either
of
them
to
come
into
his
presence
predicted
a
life
of
sorrow
for
both
of
them
and
died
in
solitude
When
Madame
Eltsov
was
left
a
widow
she
devoted
her
whole
time
to
the
education
of
her
daughter
and
scarcely
saw
any
friends
When
I
first
met
Vera
Nikolaevna
she
had
just
fancy
never
been
in
a
town
in
her
life
not
even
in
the
town
of
her
district
Vera
Nikolaevna
was
not
like
the
common
run
of
Russian
girls
there
was
the
stamp
of
something
special
upon
her
I
was
struck
from
the
first
minute
by
the
extraordinary
repose
of
all
her
movements
and
remarks
She
seemed
free
from
any
sort
of
disturbance
or
agitation
she
answered
simply
and
intelligently
and
listened
attentively
The
expression
of
her
face
was
sincere
and
truthful
as
a
child
s
but
a
little
cold
and
immobile
though
not
dreamy
She
was
rarely
gay
and
not
in
the
way
other
girls
are
the
serenity
of
an
innocent
heart
shone
out
in
everything
about
her
and
cheered
one
more
than
any
gaiety
She
was
not
tall
and
had
a
very
good
figure
rather
slender
she
had
soft
regular
features
a
lovely
smooth
brow
light
golden
hair
a
straight
nose
like
her
mother
s
and
rather
full
lips
her
dark
grey
eyes
looked
out
somewhat
too
directly
from
under
soft
upward-turned
eyelashes
Her
hands
were
small
and
not
very
pretty
one
never
sees
hands
like
hers
on
people
of
talent
and
as
a
fact
Vera
Nikolaevna
had
no
special
talents
Her
voice
rang
out
clear
as
a
child
of
seven
s
I
was
presented
to
her
mother
at
my
cousin
s
ball
and
a
few
days
later
I
called
on
them
for
the
first
time
Madame
Eltsov
was
a
very
strange
woman
a
woman
of
character
of
strong
will
and
concentration
She
had
a
great
influence
on
me
I
at
once
respected
her
and
feared
her
Everything
with
her
was
done
on
a
principle
and
she
had
educated
her
daughter
too
on
a
principle
though
she
did
not
interfere
with
her
freedom
Her
daughter
loved
her
and
trusted
her
blindly
Madame
Eltsov
had
only
to
give
her
a
book
and
say
Don
t
read
that
page
she
would
prefer
to
skip
the
preceding
page
as
well
and
would
certainly
never
glance
at
the
page
interdicted
But
Madame
Eltsov
too
had
her
id
es
fixes
her
fads
She
was
mortally
afraid
for
instance
of
anything
that
might
work
upon
the
imagination
And
so
her
daughter
reached
the
age
of
seventeen
without
ever
having
read
a
novel
or
a
poem
while
in
Geography
History
and
even
Natural
History
she
would
often
put
me
to
shame
graduate
as
I
was
and
a
graduate
as
you
know
not
by
any
means
low
down
on
the
list
either
I
used
to
try
and
argue
with
Madame
Eltsov
about
her
fad
though
it
was
difficult
to
draw
her
into
conversation
she
was
very
silent
She
simply
shook
her
head
You
tell
me
she
said
at
last
that
reading
poetry
is
both
useful
and
pleasant
I
consider
one
must
make
one
s
choice
early
in
life
either
the
useful
or
the
pleasant
and
abide
by
it
once
for
all
I
too
tried
at
one
time
to
unite
the
two
That
s
impossible
and
leads
to
ruin
or
vulgarity
Yes
a
wonderful
being
she
was
that
woman
an
upright
proud
nature
not
without
a
certain
fanaticism
and
superstition
of
her
own
I
am
afraid
of
life
she
said
to
me
one
day
And
really
she
was
afraid
of
it
afraid
of
those
secret
forces
on
which
life
rests
and
which
rarely
but
so
suddenly
break
out
Woe
to
him
who
is
their
sport
These
forces
had
shown
themselves
in
fearful
shape
for
Madame
Eltsov
think
of
her
mother
s
death
her
husband
s
her
father
s
Any
one
would
have
been
panic-stricken
I
never
saw
her
smile
She
had
as
it
were
locked
herself
up
and
thrown
the
key
into
the
water
She
must
have
suffered
great
grief
in
her
time
and
had
never
shared
it
with
any
one
she
had
hidden
it
all
away
within
herself
She
had
so
thoroughly
trained
herself
not
to
give
way
to
her
feelings
that
she
was
even
ashamed
to
express
her
passionate
love
for
her
daughter
she
never
once
kissed
her
in
my
presence
and
never
used
any
endearing
names
always
Vera
I
remember
one
saying
of
hers
I
happened
to
say
to
her
that
all
of
us
modern
people
were
half
broken
by
life
It
s
no
good
being
half
