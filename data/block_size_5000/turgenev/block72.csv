in
his
whole
personality
the
lines
of
his
mouth
grew
harder
and
less
flexible
and
a
dull
persistent
fire
glowed
in
the
depths
of
his
eyes
Insarov
did
not
care
to
enlarge
on
his
own
travels
in
his
country
but
of
Bulgaria
in
general
he
talked
readily
with
any
one
He
talked
at
length
of
the
Turks
of
their
oppression
of
the
sorrows
and
disasters
of
his
countrymen
and
of
their
hopes
concentrated
meditation
on
a
single
ruling
passion
could
be
heard
in
every
word
he
uttered
Ah
well
there
s
no
mistake
about
it
Bersenyev
was
reflecting
meanwhile
that
Turkish
aga
I
venture
to
think
has
been
punished
for
his
father
s
and
mother
s
death
Insarov
had
not
had
time
to
say
all
he
wanted
to
say
when
the
door
opened
and
Shubin
made
his
appearance
He
came
into
the
room
with
an
almost
exaggerated
air
of
ease
and
good-humour
Bersenyev
who
knew
him
well
could
see
at
once
that
something
had
been
jarring
on
him
I
will
introduce
myself
without
ceremony
he
began
with
a
bright
and
open
expression
on
his
face
My
name
is
Shubin
I
m
a
friend
of
this
young
man
here
he
indicated
Bersenyev
You
are
Mr
Insarov
of
course
aren
t
you
I
am
Insarov
Then
give
me
your
hand
and
let
us
be
friends
I
don
t
know
if
Bersenyev
has
talked
to
you
about
me
but
he
has
told
me
a
great
deal
about
you
You
are
staying
here
Capital
Don
t
be
offended
at
my
staring
at
you
so
I
m
a
sculptor
by
trade
and
I
foresee
I
shall
in
a
little
time
be
begging
your
permission
to
model
your
head
My
head
s
at
your
service
said
Insarov
What
shall
we
do
to-day
eh
began
Shubin
sitting
down
suddenly
on
a
low
chair
with
his
knees
apart
and
his
elbows
propped
on
them
Andrei
Petrovitch
has
your
honour
any
kind
of
plan
for
to-day
It
s
glorious
weather
there
s
a
scent
of
hay
and
dried
strawberries
as
if
one
were
drinking
strawberry-tea
for
a
cold
We
ought
to
get
up
some
kind
of
a
spree
Let
us
show
the
new
inhabitant
of
Kuntsov
all
its
numerous
beauties
Something
has
certainly
upset
him
Bersenyev
kept
thinking
to
himself
Well
why
art
thou
silent
friend
Horatio
Open
your
prophetic
lips
Shall
we
go
off
on
a
spree
or
not
I
don
t
know
how
Insarov
feels
observed
Bersenyev
He
is
just
getting
to
work
I
fancy
Shubin
turned
round
on
his
chair
You
want
to
work
he
inquired
in
a
somewhat
condescending
voice
No
answered
Insarov
to-day
I
could
give
up
to
walking
Ah
commented
Shubin
Well
that
s
delightful
Run
along
my
friend
Andrei
Petrovitch
put
a
hat
on
your
learned
head
and
let
us
go
where
our
eyes
lead
us
Our
eyes
are
young
they
may
lead
us
far
I
know
a
very
repulsive
little
restaurant
where
they
will
give
us
a
very
beastly
little
dinner
but
we
shall
be
very
jolly
Come
along
Half
an
hour
later
they
were
all
three
walking
along
the
bank
of
the
Moskva
Insarov
had
a
rather
queer
cap
with
flaps
over
which
Shubin
fell
into
not
very
spontaneous
raptures
Insarov
walked
without
haste
and
looked
about
breathing
talking
and
smiling
with
the
same
tranquillity
he
was
giving
this
day
up
to
pleasure
and
enjoying
it
to
the
utmost
Just
as
well-behaved
boys
walk
out
on
Sundays
Shubin
whispered
in
Bersenyev
s
ear
Shubin
himself
played
the
fool
a
great
deal
ran
in
front
threw
himself
into
the
attitudes
of
famous
statues
and
turned
somersaults
on
the
grass
Insarov
s
tranquillity
did
not
exactly
irritate
him
but
it
spurred
him
on
to
playing
antics
What
a
fidget
you
are
Frenchman
Bersenyev
said
twice
to
him
Yes
I
am
French
half
French
Shubin
answered
and
you
hold
the
happy
medium
between
jest
and
earnest
as
a
waiter
once
said
to
me
The
young
men
turned
away
from
the
river
and
went
along
a
deep
and
narrow
ravine
between
two
walls
of
tall
golden
rye
a
bluish
shadow
was
cast
on
them
from
the
rye
on
one
side
the
flashing
sunlight
seemed
to
glide
over
the
tops
of
the
ears
the
larks
were
singing
the
quails
were
calling
on
all
sides
was
the
brilliant
green
of
the
grass
a
warm
breeze
stirred
and
lifted
the
leaves
and
shook
the
heads
of
the
flowers
After
prolonged
wanderings
with
rest
and
chat
between
Shubin
had
even
tried
to
play
leap-frog
with
a
toothless
peasant
they
met
who
did
nothing
but
laugh
whatever
the
gentlemen
might
do
to
him
the
young
men
reached
the
repulsive
little
restaurant
the
waiter
almost
knocked
each
of
them
over
and
did
really
provide
them
with
a
very
bad
dinner
with
a
sort
of
Balkan
wine
which
did
not
however
prevent
them
from
being
very
jolly
as
Shubin
had
foretold
he
himself
was
the
loudest
and
the
least
jolly
He
drank
to
the
health
of
the
incomprehensible
but
great
Venelin
the
health
of
the
Bulgarian
king
Kuma
Huma
or
Hroma
who
lived
somewhere
about
the
time
of
Adam
In
the
ninth
century
Insarov
corrected
him
In
the
ninth
century
cried
Shubin
Oh
how
delightful
Bersenyev
noticed
that
among
all
his
pranks
and
jests
and
gaiety
Shubin
was
constantly
as
it
were
examining
Insarov
he
was
sounding
him
and
was
in
inward
excitement
but
Insarov
remained
as
before
calm
and
straightforward
At
last
they
returned
home
changed
their
dress
and
resolved
to
finish
the
day
as
they
had
begun
it
by
going
that
evening
to
the
Stahovs
Shubin
ran
on
before
them
to
announce
their
arrival
The
conquering
hero
Insarov
will
be
here
directly
he
shouted
triumphantly
going
into
the
Stahovs
drawing-room
where
there
happened
at
the
instant
to
be
only
Elena
and
Zoya
Wer
inquired
Zoya
in
German
When
she
was
taken
unawares
she
always
used
her
native
language
Elena
drew
herself
up
Shubin
looked
at
her
with
a
playful
smile
on
his
lips
She
felt
annoyed
but
said
nothing
You
heard
he
repeated
Mr
Insarov
is
coming
here
I
heard
she
replied
and
I
heard
how
you
spoke
of
him
I
am
surprised
at
you
indeed
Mr
Insarov
has
not
yet
set
foot
in
the
house
and
you
already
think
fit
to
turn
him
into
ridicule
Shubin
was
crestfallen
at
once
You
are
right
you
are
always
right
Elena
Nikolaevna
he
muttered
but
I
meant
nothing
on
my
honour
We
have
been
walking
together
with
him
the
whole
day
and
he
s
a
capital
fellow
I
assure
you
I
didn
t
ask
your
opinion
about
that
commented
Elena
getting
up
Is
Mr
Insarov
a
young
man
asked
Zoya
He
is
a
hundred
and
forty-four
replied
Shubin
with
an
air
of
vexation
The
page
announced
the
arrival
of
the
two
friends
They
came
in
Bersenyev
introduced
Insarov
Elena
asked
them
to
sit
down
and
sat
down
herself
while
Zoya
went
off
upstairs
she
had
to
inform
Anna
Vassilyevna
of
their
arrival
A
conversation
was
begun
of
a
rather
insignificant
kind
like
all
first
conversations
Shubin
was
silently
watching
from
a
corner
but
there
was
nothing
to
watch
In
Elena
he
detected
signs
of
repressed
annoyance
against
him
Shubin
and
that
was
all
He
looked
at
Bersenyev
and
at
Insarov
and
compared
their
faces
from
a
sculptor
s
point
of
view
They
are
neither
of
them
good-looking
he
thought
the
Bulgarian
has
a
characteristic
face
there
now
it
s
in
a
good
light
the
Great-Russian
is
better
adapted
for
painting
there
are
no
lines
there
s
expression
But
I
dare
say
one
might
fall
in
love
with
either
of
them
She
is
not
in
love
yet
but
she
will
fall
in
love
with
Bersenyev
he
decided
to
himself
Anna
Vassilyevna
made
her
appearance
in
the
drawing-room
and
the
conversation
took
the
tone
peculiar
to
summer
villas
not
the
country-house
tone
but
the
peculiar
summer
visitor
tone
It
was
a
conversation
diversified
by
plenty
of
subjects
but
broken
by
short
rather
wearisome
pauses
every
three
minutes
In
one
of
these
pauses
Anna
Vassilyevna
turned
to
Zoya
Shubin
understood
her
silent
hint
and
drew
a
long
face
while
Zoya
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
played
and
sang
all
her
pieces
through
Uvar
Ivanovitch
showed
himself
for
an
instant
in
the
doorway
but
he
beat
a
retreat
convulsively
twitching
his
fingers
Then
tea
was
served
and
then
the
whole
party
went
out
into
the
garden
It
began
to
grow
dark
outside
and
the
guests
took
leave
Insarov
had
really
made
less
impression
on
Elena
than
she
had
expected
or
speaking
more
exactly
he
had
not
made
the
impression
she
had
expected
She
liked
his
directness
and
unconstraint
and
she
liked
his
face
but
the
whole
character
of
Insarov
with
his
calm
firmness
and
everyday
simplicity
did
not
somehow
accord
with
the
image
formed
in
her
brain
by
Bersenyev
s
account
of
him
Elena
though
she
did
not
herself
suspect
it
had
anticipated
something
more
fateful
But
she
reflected
he
spoke
very
little
to-day
and
I
am
myself
to
blame
for
it
I
did
not
question
him
we
must
have
patience
till
next
time
and
his
eyes
are
expressive
honest
eyes
She
felt
that
she
had
no
disposition
to
humble
herself
before
him
but
rather
to
hold
out
her
hand
to
him
in
friendly
equality
and
she
was
puzzled
this
was
not
how
she
had
fancied
men
like
Insarov
heroes
This
last
word
reminded
her
of
Shubin
and
she
grew
hot
and
angry
as
she
lay
in
her
bed
How
did
you
like
your
new
acquaintances
Bersenyev
inquired
of
Insarov
on
their
way
home
I
liked
them
very
much
answered
Insarov
especially
the
daughter
She
must
be
a
nice
girl
She
is
excitable
but
in
her
it
s
a
fine
kind
of
excitability
You
must
go
and
see
them
a
little
oftener
observed
Bersenyev
Yes
I
must
said
Insarov
and
he
said
nothing
more
all
the
way
home
He
at
once
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
but
his
candle
was
burning
long
after
midnight
Bersenyev
had
had
time
to
read
a
page
of
Raumer
when
a
handful
of
fine
gravel
came
rattling
on
his
window-pane
He
could
not
help
starting
opening
the
window
he
saw
Shubin
as
white
as
a
sheet
What
an
irrepressible
fellow
you
are
you
night
moth
Bersenyev
was
beginning
Sh
Shubin
cut
him
short
I
have
come
to
you
in
secret
as
Max
went
to
Agatha
I
absolutely
must
say
a
few
words
to
you
alone
Come
into
the
room
then
No
that
s
not
necessary
replied
Shubin
and
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
window-sill
it
s
better
fun
like
this
more
as
if
we
were
in
Spain
To
begin
with
I
congratulate
you
you
re
at
a
premium
now
Your
belauded
exceptional
man
has
quite
missed
fire
That
I
ll
guarantee
And
to
prove
my
impartiality
listen
here
s
the
sum
and
substance
of
Mr
Insarov
No
talents
none
no
poetry
any
amount
of
capacity
for
work
an
immense
memory
an
intellect
not
deep
nor
varied
but
sound
and
quick
dry
as
dust
and
force
and
even
the
gift
of
the
gab
when
the
talk
s
about
his
between
ourselves
let
it
be
said
tedious
Bulgaria
What
do
you
say
I
am
unjust
One
remark
more
you
ll
never
come
to
Christian
names
with
him
and
none
ever
has
been
on
such
terms
with
him
I
of
course
as
an
artist
am
hateful
to
him
and
I
am
proud
of
it
Dry
as
dust
dry
as
dust
but
he
can
crush
all
of
us
to
powder
He
s
devoted
to
his
country
not
like
our
empty
patriots
who
fawn
on
the
people
pour
into
us
they
say
thou
living
water
But
of
course
his
problem
is
easier
more
intelligible
he
has
only
to
drive
the
Turks
out
a
mighty
task
But
all
these
qualities
thank
God
don
t
please
women
There
s
no
fascination
no
charm
about
them
as
there
is
about
you
and
me
Why
do
you
bring
me
in
muttered
Bersenyev
And
you
are
wrong
in
all
the
rest
you
are
not
in
the
least
hateful
to
him
and
with
his
own
countrymen
he
is
on
Christian
name
terms
that
I
know
That
s
a
different
matter
For
them
he
s
a
hero
but
to
make
a
confession
I
have
a
very
different
idea
of
a
hero
a
hero
ought
not
to
be
able
to
talk
a
hero
should
roar
like
a
bull
but
when
he
butts
with
his
horns
the
walls
shake
He
ought
not
to
know
himself
why
he
butts
at
things
but
just
to
butt
at
them
But
perhaps
in
our
days
heroes
of
a
different
stamp
are
needed
Why
are
you
so
taken
up
with
Insarov
asked
Bersenyev
Can
you
have
run
here
only
to
describe
his
character
to
me
I
came
here
began
Shubin
because
I
was
very
miserable
at
home
Oh
that
s
it
Don
t
you
want
to
have
a
cry
again
You
may
laugh
I
came
here
because
I
m
at
my
wits
end
because
I
am
devoured
by
despair
anger
jealousy
Jealousy
of
whom
Of
you
and
him
and
every
one
I
m
tortured
by
the
thought
that
if
I
had
understood
her
sooner
if
I
had
set
to
work
cleverly
But
what
s
the
use
of
talking
It
must
end
by
my
always
laughing
playing
the
fool
turning
things
into
ridicule
as
she
says
and
then
setting
to
and
strangling
myself
Stuff
you
won
t
strangle
yourself
observed
Bersenyev
On
such
a
night
of
course
not
but
only
let
me
live
on
till
the
autumn
On
such
a
night
people
do
die
too
but
only
of
happiness
Ah
happiness
Every
shadow
that
stretches
across
the
road
from
every
tree
seems
whispering
now
I
know
where
there
is
happiness
shall
I
tell
you
I
would
ask
you
to
come
for
a
walk
only
now
you
re
under
the
influence
of
prose
Go
to
sleep
and
may
your
dreams
be
visited
by
mathematical
figures
My
heart
is
breaking
You
worthy
gentlemen
see
a
man
laughing
and
that
means
to
your
notions
he
s
all
right
you
can
prove
to
him
that
he
s
humbugging
himself
that
s
to
say
he
is
not
suffering
God
bless
you
Shubin
abruptly
left
the
window
Annu-shka
Bersenyev
felt
an
impulse
to
shout
after
him
but
he
restrained
himself
Shubin
had
really
been
white
with
emotion
Two
minutes
later
Bersenyev
even
caught
the
sound
of
sobbing
he
got
up
and
opened
the
window
everything
was
still
only
somewhere
in
the
distance
some
one
a
passing
peasant
probably
was
humming
The
Plain
of
Mozdok
During
the
first
fortnight
of
Insarov
s
stay
in
the
Kuntsovo
neighbourhood
he
did
not
visit
the
Stahovs
more
than
four
or
five
times
Bersenyev
went
to
see
them
every
day
Elena
was
always
pleased
to
see
him
lively
and
interesting
talk
always
sprang
up
between
them
and
yet
he
often
went
home
with
a
gloomy
face
Shubin
scarcely
showed
himself
he
was
working
with
feverish
energy
at
his
art
he
either
stayed
locked
up
in
his
room
from
which
he
would
emerge
in
a
blouse
smeared
all
over
with
clay
or
else
he
spent
days
in
Moscow
where
he
had
a
studio
to
which
models
and
Italian
sculptors
his
friends
and
teachers
used
to
come
to
see
him
Elena
did
not
once
succeed
in
talking
with
Insarov
as
she
would
have
liked
to
do
in
his
absence
she
prepared
questions
to
ask
him
about
many
things
but
when
he
came
she
felt
ashamed
of
her
plans
Insarov
s
very
tranquillity
embarrassed
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
not
the
right
to
force
him
to
speak
out
and
she
resolved
to
wait
for
all
that
she
felt
that
at
every
visit
however
trivial
might
be
the
words
that
passed
between
them
he
attracted
her
more
and
more
but
she
never
happened
to
be
left
alone
with
him
and
to
grow
intimate
with
any
one
one
must
have
at
least
one
conversation
alone
with
him
She
talked
a
great
deal
about
him
to
Bersenyev
Bersenyev
realised
that
Elena
s
imagination
had
been
struck
by
Insarov
and
was
glad
that
his
friend
had
not
missed
fire
as
Shubin
had
asserted
He
told
her
cordially
all
he
knew
of
him
down
to
the
minutest
details
we
often
when
we
want
to
please
some
one
bring
our
friends
into
our
conversation
hardly
ever
suspecting
that
we
are
praising
ourselves
in
that
way
and
only
at
times
when
Elena
s
pale
cheeks
flushed
a
little
and
her
eyes
grew
bright
and
wide
he
felt
a
pang
in
his
heart
of
that
evil
pain
which
he
had
felt
before
One
day
Bersenyev
came
to
the
Stahovs
not
at
the
customary
time
but
at
eleven
o
clock
in
the
morning
Elena
came
down
to
him
in
the
parlour
Fancy
he
began
with
a
constrained
smile
our
Insarov
has
disappeared
Disappeared
said
Elena
He
has
disappeared
The
day
before
yesterday
he
went
off
somewhere
and
nothing
has
been
seen
of
him
since
He
did
not
tell
you
where
he
was
going
No
Elena
sank
into
a
chair
He
has
most
likely
gone
to
Moscow
she
commented
trying
to
seem
indifferent
and
at
the
same
time
wondering
that
she
should
try
to
seem
indifferent
I
don
t
think
so
rejoined
Bersenyev
He
did
not
go
alone
With
whom
then
Two
people
of
some
sort
his
countrymen
they
must
have
been
came
to
him
the
day
before
yesterday
before
dinner
Bulgarians
what
makes
you
think
so
Why
as
far
as
I
could
hear
they
talked
to
him
in
some
language
I
did
not
know
but
Slavonic
You
are
always
saying
Elena
Nikolaevna
that
there
s
so
little
mystery
about
Insarov
what
could
be
more
mysterious
than
this
visit
Imagine
they
came
to
him
and
then
there
was
shouting
and
quarrelling
and
such
savage
angry
disputing
And
he
shouted
too
He
shouted
too
Yes
He
shouted
at
them
They
seemed
to
be
accusing
each
other
And
if
you
could
have
had
a
peep
at
these
visitors
They
had
swarthy
heavy
faces
with
high
cheek
bones
and
hook
noses
both
about
forty
years
old
shabbily
dressed
hot
and
dusty
looking
like
workmen
not
workmen
and
not
gentlemen
goodness
knows
what
sort
of
people
they
were
And
he
went
away
with
them
Yes
He
gave
them
something
to
eat
and
went
off
with
them
The
woman
of
the
house
told
me
they
ate
a
whole
huge
pot
of
porridge
between
the
two
of
them
They
outdid
one
another
she
said
and
gobbled
it
up
like
wolves
Elena
gave
a
faint
smile
You
will
see
she
said
all
this
will
be
explained
into
something
very
prosaic
I
hope
it
may
But
you
need
not
use
that
word
There
is
nothing
prosaic
about
Insarov
though
Shubin
does
maintain
Shubin
Elena
broke
in
shrugging
her
shoulders
But
you
must
confess
these
two
good
men
gobbling
up
porridge
Even
Themistocles
had
his
supper
on
the
eve
of
Salamis
observed
Bersenyev
with
a
smile
Yes
but
then
there
was
a
battle
next
day
Any
way
you
will
let
me
know
when
he
comes
back
said
Elena
and
she
tried
to
change
the
subject
but
the
conversation
made
little
progress
Zoya
made
her
appearance
and
began
walking
about
the
room
on
tip-toe
giving
them
thereby
to
understand
that
Anna
Vassilyevna
was
not
yet
awake
Bersenyev
went
away
In
the
evening
of
the
same
day
a
note
from
him
was
brought
to
Elena
He
has
come
back
he
wrote
to
her
sunburnt
and
dusty
to
his
very
eyebrows
but
where
and
why
he
went
I
don
t
know
won
t
you
find
out
Won
t
you
find
out
Elena
whispered
as
though
he
talked
to
me
The
next
day
at
two
o
clock
Elena
was
standing
in
the
garden
before
a
small
kennel
where
she
was
rearing
two
puppies
A
gardener
had
found
them
deserted
under
a
hedge
and
brought
them
to
the
young
mistress
being
told
by
the
laundry-maids
that
she
took
pity
on
beasts
of
all
sorts
He
was
not
wrong
in
his
reckoning
Elena
had
given
him
a
quarter-rouble
She
looked
into
the
kennel
assured
herself
that
the
puppies
were
alive
and
well
and
that
they
had
been
provided
with
fresh
straw
turned
round
and
almost
uttered
a
cry
down
an
alley
straight
towards
her
was
walking
Insarov
alone
Good-morning
he
said
coming
up
to
her
and
taking
off
his
cap
She
noticed
that
he
certainly
had
got
much
sunburnt
during
the
last
three
days
I
meant
to
have
come
here
with
Andrei
Petrovitch
but
he
was
rather
slow
in
starting
so
here
I
am
without
him
There
is
no
one
in
your
house
they
are
all
asleep
or
out
of
doors
so
I
came
on
here
You
seem
to
be
apologising
replied
Elena
There
s
no
need
to
do
that
We
are
always
very
glad
to
see
you
Let
us
sit
here
on
the
bench
in
the
shade
She
seated
herself
Insarov
sat
down
near
her
You
have
not
been
at
home
these
last
days
I
think
she
began
No
he
answered
I
went
away
Did
Andrei
Petrovitch
tell
you
Insarov
looked
at
her
smiled
and
began
playing
with
his
cap
When
he
smiled
his
eyes
blinked
and
his
lips
puckered
up
which
gave
him
a
very
good-humoured
appearance
Andrei
Petrovitch
most
likely
told
you
too
that
I
went
away
with
some
unattractive
people
he
said
still
smiling
Elena
was
a
little
confused
but
she
felt
at
once
that
Insarov
must
always
be
told
the
truth
Yes
she
said
decisively
What
did
you
think
of
me
he
asked
her
suddenly
Elena
raised
her
eyes
to
him
I
thought
she
said
I
thought
that
you
always
know
what
you
re
doing
and
you
are
incapable
of
doing
anything
wrong
Well
thanks
for
that
You
see
Elena
Nikolaevna
he
began
coming
closer
to
her
in
a
confidential
way
there
is
a
little
family
of
our
people
here
among
us
there
are
men
of
little
culture
but
all
are
warmly
devoted
to
the
common
cause
Unluckily
one
can
never
get
on
without
dissensions
and
they
all
know
me
and
trust
me
so
they
sent
for
me
to
settle
a
dispute
I
went
Was
it
far
from
here
I
went
about
fifty
miles
to
the
Troitsky
district
There
near
the
monastery
there
are
some
of
our
people
At
any
rate
my
trouble
was
not
thrown
away
I
settled
the
matter
And
had
you
much
difficulty
Yes
One
was
obstinate
through
everything
He
did
not
want
to
give
back
the
money
What
Was
the
dispute
over
money
Yes
and
a
small
sum
of
money
too
What
did
you
suppose
And
you
travelled
over
fifty
miles
for
such
trifling
matters
Wasted
three
days
They
are
not
trifling
matters
Elena
Nikolaevna
when
my
countrymen
are
involved
It
would
be
wicked
to
refuse
in
such
cases
I
see
here
that
you
don
t
refuse
help
even
to
puppies
and
I
think
well
of
you
for
it
And
as
for
the
time
I
have
lost
that
s
no
great
harm
I
will
make
it
up
later
Our
time
does
not
belong
to
us
To
whom
does
it
belong
then
Why
to
all
who
need
us
I
have
told
you
all
this
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
because
I
value
your
good
opinion
I
can
fancy
how
Andrei
Petrovitch
must
have
made
you
wonder
You
value
my
good
opinion
said
Elena
in
an
undertone
why
Insarov
smiled
again
Because
you
are
a
good
young
lady
not
an
aristocrat
that
s
all
A
short
silence
followed
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
said
Elena
do
you
know
that
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
been
so
unreserved
with
me
How
s
that
I
think
I
have
always
said
everything
I
thought
to
you
No
this
is
the
first
time
and
I
am
very
glad
and
I
too
want
to
be
open
with
you
May
I
Insarov
began
to
laugh
and
said
You
may
I
warn
you
I
am
very
inquisitive
Never
mind
tell
me
Andrei
Petrovitch
has
told
me
a
great
deal
of
your
life
of
your
youth
I
know
of
one
event
one
awful
event
I
know
you
travelled
afterwards
in
your
own
country
Don
t
answer
me
for
goodness
sake
if
you
think
my
question
indiscreet
but
I
am
fretted
by
one
idea
Tell
me
did
you
meet
that
man
Elena
caught
her
breath
She
felt
both
shame
and
dismay
at
her
own
audacity
Insarov
looked
at
her
intently
slightly
knitting
his
brows
and
stroking
his
chin
with
his
fingers
Elena
Nikolaevna
he
began
at
last
and
his
voice
was
much
lower
than
usual
which
almost
frightened
Elena
I
understand
what
man
you
are
referring
to
No
I
did
not
meet
him
and
thank
God
I
did
not
I
did
not
try
to
find
him
I
did
not
try
to
find
him
not
because
I
did
not
think
I
had
a
right
to
kill
him
I
would
kill
him
with
a
very
easy
conscience
but
because
now
is
not
the
time
for
private
revenge
when
we
are
concerned
with
the
general
national
vengeance
or
no
that
is
not
the
right
word
when
we
are
concerned
with
the
liberation
of
a
people
The
one
would
be
a
hindrance
to
the
other
In
its
own
time
that
too
will
come
that
too
will
come
he
repeated
and
he
shook
his
head
Elena
looked
at
him
from
the
side
You
love
your
country
very
dearly
she
articulated
timidly
That
remains
to
be
shown
he
answered
When
one
of
us
dies
for
her
then
one
can
say
he
loved
his
country
So
that
if
you
were
cut
off
all
chance
of
returning
to
Bulgaria
continued
Elena
would
you
be
very
unhappy
in
Russia
Insarov
looked
down
I
think
I
could
not
bear
that
he
said
Tell
me
Elena
began
again
is
it
difficult
to
learn
Bulgarian
Not
at
all
It
s
a
disgrace
to
a
Russian
not
to
know
Bulgarian
A
Russian
ought
to
know
all
the
Slavonic
dialects
Would
you
like
me
to
bring
you
some
Bulgarian
books
You
will
see
how
easy
it
is
What
ballads
we
have
equal
to
the
Servian
But
stop
a
minute
I
will
translate
to
you
one
of
them
It
is
about
But
you
know
a
little
of
our
history
at
least
don
t
you
No
I
know
nothing
of
it
answered
Elena
Wait
a
little
and
I
will
bring
you
a
book
You
will
learn
the
principal
facts
at
least
from
it
Listen
to
the
ballad
then
But
I
had
better
bring
you
a
written
translation
though
I
am
sure
you
will
love
us
you
love
all
the
oppressed
If
you
knew
what
a
land
of
plenty
ours
is
And
meanwhile
it
has
been
downtrodden
it
has
been
ravaged
he
went
on
with
an
involuntary
movement
of
his
arm
and
his
face
darkened
we
have
been
robbed
of
everything
everything
our
churches
our
laws
our
lands
the
unclean
Turks
drive
us
like
cattle
butcher
us
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
cried
Elena
He
stopped
I
beg
your
pardon
I
can
t
speak
of
this
coolly
But
you
asked
me
just
now
whether
I
love
my
country
What
else
can
one
love
on
earth
What
is
the
one
thing
unchanging
what
is
above
all
doubts
what
is
it
next
to
God
one
must
believe
in
And
when
that
country
needs
Think
the
poorest
peasant
the
poorest
beggar
in
Bulgaria
and
I
have
the
same
desire
All
of
us
have
one
aim
You
can
understand
what
strength
what
confidence
that
gives
Insarov
was
silent
for
an
instant
then
he
began
again
to
talk
of
Bulgaria
Elena
listened
to
him
with
absorbed
profound
and
mournful
attention
When
he
had
finished
she
asked
him
once
more
Then
you
would
not
stay
in
Russia
for
anything
And
when
he
went
away
for
a
long
time
she
gazed
after
him
On
that
day
he
had
become
a
different
man
for
her
When
she
walked
back
with
him
through
the
garden
he
was
no
longer
the
man
she
had
met
two
hours
before
From
that
day
he
began
to
come
more
and
more
often
and
Bersenyev
less
and
less
often
A
strange
feeling
began
to
grow
up
between
the
two
friends
of
which
they
were
both
conscious
but
to
which
they
could
not
give
a
name
and
which
they
feared
to
analyse
In
this
way
a
month
passed
Anna
Vassilyevna
as
the
reader
knows
already
liked
staying
at
home
but
at
times
she
manifested
quite
unexpectedly
an
irresistible
longing
for
something
out
of
the
common
some
extraordinary
partie
du
plaisir
and
the
more
troublesome
the
partie
du
plaisir
was
the
more
preparations
and
arrangements
it
required
and
the
greater
Anna
Vassilyevna
s
own
agitation
over
it
the
more
pleasure
it
gave
her
If
this
mood
came
upon
her
in
winter
she
would
order
two
or
three
boxes
to
be
taken
side
by
side
and
inviting
all
her
acquaintances
would
set
off
to
the
theatre
or
even
to
a
masquerade
in
summer
she
would
drive
for
a
trip
out
of
town
to
some
spot
as
far
off
as
possible
The
next
day
she
would
complain
of
a
headache
groan
and
keep
her
bed
but
within
two
months
the
same
craving
for
something
out
of
the
common
would
break
out
in
her
again
That
was
just
what
happened
now
Some
one
chanced
to
refer
to
the
beautiful
scenery
of
Tsaritsino
before
her
and
Anna
Vassilyevna
suddenly
announced
an
intention
of
driving
to
Tsaritsino
the
day
after
tomorrow
The
household
was
thrown
into
a
state
of
bustle
a
messenger
galloped
off
to
Moscow
for
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
with
him
galloped
the
butler
to
buy
wines
pies
and
all
sorts
of
provisions
Shubin
was
commissioned
to
hire
an
open
carriage
the
coach
alone
was
not
enough
and
to
order
relays
of
horses
to
be
ready
