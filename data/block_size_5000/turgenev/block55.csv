men
were
running
with
lanterns
Vladimir
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Sergeitch
went
quickly
to
the
door
opened
it
and
ran
straight
into
Ivan
Ilyitch
Pale
dis
hevelled
and
half-dressed
the
latter
was
rush
ing
along
without
knowing
where
he
was
going
What
is
it
What
has
happened
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
in
excitement
clutching
vig
orously
at
his
arm
She
is
lost
she
is
drowned
she
has
thrown
herself
into
the
water
Ivan
Ilyitch
responded
in
a
breathless
voice
Who
is
in
the
water
who
is
lost
Marya
Pavlovna
Who
else
could
it
be
He
has
been
the
death
of
her
poor
darling
Help
Run
good
people
make
haste
Make
haste
lads
And
Ivan
Ilyitch
dashed
down
the
stairs
Vladimir
Sergeitch
got
into
his
boots
flung
his
greatcoat
over
his
shoulders
and
ran
after
him
He
found
no
one
in
the
house
they
had
all
rushed
into
the
garden
only
the
little
girls
Ipatov
's
daughters
met
him
in
the
passage
close
to
the
front
door
half
dead
with
fright
they
were
standing
in
their
white
petticoats
with
clasped
hands
and
bare
feet
near
a
night
light
on
the
ground
Vladimir
Sergeitch
ran
through
the
drawing-room
passing
an
over
turned
table
on
to
the
verandah
Through
the
shrubbery
in
the
direction
of
the
dam
lights
were
gleaming
and
shadows
were
fleeting
The
hooks
Run
for
the
hooks
he
heard
the
voice
of
Ipatov
The
net
the
net
The
boat
cried
other
voices
Vladimir
Sergeitch
ran
towards
the
shouts
He
found
Ipatov
on
the
bank
of
the
pond
a
lantern
hung
on
a
branch
threw
a
vivid
light
on
the
old
man
's
grey
head
He
was
wringing
his
hands
and
staggering
as
though
he
were
drunk
on
the
grass
near
him
a
woman
was
writhing
and
sobbing
people
were
running
to
and
fro
Ivan
Ilyitch
was
already
up
to
his
knees
in
the
water
and
feeling
the
depth
with
a
pole
the
coachman
was
undressing
shivering
all
over
two
men
were
dragging
a
boat
along
the
bank
the
rapid
thud
of
horses
hoofs
could
be
heard
along
the
village
street
The
wind
blew
shrieking
as
though
doing
its
utmost
to
put
out
the
lanterns
The
waters
of
the
black
and
menacing
pond
splashed
noisily
on
the
bank
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
What
do
I
hear
cried
Vladimir
Sergeitch
running
up
to
Ipatov
Is
it
possible
The
hooks
Quick
the
hooks
moaned
the
old
man
in
reply
But
perhaps
you
are
mistaken
Mihail
Niko
laitch
No
how
can
it
be
a
mistake
the
woman
lying
on
the
grass
Marya
Pavlovna
's
maid
said
in
a
tearful
voice
wretch
that
I
am
I
heard
her
myself
jump
into
the
water
cry
out
'Save
me
and
then
once
mare
'Save
me
How
was
it
you
did
not
prevent
her
How
could
I
prevent
her
sir
Why
by
the
time
I
missed
her
she
was
gone
but
I
must
have
had
a
foreboding
in
my
heart
the
last
few
days
she
has
been
in
such
grief
and
did
not
say
a
word
but
I
knew
and
I
ran
straight
into
the
garden
as
though
someone
had
told
me
All
at
once
I
heard
something
go
plop
into
the
water
'Save
me
I
heard
her
cry
'save
me
Oh
dear
kind
people
But
perhaps
it
was
your
fancy
My
fancy
indeed
And
where
is
she
then
What
has
become
of
her
So
that
was
the
white
thing
I
thought
I
saw
in
the
darkness
thought
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Meanwhile
men
had
run
up
with
hooks
brought
a
net
and
begun
laying
it
out
on
the
grass
numbers
of
people
came
up
there
was
a
great
running
to
and
fro
the
coachman
snatched
up
a
hook
the
village
elder
another
they
both
jumped
into
the
boat
pushed
off
and
began
dragging
the
water
with
the
hooks
they
were
lighted
from
the
bank
Their
movements
and
their
shadows
seemed
strange
and
terrible
in
the
darkness
on
the
troubled
water
in
the
dim
and
uncertain
light
of
the
lantern
It
's
caught
the
coachman
cried
suddenly
Everyone
stood
faint
with
expectation
A
stump
said
the
coachman
and
pulled
out
the
hook
Come
back
come
back
they
shouted
from
the
bank
you
will
do
nothing
with
the
hooks
you
want
the
net
Yes
yes
the
net
others
chimed
in
Stay
cried
the
village
elder
my
hook
has
caught
too
I
think
it
's
something
soft
he
added
a
little
later
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
A
patch
of
white
came
into
sight
near
the
boat
The
young
lady
cried
the
village
elder
It
's
she
He
was
right
the
hook
had
caught
Marya
Pavlovna
by
the
sleeve
of
her
dress
The
coachman
got
hold
of
her
at
once
they
drew
her
out
of
the
water
with
two
strong
strokes
the
boat
was
brought
to
the
bank
Ipatov
Ivan
Ilyitch
Vladimir
Serge
itch
all
rushed
to
Marya
Pavlovna
lifted
her
up
and
carried
her
home
in
their
arms
They
undressed
her
warmed
her
and
tried
to
restore
respiration
But
all
their
efforts
were
in
vain
Marya
Pavlovna
did
not
come
to
her
self
Life
had
fled
Next
morning
early
Vladimir
Sergeitch
left
Ipatovka
before
he
set
off
he
went
to
take
the
last
farewell
of
the
dead
girl
She
was
lying
on
the
table
in
the
drawing-room
in
a
white
dress
Her
thick
hair
was
hardly
dry
there
was
a
look
of
sorrowful
bewilderment
on
her
pale
face
which
was
still
unchanged
her
parted
lips
seemed
striving
to
speak
and
ask
some
question
her
crossed
arms
seemed
pressing
on
her
bosom
as
though
in
anguish
But
with
whatever
bitter
thoughts
the
poor
girl
had
7
perished
death
had
laid
upon
her
its
imprint
of
eternal
silence
and
resignation
And
who
can
say
what
the
dead
face
expresses
in
those
few
moments
when
for
the
last
time
it
meets
the
eyes
of
the
living
before
vanishing
forever
and
perishing
in
the
grave
Vladimir
Sergeitch
stood
in
decorous
melan
choly
before
the
body
of
Marya
Pavlovna
crossed
himself
three
times
and
went
out
with
out
noticing
Ivan
Ilyitch
who
was
quietly
weep
ing
in
the
corner
And
he
was
not
the
only
one
who
wept
that
day
all
the
servants
in
the
house
wept
bitterly
nothing
but
good
was
remembered
of
Marya
Pavlovna
A
week
later
old
Ipatov
wrote
as
follows
in
reply
to
a
letter
that
had
come
at
last
from
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
A
week
ago
dear
Madam
Nadyezhda
Alex
yevna
my
sister-in-law
your
friend
Marya
Pavlovna
made
an
end
of
her
life
by
throwing
herself
at
night
into
the
pond
and
we
have
al
ready
consigned
her
body
to
the
earth
She
took
this
grievous
and
terrible
step
without
saying
good-bye
to
me
without
leaving
a
letter
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
or
the
smallest
note
to
convey
her
last
wishes
But
you
know
better
than
anyone
Nad
yezhda
Alexyevna
on
whose
soul
this
great
and
mortal
sin
should
fall
May
the
Lord
be
your
brother
's
judge
but
my
sister-in-law
could
neither
forget
him
nor
survive
the
separation
By
the
time
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
received
this
letter
she
was
in
Italy
where
she
had
gone
with
her
husband
Count
de
Steltchinsky
as
he
was
styled
in
all
the
hotels
It
was
not
only
the
hotels
he
visited
however
he
was
fre
quently
seen
in
gambling
saloons
in
the
Kur
saals
in
watering
places
At
first
he
lost
a
great
deal
of
money
then
left
oflF
losing
and
his
face
assumed
the
peculiar
expression
half
suspicious
half
impudent
which
is
seen
in
a
man
liable
to
being
suddenly
involved
in
some
unpleasant
affray
He
rarely
saw
his
wife
Nadyezhda
Alexyevna
was
not
dull
in
his
ab
sence
however
She
developed
a
taste
for
the
arts
Her
acquaintances
chiefly
consisted
of
artists
and
she
liked
discussing
the
beautiful
with
young
men
Ipatov
's
letter
grieved
her
extremely
but
did
not
prevent
her
from
going
XA
the
same
day
to
the
Cave
of
Dogs
to
watch
unfortunate
animals
gasp
for
breath
as
they
were
plunged
into
sulphurous
fumes
She
did
not
go
alone
She
was
accompanied
by
several
admirers
Among
them
the
most
amiable
was
considered
to
be
Mr
Popelin
an
unsuccessful
French
painter
with
a
beard
and
a
check
jacket
He
sang
the
newest
songs
in
a
thin
tenor
made
jokes
in
a
very
free-and
easy
style
and
ate
a
very
great
deal
though
he
was
very
lean
CHAPTER
VII
It
was
a
sunny
frosty
day
in
January
num
bers
of
people
were
walking
along
the
Nevsky
The
clock
on
the
tower
of
the
Town
Hall
struck
three
Our
old
acquaintance
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Astahov
was
walking
among
others
on
the
broad
flags
sprinkled
with
yellow
sand
He
had
grown
much
more
manly
looking
since
we
parted
from
him
he
had
grown
whiskers
and
was
stouter
all
over
but
did
not
look
older
He
followed
the
crowd
without
haste
from
time
to
time
looking
about
him
he
was
ex
pecting
his
wife
she
had
meant
to
drive
up
in
their
carriage
with
her
mother
It
was
about
five
years
since
Vladimir
Sergeitch
had
mar
ried
exactly
as
he
wished
his
wife
was
wealthy
and
with
the
best
connections
Aflfably
lifting
his
superbly
brushed
hat
as
he
met
his
numer
ous
acquaintances
Vladimir
Sergeitch
moved
forward
with
the
free
step
of
a
man
satisfied
with
his
lot
All
at
once
close
to
the
Arcade
he
was
almost
run
into
by
a
man
in
a
Spanish
cloak
and
a
jockey
cap
his
face
was
rather
the
worse
for
wear
his
moustache
was
dyed
and
his
big
eyes
looked
out
from
swollen
and
puffy
eyelids
Vladimir
Sergeitch
moved
aside
with
dignity
but
the
gentleman
in
the
cap
stared
at
him
and
suddenly
exclaimed
Ah
Mr
Astahov
how
are
you
Vladimir
Sergeitch
made
no
reply
and
stood
still
in
amazement
He
could
not
imagine
how
a
gentleman
who
had
the
temerity
to
appear
on
the
Nevsky
in
a
jockey
cap
knew
his
surname
You
do
n't
recognise
me
the
gentleman
in
the
cap
went
on
I
saw
you
eight
years
ago
in
the
country
in
T
province
at
the
Ipatovs
My
name
is
Veretyev
Oh
dear
I
beg
your
pardon
exclaimed
Vladimir
Sergeitch
but
how
you
have
changed
Yes
I
am
older
answered
Pyotr
Alexe
itch
and
he
passed
over
his
face
a
hand
with
out
a
glove
but
you
now
have
not
changed
Veretyev
did
not
so
much
look
older
as
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
fallen
off
and
deteriorated
Tiny
delicate
wrinkles
covered
his
whole
face
and
when
he
talked
his
lips
and
cheeks
twitched
slightly
Everything
about
him
indicated
that
he
had
been
living
hard
y
Where
have
you
been
lost
all
this
time
that
one
has
seen
nothing
of
you
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
I
have
been
wandering
about
And
have
you
been
in
Petersburg
all
the
time
For
the
most
part
in
Petersburg
Are
you
married
Yes
And
Vladimir
Sergeitch
assumed
a
rather
severe
air
as
though
to
say
to
Veretyev
Don't
venture
to
ask
me
my
good
fellow
to
introduce
you
to
my
wife
Veretyev
seemed
to
understand
him
A
care
less
smile
faintly
stirred
his
lips
And
how
is
your
sister
asked
Vladimir
Sergeitch
Where
is
she
I
ra
n't
tell
you
for
certain
I
expect
she
is
in
Moscow
I
have
not
had
a
letter
from
her
for
a
long
time
And
is
her
husband
living
Yes
And
Mr
Ipatov
himself
I
do
n't
know
I
expect
he
is
alive
too
but
he
may
be
dead
And
that
other
gentleman
what
was
his
name
Bodryakov
was
n't
it
The
one
you
asked
to
be
your
second
do
you
remember
when
you
were
in
such
a
funk
The
devil
only
knows
Vladimir
Sergeitch
with
a
dignified
face
re
mained
silent
I
always
recall
with
pleasure
those
eve
nings
he
continued
when
I
had
the
oppor
tunity
he
had
almost
said
'honour
of
mak
ing
the
acquaintance
of
your
sister
and
your
self
She
is
a
very
charming
person
Do
you
still
sing
as
agreeably
No
I
've
lost
my
voice
Yes
that
was
a
nice
time
I
visited
Ipatovka
once
since
Vladimir
Sergeitch
went
on
raising
his
eyebrows
mourn
fully
I
think
that
was
what
they
called
the
village
on
the
very
day
of
a
terrible
event
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
Yes
yes
that
was
horrible
horrible
Veret
yev
hurriedly
interrupted
him
Yes
yes
and
do
you
remember
how
you
almost
fought
a
duel
with
my
present
brother-in-law
H
'm
Yes
I
remember
Vladimir
Serge
itch
replied
deliberately
However
I
must
confess
it
is
so
long
ago
that
it
all
seems
to
me
rather
like
a
dream
now
Like
a
dream
Veretyev
repeated
and
his
pale
cheeks
flushed
like
a
dream
no
it
was
not
a
dream
not
for
me
anyway
It
was
the
time
of
youth
of
gaiety
of
happiness
the
time
of
boundless
hopes
and
unconquerable
strength
and
if
it
was
a
dream
it
was
a
lovely
dream
But
that
we
have
grown
old
and
stupid
and
dye
our
moustache
and
lounge
about
the
Nevsky
and
are
good
for
nothing
like
broken-down
hacks
that
we
have
lost
our
savour
have
worn
threadbare
whether
we
are
stuck
up
and
dignified
or
whether
we
are
simply
loafers
and
very
likely
drown
our
sorrow
in
wine
that
is
more
like
a
dream
and
a
most
hideous
dream
Our
life
has
been
lived
and
lived
in
vain
absurdly
vulgarly
that
's
what
is
bitter
If
only
one
could
sliake
that
off
like
a
dream
if
only
one
could
wake
up
from
that
And
then
everywhere
always
one
awful
memory
one
phantom
But
good-bye
Veretyev
moved
rapidly
away
but
on
reach
ing
the
doors
of
one
of
the
principal
cafes
of
the
Nevsky
Prospect
stopped
went
in
and
tossing
off
at
the
bar
a
glass
of
orange
bitters
he
crossed
the
billiard-room
dark
and
foggy
with
tobacco
fumes
and
went
into
a
back
room
There
he
found
some
friends
old
comrades
Petya
Lasurin
Kostya
Kovrovsky
Prince
Ser
dyukov
and
two
gentlemen
who
were
addressed
simply
as
Vasyuk
and
Filat
They
were
all
men
no
longer
young
though
unmarried
some
were
a
little
bald
others
were
turning
grey
they
had
wrinkled
faces
and
double
chins
in
short
these
gentlemen
had
all
as
they
say
be
gun
going
to
seed
They
all
however
still
looked
upon
Veretyev
as
an
exceptional
man
destined
to
astonish
the
world
and
he
was
more
intelligent
only
in
that
he
was
very
well
aware
of
his
complete
and
essential
uselessness
And
even
outside
his
own
circle
there
were
people
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
who
thought
of
him
that
if
he
had
not
ruined
himself
something
very
remarkable
might
have
come
of
him
These
people
were
mistaken
nothing
ever
does
come
of
the
Veretyevs
y
Pyotr
Alexeitch
's
friends
met
him
with
their
usual
greetings
He
puzzled
them
at
first
by
his
gloomy
expression
and
bitter
remarks
but
he
soon
recovered
grew
merry
and
things
went
as
usual
As
soon
as
Veretyev
left
him
Vladimir
Sergeitch
frowned
and
drew
himself
up
Pyotr
Alexeitch
's
sudden
outburst
had
greatly
per
plexed
and
even
offended
him
Grown
stupid
drink
dye
our
moustache
paries
pour
vous
mon
cher
he
said
at
last
almost
aloud
and
snorting
once
or
twice
with
involuntary
indignation
was
about
to
con
tinue
his
walk
Who
was
that
talking
to
you
he
heard
a
loud
and
self-confident
voice
behind
him
Vladimir
Sergeitch
turned
round
and
saw
one
of
his
intimate
friends
a
certain
Mr
Pom
ponsky
This
Mr
Pomponsky
a
tall
and
stout
gentleman
held
a
rather
important
post
and
Z^7
had
never
once
even
in
his
early
youth
had
the
slightest
doubt
of
his
own
efficiency
Oh
a
queer
fellow
said
Vladimir
Serge
itch
taking
Pomponsky
's
arm
Upon
my
soul
Vladimir
Sergeitch
is
it
pos
sible
for
a
gentleman
to
be
seen
talking
in
the
street
to
an
individual
in
a
jockey
cap
It's
unseemly
I
am
amazed
Where
could
you
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
person
In
the
country
In
the

Country

not

ce

A
gentleman
must
always
behave
like
a
gentleman
if
he
wants
Here
is
my
wife
Vladimir
Sergeitch
made
haste
to
interrupt
him
Let
us
go
to
her
And
the
two
gentlemen
made
their
way
to
a
smart
low
carriage
from
the
window
of
which
the
pale
fatigued
and
irritably
haughty
face
of
a
woman
still
young
but
already
a
little
faded
was
looking
out
Another
lady
who
also
seemed
cross
her
mother
could
be
seen
behind
her
Vladimir
Sergeitch
opened
the
carriage
door
and
gave
his
A
QUIET
BACKWATER
wife
his
arm
Pomponsky
approached
the
mother-in-law
and
both
couples
walked
along
the
Nevsky
accompanied
by
a
short
black
haired
footman
in
greenish
gaiters
with
a
big
cockade
on
his
hat
A
bright
spring
day
was
fading
into
evening
High
overhead
in
the
clear
heavens
small
rosy
clouds
seemed
hardly
to
move
across
the
sky
but
to
be
sinking
into
its
depths
of
blue
In
a
handsome
house
in
one
of
the
outlying
streets
of
the
government
town
of
O
it
was
in
the
year
1842
two
women
were
sitting
at
an
open
window
one
was
about
fifty
the
other
an
old
lady
of
seventy
The
name
of
the
former
was
Marya
Dmitrievna
Kalitin
Her
husband
a
shrewd
determined
man
of
obstinate
bilious
temperament
had
been
dead
for
ten
years
He
had
been
a
provincial
public
prosecutor
noted
in
his
own
day
as
a
successful
man
of
business
He
had
received
a
fair
education
and
had
been
to
the
university
but
having
been
born
in
narrow
circumstances
he
realized
early
in
life
the
necessity
of
pushing
his
own
way
in
the
world
and
making
money
It
had
been
a
love-match
on
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
side
He
was
not
bad-looking
was
clever
and
could
be
very
agreeable
when
he
chose
Marya
Dmitrievna
Pesto
that
was
her
maiden
name
had
lost
her
parents
in
childhood
She
spent
some
years
in
a
boarding-school
in
Moscow
and
after
leaving
school
lived
on
the
family
estate
of
Pokrovskoe
about
forty
miles
from
O
with
her
aunt
and
her
elder
brother
This
brother
soon
after
obtained
a
post
in
Petersburg
and
made
them
a
scanty
allowance
He
treated
his
aunt
and
sister
very
shabbily
till
his
sudden
death
cut
short
his
career
Marya
Dmitrievna
inherited
Pokrovskoe
but
she
did
not
live
there
long
Two
years
after
her
marriage
with
Kalitin
who
succeeded
in
winning
her
heart
in
a
few
days
Pokrovskoe
was
exchanged
for
another
estate
which
yielded
a
much
larger
income
but
was
utterly
unattractive
and
had
no
house
At
the
same
time
Kalitin
took
a
house
in
the
town
of
O
in
which
he
and
his
wife
took
up
their
permanent
abode
There
was
a
large
garden
round
the
house
which
on
one
side
looked
out
upon
the
open
country
away
from
the
town
And
so
decided
Kalitin
who
had
a
great
distaste
for
the
quiet
of
country
life
there
would
be
no
need
for
them
to
be
dragging
themselves
off
into
the
country
In
her
heart
Marya
Dmitrievna
more
than
once
regretted
her
pretty
Pokrovskoe
with
its
babbling
brook
its
wide
meadows
and
green
copses
but
she
never
opposed
her
husband
in
anything
and
had
the
greatest
veneration
for
his
wisdom
and
knowledge
of
the
world
When
after
fifteen
years
of
married
life
he
died
leaving
her
with
a
son
and
two
daughters
Marya
Dmitrievna
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
her
house
and
to
town
life
that
she
had
no
inclination
to
leave
O
In
her
youth
Marya
Dmitrievna
had
always
been
spoken
of
as
a
pretty
blonde
and
at
fifty
her
features
had
not
lost
all
charm
though
they
were
somewhat
coarser
and
less
delicate
in
outline
She
was
more
sentimental
than
kindhearted
and
even
at
her
mature
age
she
retained
the
manners
of
the
boarding-school
She
was
self-indulgent
and
easily
put
out
even
moved
to
tears
when
she
was
crossed
in
any
of
her
habits
She
was
however
very
sweet
and
agreeable
when
all
her
wishes
were
carried
out
and
none
opposed
her
Her
house
was
among
the
pleasantest
in
the
town
She
had
a
considerable
fortune
not
so
much
from
her
own
property
as
from
her
husband
s
savings
Her
two
daughters
were
living
with
her
her
son
was
being
educated
in
one
of
the
best
government
schools
in
Petersburg
The
old
lady
sitting
with
Marya
Dmitrievna
at
the
window
was
her
father
s
sister
the
same
aunt
with
whom
she
had
once
spent
some
solitary
years
in
Pokrovskoe
Her
name
was
Marfa
Timofyevna
Pestov
She
had
a
reputation
for
eccentricity
as
she
was
a
woman
of
an
independent
character
told
every
one
the
truth
to
his
face
and
even
in
the
most
straitened
circumstances
behaved
just
as
if
she
had
a
fortune
at
her
disposal
She
could
not
endure
Kalitin
and
directly
her
niece
married
him
she
removed
to
her
little
property
where
for
ten
whole
years
she
lived
in
a
smoky
peasants
hut
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
a
little
afraid
of
her
A
little
sharp-nosed
woman
with
black
hair
and
keen
eyes
even
in
her
old
age
Marfa
Timofyevna
walked
briskly
held
herself
upright
and
spoke
quickly
and
clearly
in
a
sharp
ringing
voice
She
always
wore
a
white
cap
and
a
white
dressing-jacket
What
s
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
Marya
Dmitrievna
suddenly
What
are
you
sighing
about
pray
Nothing
answered
the
latter
What
exquisite
clouds
You
feel
sorry
for
them
eh
Marya
Dmitrievna
made
no
reply
Why
is
it
Gedeonovsky
does
not
come
observed
Marfa
Timofyevna
moving
her
knitting
needles
quickly
She
was
knitting
a
large
woolen
scarf
He
would
have
sighed
with
you
or
at
least
he
d
have
had
some
fib
to
tell
you
How
hard
you
always
are
on
him
Sergei
Petrovitch
is
a
worthy
man
Worthy
repeated
the
old
lady
scornfully
And
how
devoted
he
was
to
my
poor
husband
observed
Marya
Dmitrievna
even
now
he
can
not
speak
of
him
without
emotion
And
no
wonder
It
was
he
who
picked
him
out
of
the
gutter
muttered
Marfa
Timofyevna
and
her
knitting
needles
moved
faster
than
ever
He
looks
so
meek
and
mild
she
began
again
with
his
grey
head
but
he
no
sooner
opens
his
mouth
than
out
comes
a
lie
or
a
slander
And
to
think
of
his
having
the
rank
of
a
councillor
To
be
sure
though
he
s
only
a
village
priest
s
son
Every
one
has
faults
auntie
that
is
his
weak
point
no
doubt
Sergei
Petrovitch
has
had
no
education
of
course
he
does
not
speak
French
still
say
what
you
like
he
is
an
agreeable
man
Yes
he
is
always
ready
to
kiss
your
hands
He
does
not
speak
French
that
s
no
great
loss
I
am
not
over
strong
in
the
French
lingo
myself
It
would
be
better
if
he
could
not
speak
at
all
he
would
not
tell
lies
then
But
here
he
is
speak
of
the
devil
added
Marfa
Timofyevna
looking
into
the
street
Here
comes
your
agreeable
man
striding
along
What
a
lanky
creature
he
is
just
like
a
stork
Marya
Dmitrievna
began
to
arrange
her
curls
Marfa
Timofyevna
looked
at
her
ironically
What
s
that
not
a
grey
hair
surely
You
must
speak
to
your
Palashka
what
can
she
be
thinking
about
Really
auntie
you
are
always
so
muttered
Marya
Dmitrievna
in
a
tone
of
vexation
drumming
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
with
her
finger-tips
Sergei
Petrovitch
Gedeonovsky
was
announced
in
a
shrill
piping
voice
by
a
rosy-cheeked
little
page
who
made
his
appearance
at
the
door
A
tall
man
entered
wearing
a
tidy
overcoat
rather
short
trousers
grey
doeskin
gloves
and
two
neckties
a
black
one
outside
and
a
white
one
below
it
There
was
an
air
of
decorum
and
propriety
in
everything
about
him
from
his
prosperous
countenance
and
smoothly
brushed
hair
to
his
low-heeled
noiseless
boots
He
bowed
first
to
the
lady
of
the
house
then
to
Marfa
Timofyevna
and
slowly
drawing
off
his
gloves
he
advanced
to
take
Marya
Dmitrievna
s
hand
After
kissing
it
respectfully
twice
he
seated
himself
with
deliberation
in
an
arm-chair
and
rubbing
the
very
tips
of
his
fingers
together
he
observed
with
a
smile
And
is
Elisaveta
Mihalovna
quite
well
Yes
replied
Marya
Dmitrievna
she
s
in
the
garden
And
Elena
Mihalovna
Lenotchka
s
in
the
garden
too
Is
there
no
news
There
is
indeed
replied
the
visitor
slowly
blinking
his
eyes
and
pursing
up
his
mouth
Hm
yes
indeed
there
is
a
piece
of
news
and
very
surprising
news
too
Lavretsky
Fedor
Ivanitch
is
here
Fedya
cried
Marfa
Timofyevna
Are
you
sure
you
are
not
romancing
my
good
man
No
indeed
I
saw
him
myself
Well
that
does
not
prove
it
Fedor
Ivanitch
looked
much
more
robust
continued
Gedeonovsky
affecting
not
to
have
heard
Marfa
Timofyevna
s
last
remark
Fedor
Ivanitch
is
broader
and
has
quite
a
colour
He
looked
more
robust
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
dwelling
on
each
syllable
I
should
have
thought
he
had
little
enough
to
make
him
look
robust
Yes
indeed
observed
Gedeonovsky
any
other
man
in
Fedor
Ivanitch
s
position
would
have
hesitated
to
appear
in
society
Why
so
pray
interposed
Marfa
Timofyevna
What
nonsense
are
you
talking
The
man
s
come
back
to
his
home
where
would
you
have
him
go
And
has
he
been
to
blame
I
should
like
to
know
The
husband
is
always
to
blame
madam
I
venture
to
assure
you
when
a
wife
misconducts
herself
You
say
that
my
good
sir
because
you
have
never
been
married
yourself
Gedeonovsky
listened
with
a
forced
smile
If
I
may
be
so
inquisitive
he
asked
after
a
short
pause
for
whom
is
that
pretty
scarf
intended
Marfa
Timofyevna
gave
him
a
sharp
look
It
s
intended
she
replied
for
a
man
who
does
not
talk
scandal
nor
play
the
hypocrite
nor
tell
lies
if
there
s
such
a
man
to
be
found
in
the
world
I
know
Fedya
well
he
was
only
to
blame
in
being
too
good
to
his
wife
To
be
sure
he
married
for
love
and
no
good
ever
comes
of
those
love-matches
added
the
old
lady
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
Marya
Dmitrievna
as
she
got
up
from
her
place
And
now
my
good
sir
you
may
attack
any
one
you
like
even
me
if
you
choose
I
m
going
I
will
not
hinder
you
And
Marfa
Timofyevna
walked
away
That
s
always
how
she
is
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
following
her
aunt
with
her
eyes
We
must
remember
your
aunt
s
age
there
s
no
help
for
it
replied
Gedeonovsky
She
spoke
of
a
man
not
playing
the
hypocrite
But
who
is
not
hypocritical
nowadays
It
s
the
age
we
live
in
One
of
my
friends
a
most
worthy
man
and
I
assure
you
a
man
of
no
mean
position
used
to
say
that
nowadays
the
very
hens
can
t
pick
up
a
grain
of
corn
without
hypocrisy
they
always
approach
it
from
one
side
But
when
I
look
at
you
dear
lady
your
character
is
so
truly
angelic
let
me
kiss
your
little
snow-white
hand
Marya
Dmitrievna
with
a
faint
smile
held
out
her
plump
hand
to
him
with
the
little
finger
held
apart
from
the
rest
He
pressed
his
lips
to
it
and
she
drew
her
chair
nearer
to
him
and
bending
a
little
towards
him
asked
in
an
undertone
So
you
saw
him
Was
he
really
all
right
quite
well
and
cheerful
Yes
he
was
well
and
cheerful
replied
Gedeonovsky
in
a
whisper
You
haven
t
heard
where
his
wife
is
now
She
was
lately
in
Paris
now
they
say
she
has
gone
away
to
Italy
It
is
terrible
indeed
Fedya
s
position
I
wonder
how
he
can
bear
it
Every
one
of
course
has
trouble
but
he
one
may
say
has
been
made
the
talk
of
all
Europe
Gedeonovsky
sighed
Yes
indeed
yes
indeed
They
do
say
you
know
that
she
associates
with
artists
and
musicians
and
as
the
saying
is
with
strange
creatures
of
all
kinds
She
has
lost
all
sense
of
shame
completely
I
am
deeply
deeply
grieved
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
On
account
of
our
relationship
You
know
Sergei
Petrovitch
he
s
my
cousin
many
times
removed
Of
course
of
course
Don
t
I
know
everything
that
concerns
your
family
I
should
hope
so
indeed
Will
he
come
to
see
us
what
do
you
think
One
would
suppose
so
though
they
say
he
is
intending
to
go
home
to
his
country
place
Mary
Dmitrievna
lifted
her
eyes
to
heaven
Ah
Sergei
Petrovitch
Sergei
Petrovitch
when
I
think
how
careful
we
women
ought
to
be
in
our
conduct
There
are
women
and
women
Marya
Dmitrievna
There
are
unhappily
such
of
flighty
character
and
at
a
certain
age
too
and
then
they
are
not
brought
up
in
good
principles
Sergei
Petrovitch
drew
a
blue
checked
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
and
began
to
unfold
it
There
are
such
women
no
doubt
Sergei
Petrovitch
applied
a
corner
of
the
handkerchief
first
to
one
and
then
to
the
other
eye
But
speaking
generally
if
one
takes
into
consideration
I
mean
the
dust
in
the
town
is
really
extraordinary
to-day
he
wound
up
Maman
maman
cried
a
pretty
little
girl
of
eleven
running
into
the
room
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
is
coming
on
horseback
Marya
Dmitrievna
got
up
Sergei
Petrovitch
also
rose
and
made
a
bow
Our
humble
respects
to
Elena
Mihalovna
he
said
and
turning
aside
into
a
corner
for
good
manners
he
began
blowing
his
long
straight
nose
What
a
splendid
horse
he
has
continued
the
little
girl
He
was
at
the
gate
just
now
he
told
Lisa
and
me
he
would
dismount
at
the
steps
The
sound
of
hoofs
was
heard
and
a
graceful
young
man
riding
a
beautiful
bay
horse
was
seen
in
the
street
and
stopped
at
the
open
window
How
do
you
do
Marya
Dmitrievna
cried
the
young
