Katia
seated
herself
beside
Madame
and
fell
to
arranging
her
flowers
while
the
greyhound
whose
name
was
Fifi
approached
each
of
the
guests
in
turn
laid
his
cold
nose
in
their
hands
and
wagged
his
tail
Have
you
gathered
those
flowers
yourself
asked
Madame
Odintsov
Yes
Anna
Sergievna
the
girl
replied
And
is
your
aunt
going
to
join
us
at
tea
Yes
These
replies
of
Katia
's
were
accompanied
with
a
frank
but
gentle
and
bashful
smile
and
an
upward
glance
half
grave
half
sportive
Everything
in
her
betokened
youth
and
freshness
her
voice
the
down
on
her
cheeks
her
little
pink
hands
with
their
white
dimpled
palms
and
the
slightly
contracted
shoulders
Also
she
blushed
without
ceasing
and
drew
her
breath
with
a
fluttering
respiration
Presently
Madame
Odintsov
turned
to
Bazarov
Surely
it
is
only
out
of
politeness
that
you
are
looking
at
those
photographs
she
said
They
can
not
possibly
interest
you
Pray
move
nearer
to
us
and
let
us
engage
in
an
argument
Bazarov
approached
her
What
shall
we
argue
about
he
inquired
About
anything
you
like
But
first
let
me
warn
you
that
I
am
a
redoubtable
opponent
You
Yes
certainly
You
look
surprised
Why
so
Because
so
far
as
I
can
tell
your
temperament
is
one
of
the
cold
and
lethargic
order
whereas
argument
needs
impulsiveness
How
have
you
contrived
so
quickly
to
appraise
me
To
begin
with
I
am
both
impatient
and
exacting
Ask
Katia
if
I
am
not
Also
I
am
easily
moved
to
impulse
Bazarov
darted
a
glance
at
her
Possibly
he
said
Certainly
you
ought
to
know
best
But
since
you
desire
to
argue
let
us
argue
While
looking
at
those
views
of
Saxon
Switzerland
I
heard
you
remark
that
they
could
not
interest
me
This
you
said
I
presume
because
you
suppose
me
to
be
lacking
in
the
artistic
sense
Well
I
am
so
But
might
not
those
pictures
be
interesting
to
me
solely
from
the
geological
point
of
view
from
the
standpoint
of
an
observer
say
of
the
formation
of
mountains
Pardon
me
but
as
a
geologist
you
would
prefer
to
resort
to
some
special
work
on
that
science
not
to
a
few
pictures
Oh
not
necessarily
For
a
picture
may
instantly
present
what
a
book
could
set
forth
only
in
a
hundred
pages
Anna
Sergievna
made
no
reply
Well
she
resumed
leaning
forward
upon
the
table
a
movement
which
brought
her
face
closer
to
Bazarov
's
since
you
possess
not
a
grain
of
the
artistic
instinct
how
do
you
contrive
to
get
on
without
it
Rather
I
would
ask
you
What
is
the
artistic
instinct
able
to
effect
It
is
able
at
least
to
help
one
to
examine
and
to
instruct
one's
fellow
man
Bazarov
smiled
In
the
first
place
he
retorted
the
prime
requisite
in
that
connection
is
experience
of
life
and
in
the
second
place
the
study
of
detached
personalities
is
scarcely
worth
the
trouble
For
all
we
human
beings
are
alike
in
body
as
in
spirit
In
each
of
us
there
is
an
identical
brain
an
identical
spleen
an
identical
heart
an
identical
pair
of
lungs
an
identical
stock
of
the
so-called
moral
qualities
trifling
variations
between
which
we
need
not
take
into
account
Therefore
from
a
single
specimen
of
the
human
race
may
all
the
rest
be
judged
In
fact
human
beings
are
like
trees
in
a
forest
You
never
find
a
botanist
studying
its
individual
trunks
Katia
who
had
been
arranging
her
flowers
glanced
at
Bazarov
in
amazement
and
in
so
doing
encountered
his
keen
contemptuous
gaze
and
blushed
to
her
ears
Anna
Sergievna
shook
her
head
Trees
in
a
forest
she
exclaimed
Think
you
then
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
wise
man
and
the
fool
the
good
and
the
bad
No
I
do
not
replied
Bazarov
On
the
contrary
I
believe
that
such
differences
do
exist
The
point
is
that
they
exist
only
as
between
the
sound
and
the
ailing
For
instance
a
consumptive
's
lungs
are
not
as
yours
and
mine
yet
they
have
been
fashioned
precisely
as
our
own
have
been
Also
whereas
to
a
certain
extent
we
know
whence
bodily
disorders
arise
moral
disorders
come
of
faulty
education
the
thousand
and
one
follies
with
which
the
human
brain
is
afflicted
in
short
any
irregular
condition
of
the
social
body
Rectify
that
body
and
moral
sickness
will
soon
cease
to
be
Speaking
as
though
he
were
saying
to
himself
Believe
me
or
not
as
you
like
it
is
all
one
to
me
Bazarov
drew
his
long
fingers
through
his
whiskers
while
his
eyes
glowed
like
coals
Then
you
think
pursued
Anna
Sergievna
that
once
the
social
body
has
been
rectified
stupid
and
evil
people
will
cease
to
exist
At
all
events
once
the
social
body
is
properly
organised
the
fact
that
a
man
be
wise
or
stupid
good
or
bad
will
cease
to
be
of
importance
Ah
I
understand
That
is
because
we
all
possess
an
identical
spleen
Precisely
so
madam
She
turned
to
Arkady
And
what
is
your
opinion
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
she
enquired
I
agree
with
Evgenii
was
his
reply
as
in
his
turn
he
received
a
glance
of
astonishment
from
Katia
I
am
surprised
gentlemen
said
Madame
However
I
can
hear
my
aunt
approaching
so
let
us
spare
her
ears
and
discuss
this
later
Anna
Sergievna
's
aunt
a
small
spare
woman
with
a
mallet-shaped
face
a
pair
of
narrow
malicious
eyes
and
a
grey
false
front
bestowed
scarcely
so
much
as
a
bow
upon
the
guests
but
at
once
relapsed
into
a
huge
velvet
armchair
which
no
one
but
herself
was
allowed
to
use
And
even
when
Katia
hastened
to
place
for
her
a
footstool
the
old
woman
did
not
thank
her
nor
even
look
at
her
but
chafed
her
hands
under
the
yellow
shawl
which
covered
the
whole
of
her
frail
figure
Beyond
all
things
was
she
fond
of
yellow
wherefore
she
had
had
her
cap
trimmed
with
ribands
of
the
same
hue
Have
you
slept
well
Auntie
Madame
Odintsov
inquired
with
a
raising
of
her
voice
That
dog
is
here
again
the
old
woman
muttered
on
noticing
that
Fifi
was
taking
an
irresolute
step
or
two
in
her
direction
Turn
the
beast
out
I
say
Out
with
it
Calling
Fifi
Katia
opened
the
door
for
the
animal
to
leave
the
room
whereupon
though
it
bounded
out
in
joyous
mood
under
the
impression
that
it
was
about
to
be
taken
for
a
walk
it
no
sooner
found
itself
marooned
outside
than
it
fell
to
whining
and
scratching
at
the
panels
which
caused
the
Princess
to
frown
and
necessitated
Katia
's
exit
to
rectify
matters
Tea
is
ready
I
believe
Madame
Odintsov
continued
Gentlemen
pray
come
Will
you
have
some
tea
Auntie
The
Princess
rose
from
her
chair
in
silence
and
headed
a
procession
to
the
dining-room
where
a
Cossack
footman
pulled
a
padded
armchair
from
under
the
table
like
the
last
it
was
reserved
for
the
Princess
alone
and
she
subsided
into
its
depths
Katia
poured
out
tea
and
handed
her
aunt
the
first
cup
a
cup
adorned
with
a
coat-of-arms
whereafter
the
old
woman
added
some
honey
to
the
beverage
she
looked
upon
tea-drinking
with
sugar
as
a
sin
of
extravagance
and
the
more
so
since
never
at
any
time
would
she
consent
to
spend
an
unnecessary
kopeck
and
then
asked
hoarsely
What
has
Prince
Ivan
to
say
in
his
letter
No
one
answered
and
in
time
Bazarov
and
Arkady
apprised
the
fact
that
though
treated
certainly
with
respect
the
old
woman
attracted
no
one
's
serious
attention
They
keep
her
here
for
show
Bazarov
reflected
She
is
kept
because
she
comes
of
a
princely
house
Tea
over
Anna
Sergievna
proposed
a
walk
but
since
at
that
moment
a
drop
of
rain
came
pattering
down
the
company
with
the
exception
of
the
Princess
returned
to
the
drawing-room
Presently
the
neighbour
addicted
to
a
game
of
cards
came
in
and
proved
to
be
one
Porphyri
Platonitch
a
stout
grey-headed
affable
diverting
individual
who
in
addition
could
boast
of
a
pair
of
legs
as
shapely
as
though
turned
with
a
lathe
Anna
Sergievna
then
inquired
of
Bazarov
with
whom
she
had
again
been
in
conversation
whether
he
would
care
to
join
them
in
the
old-fashioned
game
of
Preferences
and
he
consented
on
the
ground
that
he
could
not
too
soon
prepare
himself
for
the
post
of
a
district
physician
But
take
care
remarked
his
hostess
Porphyri
Platonitch
and
I
are
not
unlikely
to
beat
you
Meanwhile
do
you
Katia
go
and
play
something
on
the
piano
for
the
benefit
of
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
I
know
that
he
loves
music
and
we
too
shall
be
glad
to
listen
to
you
Reluctantly
Katia
approached
the
piano
nor
in
spite
of
Arkady's
fondness
for
music
did
he
follow
her
any
more
eagerly
The
truth
of
it
was
that
he
felt
himself
to
be
being
got
rid
of
by
Madame
Odintsov
and
already
there
was
simmering
in
his
heart
as
in
the
heart
of
any
young
man
of
his
age
that
vague
oppressive
feeling
which
is
the
harbinger
of
love
Raising
the
lid
of
the
piano
Katia
murmured
under
her
breath
and
without
looking
at
Arkady
What
shall
I
play
Anything
you
wish
he
replied
with
indifference
But
what
sort
of
music
do
you
prefer
she
persisted
with
unchanged
attitude
Classical
music
was
the
reply
delivered
with
equal
nonchalance
Mozart
Certainly
Mozart
So
Katia
produced
the
Viennese
master
's
Sonata-Fantasia
in
C
minor
She
played
it
well
but
coldly
and
not
with
any
excess
of
precision
Likewise
she
kept
her
lips
compressed
her
eyes
upon
the
keys
and
her
form
erect
and
motionless
Only
towards
the
close
of
the
piece
did
her
face
kindle
at
all
while
at
the
same
moment
a
tiny
curl
detached
itself
from
her
loosely-bound
hair
and
fell
over
her
dusky
forehead
Arkady
also
felt
moved
by
the
closing
portion
of
the
Sonata
the
portion
where
the
charming
careless
gaiety
of
the
melody
gives
place
to
sudden
bursts
of
mournful
almost
tragic
lamentation
Yet
the
thoughts
which
Mozart
's
strains
aroused
in
him
bore
no
relation
to
Katia
He
merely
looked
at
her
now
and
then
and
reflected
She
plays
well
nor
is
she
bad-looking
The
Sonata
over
Katia
inquired
without
removing
her
hands
from
the
keyboard
Is
that
enough
and
Arkady
replied
that
he
would
not
think
of
troubling
her
further
Then
he
went
on
to
talk
of
Mozart
and
to
ask
her
whether
she
herself
had
selected
the
Sonata
or
whether
it
had
been
selected
for
her
by
some
one
Katia
answered
in
monosyllables
and
from
time
to
time
went
into
hiding
retired
into
herself
and
on
each
occasion
of
this
sort
she
made
her
reappearance
but
reluctantly
and
with
a
face
composed
to
a
stubborn
almost
a
stupid
air
Yet
she
was
not
timid
so
much
as
diffident
and
a
trifle
overawed
by
the
presence
of
the
sister
who
had
brought
her
up
not
that
the
sister
in
question
ever
suspected
it
Finally
she
returned
to
her
flowers
and
Arkady
found
himself
reduced
to
calling
Fifi
to
his
side
and
stroking
the
dog's
head
with
a
kindly
smile
As
for
Bazarov
he
had
to
pay
forfeit
after
forfeit
for
Anna
Sergievna
was
fairly
clever
at
cards
and
Porphyri
Platonitch
was
a
player
fully
able
to
look
after
himself
Consequently
the
young
doctor
rose
a
loser
not
by
a
considerable
sum
but
by
one
which
at
all
events
was
sufficient
to
be
scarcely
agreeable
After
supper
Anna
Sergievna
started
a
discussion
on
botany
I
wish
you
would
take
me
for
a
walk
to-morrow
morning
she
said
I
want
you
to
teach
me
the
Latin
names
of
our
field
flowers
and
also
their
characteristics
But
how
could
the
Latin
names
benefit
you
he
inquired
System
is
in
all
things
necessary
she
replied
A
truly
wonderful
woman
Arkady
commented
the
same
evening
on
finding
himself
alone
with
his
friend
in
the
bedroom
Yes
replied
Bazarov
She
certainly
possesses
brains
Also
she
has
dreamed
dreams
In
what
sense
In
the
best
sense
my
friend
in
the
very
best
sense
O
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
Certain
also
am
I
that
she
manages
her
property
well
But
the
marvellous
phenomenon
is
not
she
but
her
sister
What
That
hoyden
Yes
that
hoyden
The
hoyden
contains
an
element
of
freshness
and
virginity
and
timidity
and
reticence
and
anything
else
you
like
which
makes
her
really
an
object
worthy
of
interest
Of
the
one
you
could
make
whatsoever
you
might
desire
whereas
of
the
other
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
save
that
she
represents
a
yesterday
's
loaf
Arkady
made
no
reply
and
soon
the
two
men
were
asleep
and
dreaming
their
own
dreams
The
same
night
Anna
Sergievna
devoted
much
thought
to
her
two
guests
Bazarov
she
liked
both
for
his
total
lack
of
affectation
and
for
the
piquancy
of
his
criticisms
so
that
she
seemed
to
divine
in
him
something
new
something
which
had
hitherto
remained
unknown
to
her
experience
All
of
which
excited
her
curiosity
And
she
too
was
a
strange
being
Free
from
all
prejudice
and
devoid
of
all
strong
beliefs
she
rendered
obeisance
to
nothing
and
had
in
view
no
goal
Again
though
much
was
open
to
her
sight
and
much
interested
her
nothing
really
satisfied
her
and
she
had
no
wish
for
such
satisfaction
since
her
intellect
was
at
once
inquiring
and
indifferent
and
harboured
doubts
which
never
merged
into
insensibility
and
aspirations
which
never
swelled
into
unrest
True
if
she
had
been
dowered
with
less
wealth
and
independence
she
might
have
plunged
into
the
fray
and
learnt
the
nature
of
passion
but
as
things
stood
she
took
life
unhastingly
and
though
often
finding
it
tedious
spent
her
days
in
a
deliberate
rarely
agitated
manner
True
at
times
rainbow
colours
gleamed
even
before
her
eyes
yet
no
sooner
had
they
faded
than
she
would
draw
her
breath
as
before
and
in
no
way
regret
their
disappearance
Again
though
at
times
her
imagination
exceeded
the
bounds
of
what
is
considered
permissible
by
conventional
morality
her
blood
still
coursed
tranquilly
through
her
lethargic
and
bewitchingly
shaped
frame
and
only
when
she
was
issuing
in
a
warm
and
tender
glow
from
her
comfortable
bathroom
would
she
fall
to
pondering
upon
the
futility
of
life
its
sorrow
and
toil
and
cruelty
and
feel
her
soul
swell
to
sudden
temerity
and
begin
to
seethe
with
noble
aspirations
Yet
even
then
let
but
a
draught
happen
to
blow
in
her
direction
from
an
open
window
and
at
once
she
would
shrug
her
shoulders
commiserate
herself
come
very
near
to
losing
her
temper
and
become
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
thought
that
the
one
thing
necessary
was
to
ensure
that
by
hook
or
by
crook
that
abominable
draught
should
be
averted
Again
like
all
women
who
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
fall
in
love
she
was
sensible
of
a
persistent
yearning
for
something
wholly
undefined
There
was
nothing
that
she
actually
lacked
yet
she
seemed
to
lack
everything
The
late
Odintsov
she
had
merely
tolerated
the
marriage
having
been
one
de
convenance
only
though
she
would
never
have
consented
to
become
his
wife
had
he
not
also
been
kindly
of
heart
and
from
the
experience
she
had
derived
a
certain
aversion
to
the
male
sex
in
general
which
she
conceived
to
be
composed
exclusively
of
creatures
slovenly
idle
wearisome
and
weakly
exacting
in
their
habits
In
fact
only
once
had
she
met
it
was
somewhere
abroad
a
man
who
had
in
any
way
attracted
her
He
had
been
a
young
Swede
of
a
knightly
countenance
honest
blue
eyes
and
an
open
brow
but
for
all
the
impression
that
he
had
made
upon
her
the
impression
in
question
had
not
prevented
her
from
shortly
afterwards
returning
to
Russia
A
strange
man
that
Bazarov
she
thought
to
herself
as
she
reposed
in
her
magnificent
bed
with
its
lace-embroidered
pillows
and
its
light
silken
coverlet
It
may
be
said
that
in
addition
to
having
inherited
her
late
father
's
fastidious
and
luxurious
tastes
she
still
cherished
for
that
wayward
but
kindhearted
parent
a
considerable
affection
since
during
his
lifetime
he
had
not
only
adored
her
and
cracked
jokes
with
her
on
equal
terms
but
also
accorded
her
his
whole
confidence
and
made
it
his
invariable
custom
to
seek
her
advice
Of
her
mother
she
had
but
the
scantiest
of
remembrance
Yes
a
strange
man
is
that
Bazarov
she
repeated
after
which
she
stretched
her
limbs
smiled
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
head
ran
an
eye
over
the
pages
of
two
foolish
French
novels
let
fall
the
second
of
these
volumes
from
her
hands
and
relapsed
into
slumber
a
cold
spotless
figure
in
spotless
fragrant
white
When
breakfast
was
over
next
morning
she
set
forth
upon
the
botanising
expedition
with
Bazarov
to
return
home
just
before
luncheon
time
Meanwhile
Arkady
did
not
leave
the
house
but
spent
an
hour
with
Katia
nor
found
the
time
wearisome
seeing
that
of
her
own
accord
Katia
volunteered
to
repeat
the
Sonata
Yet
the
instant
that
his
eyes
beheld
Madame
Odintsov
returning
his
heart
leapt
within
him
She
was
crossing
the
garden
with
a
slightly
tired
step
but
with
her
cheeks
rosy
of
hue
her
eyes
shining
under
her
round
straw
hat
with
even
greater
brilliancy
than
usual
and
her
fingers
twirling
between
them
the
stalk
of
some
field
flower
Also
her
light
mantilla
had
slipped
to
her
shoulders
and
the
broad
ribands
of
her
hat
were
floating
over
her
bosom
Behind
her
walked
Bazarov
with
his
usual
air
of
superciliousness
and
self-assurance
while
on
his
face
there
was
an
expression
cheerful
and
even
good-humoured
Yet
somehow
Arkady
did
not
like
that
expression
Muttering
Good-morning
Bazarov
passed
towards
his
room
while
Madame
Odintsov
accorded
the
young
man
a
negligent
handshake
then
similarly
continued
her
way
'Good
morning
thought
Arkady
to
himself
One
would
think
that
she
and
I
had
made
one
another
's
acquaintance
only
to-day

Robert
Wilhelm
Bunsen
1811-1899
chemist
and
physicist
inventor
of
Bunsen
's
burner
and
magnesium
light
and
originator
with
Kirchhov
of
spectrum
analysis
As
we
know
time
either
flies
like
a
bird
or
crawls
like
a
snail
Thus
a
man
is
in
best
case
when
he
fails
to
notice
either
the
rapidity
or
the
slowness
of
its
flight
Similarly
did
Bazarov
and
Arkady
spend
their
fortnight
at
Madame
Odintsov
's
Of
this
another
contributory
cause
was
the
fact
that
alike
in
her
household
and
in
her
daily
life
she
maintained
a
régime
to
which
she
herself
strictly
adhered
and
to
which
she
constrained
others
to
adhere
so
that
the
daily
domestic
round
accomplished
itself
according
to
a
fixed
programme
At
eight
o'clock
the
company
would
assemble
for
breakfast
whereafter
until
luncheon
time
individuals
could
do
whatsoever
they
chose
the
hostess
herself
devoting
her
attention
to
her
steward
she
administered
her
estate
on
the
obrok
or
tithes
system
her
household
servants
and
her
head
housekeeper
Next
before
dinner
the
company
would
reassemble
for
conversation
or
for
reading
aloud
and
the
rest
of
the
evening
would
be
devoted
to
a
walk
to
cards
or
to
music
Lastly
at
half-past
ten
Anna
Sergievna
would
withdraw
to
her
room
issue
her
orders
for
the
following
day
and
retire
to
bed
But
to
Bazarov
this
measured
slightly
formal
regularity
was
not
wholly
agreeable
Somehow
it
reminds
one
of
running
on
a
pair
of
rails
he
used
to
declare
while
so
much
did
the
sight
of
liveried
lacqueys
and
graded
serfs
offend
his
democratic
instincts
that
once
he
averred
that
one
might
as
well
dine
in
the
English
fashion
outright
and
wear
white
ties
and
black
tail-coats
These
views
he
expressed
to
Anna
Sergievna
something
in
her
always
led
men
to
lay
bare
their
opinions
in
her
presence
and
after
she
had
heard
him
out
she
said
From
your
point
of
view
the
matter
is
as
you
say
and
perhaps
I
play
the
fine
lady
too
much
but
in
the
country
one
can
not
live
anyhow
such
a
course
always
leads
one
to
grow
slovenly
So
she
continued
her
régime
as
before
Yet
though
Bazarov
grumbled
he
and
Arkady
found
that
to
that
very
formality
they
owed
the
fact
that
everything
in
the
establishment
ran
as
on
rails
In
passing
it
may
be
mentioned
that
between
the
two
young
men
there
had
taken
place
a
change
which
dated
from
the
day
of
their
arrival
at
Nikolsköe
and
manifested
itself
as
regards
Bazarov
for
whom
Anna
Sergievna
evidently
entertained
a
liking
though
seldom
did
she
agree
with
his
dicta
in
the
form
of
an
unwonted
captiousness
which
led
him
easily
to
lose
his
temper
to
speak
always
with
reluctance
to
glare
about
him
and
to
be
as
unable
to
sit
still
as
though
mines
had
been
exploding
beneath
his
seat
As
for
Arkady
now
come
finally
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
in
love
with
Madame
Odintsov
the
change
manifested
itself
rather
in
his
falling
a
prey
to
a
melancholy
which
in
no
way
prevented
him
from
making
friends
with
Katia
and
even
helped
him
to
maintain
with
her
kindly
and
cordial
relations
Whereas
Madame
cares
nothing
for
me
he
would
reflect
this
good-hearted
creature
does
not
give
me
the
cold
shoulder
And
these
reflections
would
cause
his
heart
to
taste
once
more
the
sensuous
joy
of
magnanimity
Dimly
Katia
herself
divined
that
her
society
afforded
him
a
sort
of
comfort
wherefore
she
saw
no
reason
to
deny
either
him
or
herself
the
pleasure
of
this
innocent
half-diffident
half-trustful
camaraderie
True
in
the
presence
and
under
the
keen
eye
of
the
elder
sister
who
always
caused
Katia
to
retire
precipitately
into
her
shell
the
pair
never
exchanged
a
single
word
indeed
as
a
man
in
love
Arkady
could
not
well
have
paid
attention
to
any
one
but
the
object
of
his
adoration
while
in
the
latter
's
vicinity
but
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
alone
with
Katia
he
began
to
a
certain
degree
really
to
enjoy
himself
That
is
to
say
whereas
he
knew
himself
to
be
incompetent
to
interest
Madame
seeing
that
whenever
he
found
himself
alone
with
her
he
blushed
and
lost
his
head
while
she
on
her
side
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
so
jejune
was
his
mind
as
compared
with
her
own
in
Katia
's
presence
he
felt
perfectly
at
home
and
could
treat
her
with
condescension
and
let
her
expound
to
him
the
impressions
which
she
derived
from
music
and
the
reading
of
tales
poems
and
other
trifles
Nor
did
he
notice
nor
would
he
have
consented
to
recognise
had
he
noticed
the
fact
that
those
same
trifles
interested
him
as
much
as
they
did
Katia
At
the
same
time
the
latter
in
no
way
acted
as
a
clog
upon
his
melancholy
wherefore
just
as
Madame
was
at
her
ease
with
Bazarov
so
the
young
man
was
at
his
with
Katia
and
after
a
short
period
of
joint
converse
the
two
couples
would
usually
diverge
This
happened
especially
during
walks
and
the
more
readily
in
that
whereas
Katia
adored
nature
and
Arkady
too
loved
it
though
he
would
never
have
admitted
the
fact
to
Madame
and
Bazarov
the
charms
of
the
natural
world
represented
more
or
less
a
matter
of
indifference
Hardly
need
I
add
that
from
this
constant
separation
between
Arkady
and
Bazarov
there
flowed
inevitable
results
which
brought
about
in
the
relations
of
the
pair
a
gradual
change
That
is
to
say
Bazarov
ceased
to
discourse
on
Madame
Odintsov
he
ceased
even
to
censure
her
for
her
aristocratic
manners
and
while
with
regard
to
Katia
he
sang
her
praises
as
usual
at
the
same
time
advising
the
placing
of
a
check
upon
her
sentimental
tendencies
he
took
to
uttering
these
encomiums
only
in
a
half-hearted
and
a
perfunctory
way
and
in
general
to
lecturing
his
pupil
less
than
he
had
formerly
done
Rather
he
seemed
to
avoid
him
to
feel
in
some
way
uncomfortable
in
his
presence
These
things
Arkady
duly
noted
but
kept
his
observations
to
himself
The
real
cause
of
the
innovation
was
the
feeling
which
Madame
Odintsov
inspired
in
Bazarov
's
breast
and
which
he
found
to
be
a
torture
and
a
madness
to
him
Yet
had
any
one
hinted
to
him
ever
so
distantly
that
what
was
taking
place
in
his
soul
could
ever
have
been
possible
he
would
have
denied
it
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
and
a
cynical
imprecation
seeing
that
though
a
great
devotee
of
feminine
society
and
feminine
beauty
he
looked
upon
love
in
the
ideal
the
romantic
to
use
his
own
term
aspect
as
unpardonable
folly
and
upon
the
sentiment
of
chivalry
as
a
sort
of
aberration
or
malady
which
moved
him
frequently
to
express
his
astonishment
that
Toggenburg
and
his
Minnesingers
and
troubadours
never
ended
by
being
clapped
in
a
madhouse
Should
a
woman
please
you
he
would
say
strive
to
attain
your
goal
but
if
you
can
not
attain
that
goal
waste
no
further
trouble
just
turn
away
For
the
world
does
not
rest
upon
a
single
keystone
In
similar
fashion
Madame
Odintsov
pleased
Bazarov
yet
though
the
widespread
reports
in
circulation
about
her
might
with
the
freedom
and
independence
of
her
views
and
the
undoubted
penchant
which
she
entertained
for
himself
have
been
reckoned
to
tell
in
his
favour
he
soon
discovered
that
in
her
case
the
goal
was
not
to
be
attained
Also
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
he
could
not
turn
away
rather
that
the
mere
thought
of
her
made
his
blood
boil
True
that
symptom
if
it
had
been
the
only
one
might
have
been
dealt
with
but
there
became
implanted
in
him
something
else
something
which
he
had
hitherto
refused
to
admit
something
of
which
he
had
hitherto
made
sport
but
something
which
now
aroused
his
pride
Therefore
although
when
conversing
with
Anna
Sergievna
he
poured
added
scorn
upon
everything
romantic
he
recognised
during
his
hours
of
solitude
that
even
in
his
own
personality
there
lurked
an
element
of
Romanticism
And
at
such
times
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
rush
out
of
doors
into
the
woods
and
to
stride
along
at
a
pace
which
snapped
off
chance-met
boughs
and
found
vent
in
curses
at
both
them
and
himself
Or
he
would
seek
a
hayloft
or
stable
and
stubbornly
closing
his
eyes
strive
to
woo
sleep
and
almost
invariably
fail
Yet
as
he
sat
there
there
would
come
to
him
delusions
that
those
proud
lips
had
once
responded
to
his
kisses
that
those
chaste
arms
had
embraced
his
neck
that
those
soulful
eyes
had
gazed
tenderly
yes
tenderly
into
his
and
at
such
times
his
head
would
whirl
and
for
a
second
or
two
and
until
his
discontent
returned
he
would
relapse
into
a
state
of
trance
and
as
though
urged
by
a
demon
think
thoughts
of
unavowable
import
Again
there
were
times
when
he
would
conceive
a
change
similar
to
his
own
to
have
taken
place
in
her
and
the
expression
of
her
face
already
to
be
charged
with
a
special
significance
Yet
this
point
reached
he
would
end
merely
by
stamping
his
feet
grinding
his
teeth
and
mentally
shaking
his
fist
at
himself
Once
when
walking
with
her
in
the
garden
he
announced
to
her
in
curt
gruff
tones
that
he
intended
soon
to
depart
for
his
father
's
place
whereupon
Anna
Sergievna
turned
pale
as
though
something
had
pricked
her
heart
and
pricked
it
in
such
a
manner
as
to
surprise
even
herself
and
to
leave
her
wondering
what
it
could
portend
Yet
not
for
the
sake
of
testing
her
nor
of
seeing
what
might
possibly
come
of
it
had
he
mentioned
his
purposed
departure
never
at
any
time
did
he
indulge
in
scheming
Rather
the
reason
was
that
earlier
that
morning
he
had
had
an
interview
with
his
father
's
steward
Timotheitch
a
rough
but
quick-witted
old
fellow
who
in
past
days
had
acted
as
his
nurse
and
had
now
presented
himself
with
tousled
flaxen
hair
red
weather-beaten
face
watery
sunken
eyes
short
stout
jacket
of
grey-blue
cloth
leathern
girdle
and
tarred
boots
at
Nikolsköe
Good-day
to
you
ancient
had
been
Bazarov
's
greeting
Good-day
to
you
batiushka
had
responded
the
old
man
with
a
gleeful
smile
which
had
covered
his
face
with
wrinkles
And
how
is
it
that
I
see
you
here
Bazarov
had
continued
Is
it
that
they
have
sent
you
to
fetch
me
By
no
means
pardon
me
batiushka
Timotheitch
had
stammered
out
this
denial
for
the
reason
that
he
had
suddenly
recollected
certain
strict
injunctions
imposed
upon
him
before
starting
No
it
is
merely
that
I
am
on
my
way
to
the
town
on
affairs
connected
with
the
estate
and
turned
aside
a
little
to
pay
my
respects
to
your
honour
No
not
to
disturb
you
at
all
oh
dear
no
Do
not
lie
Bazarov
had
said
Is
this
the
way
to
the
town
Timotheitch
cringing
had
returned
no
reply
And
how
is
my
father
Bazarov
had
continued
Quite
well
thank
God
And
my
mother
Your
mother
is
the
same
thank
God
And
they
are
I
suppose
expecting
me
The
old
man
had
cocked
his
head
with
a
knowing
air
Evgenii
Vasilitch
why
should
they
not
be
expecting
you
Yes
as
God
is
my
trust
I
know
that
their
hearts
are
simply
aching
for
a
sight
of
you
Well
well
Do
not
make
too
long
a
stay
of
it
but
tell
them
that
I
will
come
presently
I
will
batiushka
Yet
it
had
been
with
a
sigh
that
Timotheitch
had
replaced
his
cap
on
his
head
with
both
hands
left
the
house
remounted
the
shabby
drozhki
which
he
had
left
waiting
at
the
gates
and
disappeared
at
a
trot
though
not
in
the
direction
of
the
town
The
same
evening
saw
Madame
sitting
in
her
boudoir
with
Bazarov
and
Arkady
pacing
the
salon
and
listening
to
Katia
's
music
As
for
the
Princess
she
had
gone
to
bed
for
she
could
not
abide
the
