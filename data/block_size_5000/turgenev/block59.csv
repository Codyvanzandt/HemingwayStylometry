old-fashioned
but
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
even
to
hint
at
this
to
her
husband
If
she
had
proposed
to
establish
herself
at
Lavriky
she
would
have
changed
everything
in
it
beginning
of
course
with
the
house
but
the
idea
of
staying
in
that
out-of-the-way
corner
of
the
steppes
never
entered
her
head
for
an
instant
she
lived
as
in
a
tent
good-temperedly
putting
up
with
all
its
inconveniences
and
indulgently
making
merry
over
then
Marfa
Timofyevna
came
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
former
charge
Varvara
Pavlovna
liked
her
very
much
but
she
did
not
like
Varvara
Pavlovna
The
new
mistress
did
not
get
on
with
Glafira
Petrovna
either
she
would
have
left
her
in
peace
but
old
Korobyin
wanted
to
have
a
hand
in
the
management
of
his
son-in-law
s
affairs
to
superintend
the
property
of
such
a
near
relative
he
said
was
not
beneath
the
dignity
of
even
a
general
One
must
add
that
Pavel
Petrovitch
would
not
have
been
above
managing
the
property
even
of
a
total
stranger
Varvara
Pavlovna
conducted
her
attack
very
skillfully
without
taking
any
step
in
advance
apparently
completely
absorbed
in
the
bliss
of
the
honeymoon
in
the
peaceful
life
of
the
country
in
music
and
reading
she
gradually
worked
Glafira
up
to
such
a
point
that
she
rushed
one
morning
like
one
possessed
into
Lavretsky
s
study
and
throwing
a
bunch
of
keys
on
the
table
she
declared
that
she
was
not
equal
to
undertaking
the
management
any
longer
and
did
not
want
to
stop
in
the
place
Lavretsky
having
been
suitably
prepared
beforehand
at
once
agreed
to
her
departure
This
Glafira
Petrovna
had
not
anticipated
Very
well
she
said
and
her
face
darkened
I
see
that
I
am
not
wanted
here
I
know
who
is
driving
me
out
of
the
home
of
my
fathers
Only
you
mark
my
words
nephew
you
will
never
make
a
home
anywhere
you
will
come
to
be
a
wanderer
for
ever
That
is
my
last
word
to
you
The
same
day
she
went
away
to
her
own
little
property
and
in
a
week
General
Korobyin
was
there
and
with
a
pleasant
melancholy
in
his
looks
and
movements
he
took
the
superintendence
of
the
whole
property
into
his
hands
In
the
month
of
September
Varvara
Pavlovna
carried
her
husband
off
to
Petersburg
She
passed
two
winters
in
Petersburg
for
the
summer
she
went
to
stay
at
Tsarskoe
Selo
in
a
splendid
light
artistically-furnished
flat
they
made
many
acquaintances
among
the
middle
and
even
higher
ranks
of
society
went
out
and
entertained
a
great
deal
and
gave
the
most
charming
dances
and
musical
evenings
Varvara
Pavlovna
attracted
guests
as
a
fire
attracts
moths
Fedor
Ivanitch
did
not
altogether
like
such
a
frivolous
life
His
wife
advised
him
to
take
some
office
under
government
but
from
old
association
with
his
father
and
also
through
his
own
ideas
he
was
unwilling
to
enter
government
service
still
he
remained
in
Petersburg
for
Varvara
Pavlovna
s
pleasure
He
soon
discovered
however
that
no
one
hindered
him
from
being
alone
that
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
he
had
the
quietest
and
most
comfortable
study
in
all
Petersburg
that
his
tender
wife
was
even
ready
to
aid
him
to
be
alone
and
from
that
time
forth
all
went
well
He
again
applied
himself
to
his
own
as
he
considered
unfinished
education
he
began
again
to
read
and
even
began
to
learn
English
It
was
a
strange
sight
to
see
his
powerful
broad-shouldered
figure
for
ever
bent
over
his
writing
table
his
full-bearded
ruddy
face
half
buried
in
the
pages
of
a
dictionary
or
note-book
Every
morning
he
set
to
work
then
had
a
capital
dinner
Varvara
Pavlovna
was
unrivaled
as
a
housekeeper
and
in
the
evenings
he
entered
an
enchanted
world
of
light
and
perfume
peopled
by
gay
young
faces
and
the
centre
of
this
world
was
also
the
careful
housekeeper
his
wife
She
rejoiced
his
heart
by
the
birth
of
a
son
but
the
poor
child
did
not
live
long
it
died
in
the
spring
and
in
the
summer
by
the
advice
of
the
doctors
Lavretsky
took
his
wife
abroad
to
a
watering-place
Distraction
was
essential
for
her
after
such
a
trouble
and
her
health
too
required
a
warm
climate
The
summer
and
autumn
they
spent
in
Germany
and
Switzerland
and
for
the
winter
as
one
would
naturally
expect
they
went
to
Paris
In
Paris
Varvara
Pavlovna
bloomed
like
a
rose
and
was
able
to
make
herself
a
little
nest
as
quickly
and
cleverly
as
in
Petersburg
She
found
very
pretty
apartments
in
one
of
the
quiet
but
fashionable
streets
in
Paris
she
embroidered
her
husband
such
a
dressing-gown
as
he
had
never
worn
before
engaged
a
coquettish
waiting
maid
an
excellent
cook
and
a
smart
footman
procured
a
fascinating
carriage
and
an
exquisite
piano
Before
a
week
had
passed
she
crossed
the
street
wore
her
shawl
opened
her
parasol
and
put
on
her
gloves
in
a
manner
equal
to
the
most
true-born
Parisian
And
she
soon
drew
round
herself
acquaintances
At
first
only
Russians
visited
her
afterwards
Frenchmen
too
very
agreeable
polite
and
unmarried
with
excellent
manners
and
well-sounding
names
they
all
talked
a
great
deal
and
very
fast
bowed
easily
grimaced
agreeably
their
white
teeth
flashed
under
their
rosy
lips
and
how
they
could
smile
All
of
them
brought
their
friends
and
la
belle
Madame
de
Lavretsky
was
soon
known
from
Chausee
d
Antin
to
Rue
de
Lille
In
those
days
it
was
in
1836
there
had
not
yet
arisen
the
tribe
of
journalists
and
reporters
who
now
swarm
on
all
sides
like
ants
in
an
ant-hill
but
even
then
there
was
seen
in
Varvara
Pavlovna
s
salon
a
certain
M
Jules
a
gentleman
of
unprepossessing
exterior
with
a
scandalous
reputation
insolent
and
mean
like
all
duelists
and
men
who
have
been
beaten
Varvara
Pavlovna
felt
a
great
aversion
to
this
M
Jules
but
she
received
him
because
he
wrote
for
various
journals
and
was
incessantly
mentioning
her
calling
her
at
one
time
Madame
de
L
tski
at
another
Madame
de
cette
grande
dame
russe
si
distinguee
qui
demeure
rue
de
P
and
telling
all
the
world
that
is
some
hundreds
of
readers
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
Madame
de
L
tski
how
charming
and
delightful
this
lady
was
a
true
Frenchwoman
in
intelligence
une
vraie
francaise
par
l
esprit
Frenchmen
have
no
higher
praise
than
this
what
an
extraordinary
musician
she
was
and
how
marvelously
she
waltzed
Varvara
Pavlovna
did
in
fact
waltz
so
that
she
drew
all
her
hearts
to
the
hem
of
her
light
flying
skirts
in
a
word
he
spread
her
fame
through
the
world
and
whatever
one
may
say
that
is
pleasant
Mademoiselle
Mars
had
already
left
the
stage
and
Mademoiselle
Rachel
had
not
yet
made
her
appearance
nevertheless
Varvara
Pavlovna
was
assiduous
in
visiting
the
theatres
She
went
into
raptures
over
Italian
music
yawned
decorously
at
the
Comedie
Francaise
and
wept
at
the
acting
of
Madame
Dorval
in
some
ultra
romantic
melodrama
and
a
great
thing
Liszt
played
twice
in
her
salon
and
was
so
kind
so
simple
it
was
charming
In
such
agreeable
sensations
was
spent
the
winter
at
the
end
of
which
Varvara
Pavlovna
was
even
presented
at
court
Fedor
Ivanitch
for
his
part
was
not
bored
though
his
life
at
times
weighed
rather
heavily
on
him
because
it
was
empty
He
read
the
papers
listened
to
the
lectures
at
the
Sorbonne
and
the
College
de
France
followed
the
debates
in
the
Chambers
and
set
to
work
on
a
translation
of
a
well-known
scientific
treatise
on
irrigation
I
am
not
wasting
my
time
he
thought
it
is
all
of
use
but
next
winter
I
must
without
fail
return
to
Russia
and
set
to
work
It
is
difficult
to
say
whether
he
had
any
clear
idea
of
precisely
what
this
work
would
consist
of
and
there
is
no
telling
whether
he
would
have
succeeded
in
going
to
Russia
in
the
winter
in
the
meantime
he
was
going
with
his
wife
to
Baden
An
unexpected
incident
broke
up
all
his
plans
Happening
to
go
one
day
in
Varvara
Pavlovna
s
absence
into
her
boudoir
Lavretsky
saw
on
the
floor
a
carefully
folded
little
paper
He
mechanically
picked
it
up
unfolded
it
and
read
the
following
note
written
in
French
Sweet
angel
Betsy
I
never
can
make
up
my
mind
to
call
you
Barbe
or
Varvara
I
waited
in
vain
for
you
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
come
to
our
little
room
at
half-past
one
to-morrow
Your
stout
good-natured
husband
ton
gros
bonhomme
de
mari
is
usually
buried
in
his
books
at
that
time
we
will
sing
once
more
the
song
of
your
poet
Pouskine
de
botre
poete
Pouskine
that
you
taught
me
Old
husband
cruel
husband
A
thousand
kisses
on
your
little
hands
and
feet
I
await
you
Ernest
Lavretsky
did
not
at
once
understand
what
he
had
read
he
read
it
a
second
time
and
his
head
began
to
swim
the
ground
began
to
sway
under
his
feet
like
the
deck
of
a
ship
in
a
rolling
sea
He
began
to
cry
out
and
gasp
and
weep
all
at
the
same
instant
He
was
utterly
overwhelmed
He
had
so
blindly
believed
in
his
wife
the
possibility
of
deception
of
treason
had
never
presented
itself
to
his
mind
This
Ernest
his
wife
s
lover
was
a
fair-haired
pretty
boy
of
three-and-twenty
with
a
little
turned-up
nose
and
refined
little
moustaches
almost
the
most
insignificant
of
all
her
acquaintances
A
few
minutes
passed
half
an
hour
passed
Lavretsky
still
stood
crushing
the
fatal
note
in
his
hands
and
gazing
senselessly
at
the
floor
across
a
kind
of
tempest
of
darkness
pale
shapes
hovered
about
him
his
heart
was
numb
with
anguish
he
seemed
to
be
falling
falling
and
a
bottomless
abyss
was
opening
at
his
feet
A
familiar
light
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
roused
him
from
his
numbness
Varvara
Pavlovna
in
her
hat
and
shawl
was
returning
in
haste
from
her
walk
Lavretsky
trembled
all
over
and
rushed
away
he
felt
that
at
that
instant
he
was
capable
of
tearing
her
to
pieces
beating
her
to
death
as
a
peasant
might
do
strangling
her
with
his
own
hands
Varvara
Pavlovna
in
amazement
tried
to
stop
him
he
could
only
whisper
Betsy
and
ran
out
of
the
house
Lavretsky
took
a
cab
and
ordered
the
man
to
drive
him
out
of
town
All
the
rest
of
the
day
and
the
whole
night
he
wandered
about
constantly
stopping
short
and
wringing
his
hands
at
one
moment
he
was
mad
and
the
next
he
was
ready
to
laugh
was
even
merry
after
a
fashion
By
the
morning
he
grew
calm
through
exhaustion
and
went
into
a
wretched
tavern
in
the
outskirts
asked
for
a
room
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
before
the
window
He
was
overtaken
by
a
fit
of
convulsive
yawning
He
could
scarcely
stand
upright
his
whole
body
was
worn
out
and
he
did
not
even
feel
fatigue
though
fatigue
began
to
do
its
work
he
sat
and
gazed
and
comprehended
nothing
he
did
not
understand
what
had
happened
to
him
why
he
found
himself
alone
with
his
limbs
stiff
with
a
taste
of
bitterness
in
his
mouth
with
a
load
on
his
heart
in
an
empty
unfamiliar
room
he
did
not
understand
what
had
impelled
her
his
Varya
to
give
herself
to
this
Frenchman
and
how
knowing
herself
unfaithful
she
could
go
on
being
just
as
calm
just
as
affectionate
as
confidential
with
him
as
before
I
can
not
understand
it
his
parched
lips
whispered
Who
can
guarantee
now
that
even
in
Petersburg
And
he
did
not
finish
the
question
and
yawned
again
shivering
and
shaking
all
over
Memories
bright
and
gloomy
fretted
him
alike
suddenly
it
crossed
his
mind
how
some
days
before
she
had
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
sung
before
him
and
Ernest
the
song
Old
husband
cruel
husband
He
recalled
the
expression
of
her
face
the
strange
light
in
her
eyes
and
the
colour
on
her
cheeks
and
he
got
up
from
his
seat
he
would
have
liked
to
go
to
them
to
tell
them
You
were
wrong
to
play
your
tricks
on
me
my
great-grandfather
used
to
hang
the
peasants
up
by
their
ribs
and
my
grandfather
was
himself
a
peasant
and
to
kill
them
both
Then
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
all
that
was
happening
was
a
dream
scarcely
even
a
dream
but
some
kind
of
foolish
joke
that
he
need
only
shake
himself
and
look
round
He
looked
round
and
like
a
hawk
clutching
its
captured
prey
anguish
gnawed
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
heart
To
complete
it
all
Lavretsky
had
been
hoping
in
a
few
months
to
be
a
father
The
past
the
future
his
whole
life
was
poisoned
He
went
back
at
last
to
Paris
stopped
at
an
hotel
and
sent
M
Ernest
s
note
to
Varvara
Pavlovna
with
the
following
letter
The
enclosed
scrap
of
paper
will
explain
everything
to
you
Let
me
tell
you
by
the
way
that
I
was
surprised
at
you
you
who
are
always
so
careful
to
leave
such
valuable
papers
lying
about
Poor
Lavretsky
had
spent
hours
preparing
and
gloating
over
this
phrase
I
can
not
see
you
again
I
imagine
that
you
too
would
hardly
desire
an
interview
with
me
I
am
assigning
you
15,000
francs
a
year
I
can
not
give
more
Send
your
address
to
the
office
of
the
estate
Do
what
you
please
live
where
you
please
I
wish
you
happiness
No
answer
is
needed
Lavretsky
wrote
to
his
wife
that
he
needed
no
answer
but
he
waited
he
thirsted
for
a
reply
for
an
explanation
of
this
incredible
inconceivable
thing
Varvara
Pavlovna
wrote
him
the
same
day
a
long
letter
in
French
It
put
the
finishing
touch
his
last
doubts
vanished
and
he
began
to
feel
ashamed
that
he
had
still
had
any
doubt
left
Varvara
Pavlovna
did
not
attempt
to
defend
herself
her
only
desire
was
to
see
him
she
besought
him
not
to
condemn
her
irrevocably
The
letter
was
cold
and
constrained
though
here
and
there
traces
of
tears
were
visible
Lavretsky
smiled
bitterly
and
sent
word
by
the
messenger
that
it
was
all
right
Three
days
later
he
was
no
longer
in
Paris
but
he
did
not
go
to
Russia
but
to
Italy
He
did
not
know
himself
why
he
fixed
upon
Italy
he
did
not
really
care
where
he
went
so
long
as
it
was
not
home
He
sent
instructions
to
his
steward
on
the
subject
of
his
wife
s
allowance
and
at
the
same
time
told
him
to
take
all
control
of
his
property
out
of
General
Korobyin
s
hands
at
once
without
waiting
for
him
to
draw
up
an
account
and
to
make
arrangements
for
his
Excellency
s
departure
from
Lavriky
he
could
picture
vividly
the
confusion
the
vain
airs
of
self-importance
of
the
dispossessed
general
and
in
the
midst
of
all
his
sorrow
he
felt
a
kind
of
spiteful
satisfaction
At
the
same
time
he
asked
Glafira
Petrovna
by
letter
to
return
to
Lavriky
and
drew
up
a
deed
authorising
her
to
take
possession
Glafira
Petrovna
did
not
return
to
Lavriky
and
printed
in
the
newspapers
that
the
deed
was
cancelled
which
was
perfectly
unnecessary
on
her
part
Lavretsky
kept
out
of
sight
in
a
small
Italian
town
but
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
help
following
his
wife
s
movements
From
the
newspapers
he
learned
that
she
had
gone
from
Paris
to
Baden
as
she
had
arranged
her
name
soon
appeared
in
an
article
written
by
the
same
M
Jules
In
this
article
there
was
a
kind
of
sympathetic
condolence
apparent
under
the
habitual
playfulness
there
was
a
deep
sense
of
disgust
in
the
soul
of
Fedor
Ivanitch
as
he
read
this
article
Afterwards
he
learned
that
a
daughter
had
been
born
to
him
two
months
later
he
received
a
notification
from
his
steward
that
Varvara
Pavlovna
had
asked
for
the
first
quarter
s
allowance
Then
worse
and
worse
rumors
began
to
reach
him
at
last
a
tragic-comic
story
was
reported
with
acclamations
in
all
the
papers
His
wife
played
an
unenviable
part
in
it
It
was
the
finishing
stroke
Varvara
Pavlovna
had
become
a
notoriety
Lavretsky
ceased
to
follow
her
movements
but
he
could
not
quickly
gain
mastery
over
himself
Sometimes
he
was
overcome
by
such
a
longing
for
his
wife
that
he
would
have
given
up
everything
he
thought
even
perhaps
could
have
forgiven
her
only
to
hear
her
caressing
voice
again
to
feel
again
her
hand
in
his
Time
however
did
not
pass
in
vain
He
was
not
born
to
be
a
victim
his
healthy
nature
reasserted
its
rights
Much
became
clear
to
him
even
the
blow
that
had
fallen
on
him
no
longer
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
quite
unforeseen
he
understood
his
wife
we
can
only
fully
understand
those
who
are
near
to
us
when
we
are
separated
from
them
He
could
take
up
his
interests
could
work
again
though
with
nothing
like
his
former
zeal
scepticism
half-formed
already
by
the
experiences
of
his
life
and
by
his
education
took
complete
possession
of
his
heart
He
became
indifferent
to
everything
Four
years
passed
by
and
he
felt
himself
strong
enough
to
return
to
his
country
to
meet
his
own
people
Without
stopping
at
Petersburg
or
at
Moscow
he
came
to
the
town
of
O
where
we
parted
from
him
and
whither
we
will
now
ask
the
indulgent
reader
to
return
with
us
The
morning
after
the
day
we
have
described
at
ten
o
clock
Lavretsky
was
mounting
the
steps
of
the
Kalitins
house
He
was
met
by
Lisa
coming
out
in
her
hat
and
gloves
Where
are
you
going
he
asked
her
To
service
It
is
Sunday
Why
do
you
go
to
church
Lisa
looked
at
him
in
silent
amazement
I
beg
your
pardon
said
Lavretsky
I
I
did
not
mean
to
say
that
I
have
come
to
say
good-bye
to
you
I
am
starting
for
my
village
in
an
hour
Is
it
far
from
here
asked
Lisa
Twenty
miles
Lenotchka
made
her
appearance
in
the
doorway
escorted
by
a
maid
Mind
you
don
t
forget
us
observed
Lisa
and
went
down
the
steps
And
don
t
you
forget
me
And
listen
he
added
you
are
going
to
church
while
you
are
there
pray
for
me
too
Lisa
stopped
short
and
turned
round
to
him
Certainly
she
said
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
I
will
pray
for
you
too
Come
Lenotchka
In
the
drawing-room
Lavretsky
found
Marya
Dmitrievna
alone
She
was
redolent
of
eau
de
Cologne
and
mint
She
had
as
she
said
a
headache
and
had
passed
a
restless
night
She
received
him
with
her
usual
languid
graciousness
and
gradually
fell
into
conversation
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
is
really
a
delightful
young
man
don
t
you
think
so
she
asked
him
What
Vladimir
Nikolaitch
Panshin
to
be
sure
who
was
here
yesterday
He
took
a
tremendous
fancy
to
you
I
will
tell
you
a
secret
mon
cher
cousin
he
is
simply
crazy
about
my
Lisa
Well
he
is
of
good
family
has
a
capital
position
in
the
service
and
a
clever
fellow
a
kammer-yunker
and
if
it
is
God
s
will
I
for
my
part
as
a
mother
shall
be
well
pleased
My
responsibility
of
course
is
immense
the
happiness
of
children
depends
no
doubt
on
parts
still
I
may
say
up
till
now
for
better
or
for
worse
I
have
done
everything
I
alone
have
been
everywhere
with
them
that
is
to
say
I
have
educated
my
children
and
taught
them
everything
myself
Now
indeed
I
have
written
for
a
French
governess
from
Madame
Boluce
Marya
Dmitrievna
launched
into
a
description
of
her
cares
and
anxieties
and
maternal
sentiments
Lavretsky
listened
in
silence
turning
his
hat
in
his
hands
His
cold
weary
glance
embarrassed
the
gossiping
lady
And
do
you
like
Lisa
she
asked
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
is
an
excellent
girl
replied
Lavretsky
and
he
got
up
took
his
leave
and
went
off
to
Marfa
Timofyevna
Marya
Dmitrievna
looked
after
him
in
high
displeasure
and
thought
What
a
dolt
a
regular
peasant
Well
now
I
understand
why
his
wife
could
not
remain
faithful
to
him
Marfa
Timofyevna
was
sitting
in
her
room
surrounded
by
her
little
court
It
consisted
of
five
creatures
almost
equally
near
to
her
heart
a
big-cropped
learned
bullfinch
which
she
had
taken
a
fancy
to
because
he
had
lost
his
accomplishments
of
whistling
and
drawing
water
a
very
timid
and
peaceable
little
dog
Roska
an
ill-tempered
cat
Matross
a
dark-faced
agile
little
girl
nine
years
old
with
big
eyes
and
a
sharp
nose
call
Shurotchka
and
an
elderly
woman
of
fifty-five
in
a
white
cap
and
a
cinnamon-coloured
abbreviated
jacket
over
a
dark
skirt
by
name
Nastasya
Karpovna
Ogarkov
Shurotchka
was
an
orphan
of
the
tradesman
class
Marfa
Timofyevna
had
taken
her
to
her
heart
like
Roska
from
compassion
she
had
found
the
little
dog
and
the
little
girl
too
in
the
street
both
were
thin
and
hungry
both
were
being
drenched
by
the
autumn
rain
no
one
came
in
search
of
Roska
and
Shurotchka
was
given
up
to
Marfa
Timofyevna
with
positive
eagerness
by
her
uncle
a
drunken
shoemaker
who
did
not
get
enough
to
eat
himself
and
did
not
feed
his
niece
but
beat
her
over
the
head
with
his
last
With
Nastasya
Karpovna
Marfa
Timofyevna
had
made
acquaintance
on
a
pilgrimage
at
a
monastery
she
had
gone
up
to
her
at
the
church
Marfa
Timofyevna
took
a
fancy
to
her
because
in
her
own
words
she
said
her
prayers
so
prettily
and
had
addressed
her
and
invited
her
to
a
cup
of
tea
From
that
day
she
never
parted
from
her
Nastasya
Karpovna
was
a
woman
of
the
most
cheerful
and
gentle
disposition
a
widow
without
children
of
a
poor
noble
family
she
had
a
round
grey
head
soft
white
hands
a
soft
face
with
large
mild
features
and
a
rather
absurd
turned-up
nose
she
stood
in
awe
of
Marfa
Timofyevna
and
the
latter
was
very
fond
of
her
though
she
laughed
at
her
susceptibility
She
had
a
soft
place
in
her
heart
for
every
young
man
and
could
not
help
blushing
like
a
girl
at
the
most
innocent
joke
Her
whole
fortune
consisted
of
only
1200
roubles
she
lived
at
Marfa
Timofyevna
s
expense
but
on
an
equal
footing
with
her
Marfa
Timofyevna
would
not
have
put
up
with
any
servility
Ah
Fedya
she
began
directly
she
saw
him
last
night
you
did
not
see
my
family
you
must
admire
them
we
are
all
here
together
for
tea
this
is
our
second
holiday
tea
You
can
make
friends
with
them
all
only
Shurotchka
won
t
let
you
and
the
cat
will
scratch
Are
you
starting
to-day
Yes
Lavretsky
sat
down
on
a
low
seat
I
have
just
said
good-bye
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
I
saw
Lisaveta
Mihalovna
too
Call
her
Lisa
my
dear
fellow
Mihalovna
indeed
to
you
But
sit
still
or
you
will
break
Shurotchka
s
little
chair
She
has
gone
to
church
continued
Lavretsky
Is
she
religious
Yes
Fedya
very
much
so
More
than
you
and
I
Fedya
Aren
t
you
religious
then
lisped
Nastasya
Karpovna
To-day
you
have
not
been
to
the
early
service
but
you
are
going
to
the
late
No
not
at
all
you
will
go
alone
I
have
grown
too
lazy
my
dear
relied
Marfa
Timofyevna
Already
I
am
indulging
myself
with
tea
She
addressed
Nastasya
Karpovna
in
the
singular
though
she
treated
her
as
an
equal
She
was
not
a
Pestov
for
nothing
three
Pestovs
had
been
on
the
death-list
of
Ivan
the
Terrible
Marfa
Timofyevna
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
Tell
me
please
began
Lavretsky
again
Marya
Dmitrievna
has
just
been
talking
to
me
about
this
what
s
his
name
Panshin
What
sort
of
a
man
is
he
What
a
chatterbox
she
is
Lord
save
us
muttered
Marfa
Timofyevna
She
told
you
I
suppose
as
a
secret
that
he
has
turned
up
as
a
suitor
She
might
have
whispered
it
to
her
priest
s
son
no
he
s
not
good
enough
for
her
it
seems
And
so
far
there
s
nothing
to
tell
thank
God
but
already
she
s
gossiping
about
it
Why
thank
God
asked
Lavretsky
Because
I
don
t
like
the
fine
young
gentleman
and
so
what
is
there
to
be
glad
of
in
it
You
don
t
like
him
No
he
can
t
fascinate
every
one
He
must
be
satisfied
with
Nastasya
Karpovna
s
being
in
love
with
him
The
poor
widow
was
utterly
dismayed
How
can
you
Marfa
Timofyevna
you
ve
no
conscience
she
cried
and
a
crimson
flush
instantly
overspread
her
face
and
neck
And
he
knows
to
be
sure
the
rogue
Marfa
Timofyevna
interrupted
her
he
knows
how
to
captivate
her
he
made
her
a
present
of
a
snuff-box
Fedya
ask
her
for
a
pinch
of
snuff
you
will
see
what
a
splendid
snuff-box
it
is
on
the
lid
a
hussar
on
horseback
You
d
better
not
try
to
defend
yourself
my
dear
Nastasya
Karpovna
could
only
fling
up
her
hands
Well
but
Lisa
inquired
Lavretsky
is
she
indifferent
to
him
She
seems
to
like
him
but
there
God
knows
The
heart
of
another
you
know
is
a
dark
forest
and
a
girl
s
more
than
any
Shurotchka
s
heart
for
instance
I
defy
you
to
understand
it
What
makes
her
hide
herself
and
not
come
out
ever
since
you
came
in
Shurotchka
choked
with
suppressed
laughter
and
skipped
out
of
the
room
Lavretsky
rose
from
his
place
Yes
he
said
in
an
uncertain
voice
there
is
no
deciphering
a
girl
s
heart
He
began
to
say
good-bye
Well
shall
we
see
you
again
soon
inquired
Marfa
Timofyevna
Very
likely
aunt
it
s
not
far
off
you
know
Yes
to
be
sure
you
are
going
to
Vassilyevskoe
You
don
t
care
to
stay
at
Lavriky
well
that
s
your
own
affair
only
mind
you
go
and
say
a
prayer
at
our
mother
s
grave
and
our
grandmother
s
too
while
you
are
there
Out
there
in
foreign
parts
you
have
picked
up
all
kinds
of
ideas
but
who
knows
Perhaps
even
in
their
graves
they
will
feel
that
you
have
come
to
them
And
Fedya
don
t
forget
to
have
a
service
sung
too
for
Glafira
Petrovna
here
s
a
silver
rouble
for
you
Take
it
take
it
I
want
to
pay
for
a
service
for
her
I
had
no
love
for
her
in
her
lifetime
but
all
the
same
there
s
no
denying
she
was
a
girl
of
character
She
was
a
clever
creature
and
a
good
friend
to
you
And
now
go
and
God
be
with
you
before
I
weary
you
And
Marfa
Timofyevna
embraced
her
nephew
And
Lisa
s
not
going
to
marry
Panshin
don
t
you
trouble
yourself
that
s
not
the
sort
of
husband
she
deserves
Oh
I
m
not
troubling
myself
answered
Lavretsky
and
went
away
Four
days
later
he
set
off
for
home
His
coach
rolled
quickly
along
the
soft
cross-road
There
had
been
no
rain
for
a
fortnight
a
fine
milk
mist
was
diffused
in
the
air
and
hung
over
the
distant
woods
a
smell
of
burning
came
from
it
A
multitude
of
darkish
clouds
with
blurred
edges
were
creeping
across
the
pale
blue
sky
a
fairly
strong
breeze
blew
a
dry
and
steady
gale
without
dispelling
the
heat
Leaning
back
with
his
head
on
the
cushion
and
his
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
Lavretsky
watched
the
furrowed
fields
unfolding
like
a
fan
before
him
the
willow
bushes
as
they
slowly
came
into
sight
and
the
dull
ravens
and
rooks
who
looked
sidelong
with
stupid
suspicion
at
the
approaching
carriage
the
long
ditches
overgrown
with
mugwort
wormwood
and
mountain
ash
and
as
he
watched
the
fresh
fertile
wilderness
and
solitude
of
this
steppe
country
the
greenness
the
long
slopes
and
valleys
with
stunted
oak
bushes
the
grey
villages
and
scant
birch
trees
the
whole
Russian
landscape
so
long
unseen
by
him
stirred
emotion
at
once
pleasant
sweet
and
almost
painful
in
his
heart
and
he
felt
weighed
down
by
a
kind
of
pleasant
oppression
Slowly
his
thoughts
wandered
their
outlines
were
as
vague
and
indistinct
as
the
outlines
of
the
clouds
which
seemed
to
be
wandering
at
random
overhead
He
remembered
his
childhood
his
mother
he
remembered
her
death
how
they
had
carried
him
in
to
her
and
how
clasping
his
head
to
her
bosom
she
had
begun
to
wail
over
him
then
had
glanced
at
Glafira
Petrovna
and
checked
herself
He
remembered
his
father
at
first
vigorous
discontented
with
everything
with
strident
voice
and
later
blind
tearful
with
unkempt
grey
beard
he
remembered
how
one
day
after
drinking
a
glass
too
much
at
dinner
and
spilling
the
gravy
over
his
napkin
he
began
to
relate
his
conquests
growing
red
in
the
face
and
winking
with
his
sightless
eyes
he
remember
Varvara
Pavlovna
and
involuntarily
shuddered
as
a
man
shudders
from
a
sudden
internal
pain
and
shook
his
head
Then
his
thoughts
came
to
a
stop
at
Lisa
There
he
thought
Is
a
new
creature
only
just
entering
on
life
A
nice
girl
what
will
become
of
her
She
is
good-looking
too
A
pale
fresh
face
mouth
and
eyes
so
serious
and
an
honest
innocent
expression
It
is
a
pity
she
seems
a
little
enthusiastic
A
good
figure
and
she
moves
so
lightly
and
a
soft
voice
I
like
the
way
she
stops
suddenly
listens
attentively
without
a
smile
then
grows
thoughtful
and
shakes
back
her
hair
I
fancy
too
that
Panshin
is
not
good
enough
for
her
What
s
amiss
with
him
though
And
besides
what
business
have
I
to
wonder
about
it
She
will
go
along
the
same
road
as
all
the
rest
I
had
better
go
to
sleep
And
Lavretsky
closed
his
eyes
He
could
not
