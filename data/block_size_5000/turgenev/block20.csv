presence
of
guests
least
of
all
of
those
upstarts
and
good-for-nothings
as
she
termed
our
friends
In
fact
though
she
confined
herself
in
the
drawing-room
or
the
dining-room
to
sulking
she
resorted
when
alone
with
her
maid
in
the
bedroom
to
abuse
of
Arkady
and
Bazarov
which
made
her
cap
and
her
false
front
fairly
dance
on
her
head
These
things
of
course
Madame
Odintsov
knew
Why
need
you
depart
she
said
to
Bazarov
Have
you
forgotten
your
promise
Bazarov
started
What
promise
he
asked
Then
you
have
forgotten
it
I
mean
the
promise
to
give
me
a
few
lessons
in
chemistry
How
can
I
fulfil
it
My
father
is
expecting
me
at
home
and
I
ought
not
to
stay
a
day
longer
You
had
better
read
through
Notions
Générales
de
Chimie
by
Pelouse
and
Frémy
It
is
an
excellent
work
and
clearly
written
the
very
thing
you
want
But
you
said
that
no
book
can
adequately
replace
I
forget
the
exact
phrase
you
used
but
you
know
what
I
mean
do
you
not
I
can
not
help
myself
he
muttered
Nevertheless
why
go
She
lowered
her
voice
as
she
spoke
Bazarov
glanced
at
her
as
she
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
crossed
her
arms
which
were
bare
to
the
elbow
and
saw
that
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
softened
with
a
shade
of
pleated
paper
she
was
looking
paler
than
usual
also
that
the
outlines
of
her
figure
were
almost
buried
in
a
soft
white
gown
from
underneath
which
there
peeped
forth
the
tips
of
her
toes
posed
crosswise
What
reason
should
I
have
for
remaining
he
replied
She
gave
her
head
the
faintest
toss
What
reason
should
you
have
she
re-echoed
Well
are
you
not
happy
here
Do
you
think
that
there
will
be
no
one
to
regret
your
departure
There
will
be
no
one
Of
that
I
am
certain
Then
you
are
wrong
came
the
reply
after
a
pause
But
I
do
not
believe
you
I
have
an
idea
that
you
are
not
speaking
seriously
Bazarov
said
nothing
Why
do
you
not
answer
me
she
persisted
What
is
there
to
say
In
general
to
regret
people
's
absence
is
not
worth
while
and
least
of
all
the
absence
of
people
like
myself
Why
again
Because
I
am
a
prosaic
and
eminently
uninteresting
individual
Nor
do
I
know
how
to
talk
But
you
know
how
to
play
the
esquire
No
not
even
that
And
as
you
know
the
softer
aspect
of
life
the
aspect
which
you
hold
so
dear
lies
altogether
beyond
me
Madame
Odintsov
nibbled
the
corner
of
her
handkerchief
Think
what
you
like
she
said
but
at
least
I
shall
find
things
dull
when
you
are
gone
Arkady
will
remain
he
hazarded
She
shrugged
her
shoulders
Nevertheless
I
shall
find
the
time
wearisome
she
repeated
Not
for
long
Why
not
Because
as
you
have
very
truly
said
things
never
seem
dull
to
you
save
when
your
régime
is
infringed
In
fact
with
such
faultless
regularity
have
you
ordered
your
life
that
there
abides
in
it
no
room
for
dullness
or
depression
or
any
other
burdensome
feeling
And
I
too
am
faultless
I
suppose
I
have
ordered
my
life
too
regularly
ever
to
err
I
daresay
Take
an
example
of
it
In
a
few
minutes
it
will
be
ten
o'clock
when
as
I
know
by
experience
you
will
request
me
to
leave
your
presence
Oh
no
I
shall
not
You
may
remain
By
the
way
please
open
that
window
The
room
is
simply
stifling
Bazarov
rose
and
unfastened
the
casement
which
swung
backwards
with
a
snap
for
the
reason
that
he
had
not
expected
it
to
open
so
easily
and
that
his
hands
were
trembling
Into
the
aperture
glanced
the
soft
warm
night
with
its
vista
of
dark
vault
of
heaven
faintly
rustling
trees
and
pure
free
sweet-scented
air
Also
please
pull
down
the
blind
and
then
resume
your
seat
I
wish
to
have
a
little
further
talk
with
you
before
you
go
Tell
me
something
about
yourself
a
person
to
whom
by
the
way
you
never
refer
I
would
rather
converse
with
you
on
more
profitable
subjects
What
modesty
Nevertheless
I
wish
to
learn
something
of
you
and
of
your
family
and
of
the
father
for
whose
sake
you
are
soon
going
to
abandon
me
Why
the
word
'abandon
reflected
Bazarov
Then
he
added
aloud
Things
of
that
kind
interest
no
one
least
of
all
you
I
and
my
people
are
obscure
folk
Whereas
I
you
imagine
am
an
aristocrat
Bazarov
looked
up
Yes
he
replied
with
emphasis
She
smiled
Then
I
can
see
that
your
knowledge
of
me
is
small
she
remarked
But
of
course
you
believe
all
human
beings
to
be
identical
and
therefore
not
worth
the
trouble
of
studying
Some
day
I
will
tell
you
my
history
But
first
tell
me
yours
You
say
that
my
knowledge
of
you
is
small
queried
Bazarov
You
may
be
right
Possibly
every
human
being
is
an
enigma
Let
us
take
an
example
of
that
You
have
withdrawn
from
society
and
find
it
irksome
and
limit
your
visitors
list
to
a
couple
of
students
Yet
why
with
your
intellect
and
your
beauty
do
you
live
in
the
country
Why
came
the
sharp
rejoinder
But
first
be
so
good
as
to
explain
what
you
mean
by
my
'beauty
Bazarov
frowned
That
lies
beside
the
point
he
muttered
The
point
is
that
I
can
not
understand
why
you
settle
in
a
rural
spot
of
this
kind
You
can
not
understand
it
you
can
not
explain
it
No
There
is
only
one
possible
explanation
and
that
is
that
you
remain
here
because
you
are
a
person
of
self-indulgence
who
love
comfort
and
the
amenities
of
life
and
are
indifferent
to
aught
else
Again
Madame
Odintsov
smiled
Then
you
are
still
determined
to
believe
that
I
am
incapable
of
being
moved
she
said
Bazarov
glanced
at
her
from
under
his
brows
By
curiosity
yes
he
said
But
by
nothing
else
Indeed
Then
I
cease
to
wonder
that
you
and
I
do
not
get
on
together
You
are
exactly
like
myself
That
you
and
I
do
not
get
on
together
echoed
Bazarov
vaguely
Yes
But
I
had
forgotten
you
must
be
longing
to
retire
Bazarov
rose
The
lamp
was
casting
a
dim
light
while
into
the
fragrant
darkened
isolated
room
there
came
wafted
at
intervals
under
the
swinging
blind
the
sensuous
freshness
of
the
night
and
the
sounds
of
its
mysterious
whisperings
Madame
Odintsov
did
not
stir
Over
her
was
stealing
the
same
strange
agitation
which
had
infected
Bazarov
Suddenly
he
realised
that
he
was
alone
with
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
Need
you
go
she
asked
slowly
He
made
no
reply
he
merely
resumed
his
seat
Then
you
think
me
a
spoilt
pampered
indolent
person
she
continued
in
the
same
slow
tone
as
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
window
Yet
this
much
I
know
about
myself
that
I
am
very
unhappy
Unhappy
For
what
reason
Because
you
attach
too
much
importance
to
petty
slanders
She
frowned
Somehow
she
felt
vexed
that
he
should
have
understood
her
thus
No
things
of
that
kind
do
not
disturb
me
she
said
Never
should
I
allow
them
to
do
so
I
am
too
proud
The
reason
why
I
am
unhappy
is
that
I
have
no
wish
no
enthusiasm
to
live
I
daresay
you
will
not
believe
me
and
will
think
that
a
mere
'petty
aristocrat
a
person
who
is
lapped
in
lace
and
seated
in
an
armchair
is
saying
all
this
and
I
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
I
love
what
you
call
'the
comforts
of
life
yet
all
the
while
I
feel
as
though
I
had
no
desire
to
continue
my
existence
Pray
reconcile
that
contradiction
if
you
can
But
perhaps
you
consider
what
I
say
'Romanticism
Bazarov
shook
his
head
You
are
yet
young
he
said
Also
you
are
rich
and
independent
What
more
could
you
have
What
more
do
you
desire
What
more
she
re-echoed
with
a
sigh
I
do
not
know
I
only
know
that
I
feel
tired
antiquated
I
feel
as
though
I
had
been
living
a
long
long
time
Yes
I
am
growing
old
she
continued
as
she
drew
the
ends
of
her
mantilla
around
her
bare
shoulders
In
doing
so
she
glanced
at
Bazarov
Her
eyes
met
his
and
the
faintest
of
blushes
stole
into
her
face
Behind
me
lie
many
memories
memories
of
my
life
in
St
Petersburg
of
a
period
of
wealth
followed
by
poverty
of
my
father's
death
of
my
marriage
of
my
travels
abroad
yes
many
such
memories
there
are
Yet
none
of
them
are
worth
cherishing
And
before
me
lies
only
a
weary
road
with
no
goal
to
it
along
which
I
have
no
desire
to
travel
You
are
disenchanted
said
Bazarov
No
she
replied
with
a
shiver
Rather
I
am
dissatisfied
Oh
that
I
could
form
a
strong
attachment
of
some
kind
To
fall
in
love
might
save
you
remarked
Bazarov
But
you
are
incapable
of
that
That
is
where
your
misfortune
lies
Madame
dropped
her
eyes
upon
the
sleeve
of
her
mantilla
I
am
incapable
of
falling
in
love
she
murmured
Not
altogether
Moreover
I
did
wrong
to
call
it
a
misfortune
for
the
person
most
to
be
pitied
is
the
person
who
meets
with
that
experience
What
experience
do
you
mean
The
experience
of
falling
in
love
How
come
you
to
know
that
By
hearsay
he
replied
irritably
while
to
himself
he
added
You
are
a
mere
coquette
whom
sheer
idleness
is
leading
to
weary
and
madden
me
And
his
heart
swelled
within
him
On
the
other
hand
he
went
on
it
may
be
that
you
are
too
exacting
As
he
spoke
he
bent
forward
and
fell
to
playing
with
the
tassels
of
his
chair
Possibly
I
am
she
agreed
But
you
see
I
conceive
that
it
ought
to
be
everything
or
nothing
'A
life
for
a
life
'Take
my
all
give
your
all
and
put
a
truce
to
regrets
and
any
thought
of
return
That
is
the
best
rule
Indeed
queried
Bazarov
Well
it
is
not
a
bad
rule
and
I
am
surprised
that
you
should
have
failed
to
attain
your
desire
Self-surrender
you
think
is
an
easy
thing
Not
if
one
considers
matters
first
and
appraises
oneself
and
sets
upon
oneself
a
definite
value
It
is
only
surrender
without
consideration
that
is
easy
But
how
could
one
not
value
oneself
If
one
had
value
no
one
would
desire
one
's
surrender
That
would
not
be
your
concern
nor
mine
some
one
else
's
business
would
it
be
to
determine
our
respective
values
The
one
thing
that
would
immediately
concern
us
would
be
to
know
how
to
surrender
Madame
Odintsov
sat
up
sharply
I
still
believe
you
to
be
speaking
from
experience
she
said
No
words
idle
words
words
not
meant
to
be
taken
personally
Then
you
yourself
might
be
capable
of
surrendering
I
might
But
in
any
case
I
should
not
care
to
boast
Both
remained
silent
for
a
moment
From
the
drawing-room
came
the
notes
of
the
piano
How
late
Katia
is
playing
remarked
Anna
Sergievna
Bazarov
raised
his
head
Yes
it
is
late
he
said
Time
for
you
to
go
to
rest
Wait
a
moment
however
Why
should
you
hurry
away
I
have
something
more
to
say
to
you
What
may
it
be
Wait
she
repeated
As
she
did
so
her
eyes
gazed
at
him
as
though
studying
his
personality
For
a
few
moments
he
paced
the
room
then
suddenly
approached
her
said
Good
night
squeezed
her
hand
until
she
could
have
shrieked
with
the
pain
and
departed
Raising
her
fingers
to
her
lips
she
blew
after
him
a
kiss
Then
rising
with
an
abrupt
convulsive
movement
she
ran
towards
the
door
as
though
to
call
him
back
But
at
that
moment
her
maid
entered
with
a
decanter
on
a
silver
tray
and
Madame
halted
bid
the
maid
begone
reseated
herself
and
sank
into
a
reverie
Her
hair
like
a
winding
black
snake
had
broken
loose
from
its
fastenings
Dimly
illumined
by
the
lamp
she
sat
motionless
save
that
at
intervals
she
chafed
her
hands
for
the
night
air
was
beginning
to
grow
chilly
Two
hours
later
Bazarov
re-entered
his
bedroom
in
a
state
of
dishevelment
and
despondency
and
with
his
boots
soaked
with
dew
Arkady
was
seated
fully
dressed
at
the
writing-table
with
a
book
in
his
hands
So
you
are
not
in
bed
yet
Bazarov
remarked
irritably
Arkady
's
only
reply
was
to
ask
the
counter-question
You
have
been
sitting
with
Anna
Sergievna
have
you
not
I
have
replied
Bazarov
I
was
sitting
there
while
you
and
Katia
were
playing
the
piano
Oh
I
was
not
playing
retorted
Arkady
Then
he
stopped
for
he
felt
the
tears
to
be
very
near
his
eyes
and
had
no
wish
to
let
them
fall
in
the
presence
of
his
satirical
mentor
When
Madame
Odintsov
entered
the
breakfast-room
next
morning
Bazarov
had
been
sitting
over
his
cup
for
a
considerable
time
He
glanced
sharply
at
her
as
she
opened
the
door
and
she
turned
in
his
direction
as
inevitably
as
though
he
had
signed
to
her
to
do
so
Somehow
her
face
looked
pale
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
returned
to
her
boudoir
whence
she
issued
again
only
at
luncheon
time
Since
dawn
the
weather
had
been
too
rainy
to
admit
of
outdoor
expeditions
and
therefore
the
party
adjourned
to
the
drawing-room
where
Arkady
began
to
read
aloud
the
latest
number
of
some
journal
while
the
Princess
manifested
her
usual
surprise
at
his
conduct
as
though
it
had
been
conduct
of
an
indecent
nature
and
fixed
upon
him
a
gaze
which
though
one
of
lasting
malignancy
proved
also
to
be
one
of
which
he
took
not
the
slightest
notice
Pray
come
to
my
boudoir
Evgenii
Vasilitch
said
Anna
Sergievna
I
have
something
to
ask
you
I
think
that
last
night
you
mentioned
some
textbook
or
another
Rising
she
moved
towards
the
door
whilst
the
Princess
stared
around
the
room
as
much
as
to
say
Dear
dear
This
does
surprise
me
Then
she
brought
her
eyes
back
to
Arkady
who
raising
his
voice
and
bending
towards
Katia
by
whose
side
he
was
sitting
continued
his
reading
as
before
Meanwhile
Madame
Odintsov
walked
hurriedly
to
her
boudoir
and
Bazarov
followed
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
and
his
ears
open
to
no
sound
but
the
faint
rustling
of
a
silk
dress
Arrived
at
her
destination
Madame
seated
herself
in
the
chair
which
she
had
occupied
overnight
and
Bazarov
also
took
a
seat
where
he
had
sat
on
the
occasion
in
question
What
is
the
title
of
the
book
she
asked
after
a
brief
pause
Notions
Générales
by
Pelouse
and
Frémy
I
can
also
recommend
Ganot
's
Traité
Élémentaire
de
Physique
Expérimentale
which
is
more
detailed
in
its
plates
than
the
other
work
and
in
general
is
But
Madame
Odintsov
held
up
her
hand
Pardon
me
she
interrupted
I
have
not
brought
you
here
to
discuss
textbooks
I
have
brought
you
here
to
renew
our
conversation
of
last
night
at
the
point
where
you
left
the
room
so
abruptly
I
hope
that
I
shall
not
weary
you
I
am
entirely
at
your
service
What
was
it
we
were
discussing
She
glanced
at
him
Happiness
I
think
she
said
In
fact
I
was
speaking
to
you
of
myself
The
reason
why
I
mention
happiness
is
the
following
Why
is
it
that
when
one
is
enjoying
say
a
piece
of
music
or
a
beautiful
summer
evening
or
a
conversation
with
a
sympathetic
companion
the
occasion
seems
rather
a
hint
at
an
infinite
felicity
existent
elsewhere
than
a
real
felicity
actually
being
experienced
Perhaps
however
you
have
never
encountered
such
a
phenomenon
'Where
we
are
not
there
do
we
wish
to
be
you
know
the
proverb
Last
night
you
said
that
you
are
dissatisfied
Such
a
thought
never
enters
into
my
head
Is
it
that
such
thoughts
seem
to
you
ridiculous
No
rather
that
they
never
occur
to
me
Indeed
Well
to
know
what
your
thoughts
are
is
a
thing
which
I
greatly
wish
to
attain
I
do
not
understand
you
Then
listen
For
a
long
time
past
I
have
been
wishing
to
have
this
out
with
you
Do
not
tell
me
you
yourself
know
that
it
is
useless
to
do
so
that
you
are
a
man
apart
As
a
matter
of
fact
you
are
a
man
still
young
with
all
your
life
before
you
I
wish
to
know
for
what
you
are
preparing
and
what
future
awaits
you
and
what
is
the
goal
which
you
are
seeking
to
reach
and
whither
you
are
travelling
and
what
you
have
in
your
mind
in
short
who
and
what
you
are
I
am
surprised
Already
you
know
that
I
dabble
in
natural
science
while
as
regards
my
future
Yes
As
regards
your
future
I
have
told
you
that
I
purpose
to
become
a
district
physician
Anna
Sergievna
waved
her
hand
impatiently
Why
tell
me
that
when
you
yourself
do
not
believe
it
It
is
for
Arkady
to
return
me
such
answers
not
you
And
is
Arkady
in
any
way
Wait
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
such
a
modest
rôle
will
really
satisfy
you
when
you
yourself
have
asserted
that
the
science
of
medicine
does
not
exist
No
no
You
have
given
me
that
answer
for
the
reason
that
you
desire
to
keep
me
at
arm
's
length
that
you
have
no
faith
in
me
Then
let
me
tell
you
that
I
am
capable
of
understanding
you
that
I
too
have
known
poverty
and
ambition
that
I
too
have
had
my
experiences
I
daresay
yet
pardon
me
when
I
intimate
that
I
am
not
accustomed
to
bare
my
soul
Moreover
there
is
fixed
between
you
and
me
such
a
gulf
that
A
gulf
Do
you
again
say
that
I
am
an
aristocrat
Come
come
Evgenii
Vasilitch
Have
I
not
already
told
you
that
I
Can
it
avail
anything
to
discuss
the
future
when
for
the
most
part
our
futures
are
wholly
independent
of
ourselves
Should
the
occasion
arise
to
be
up
and
doing
well
and
good
but
should
the
occasion
not
arise
at
least
let
us
leave
ourselves
room
for
thankfulness
that
we
did
not
waste
time
in
useless
chatter
What
You
call
a
friendly
talk
'useless
chatter
Then
do
you
deem
me
as
a
woman
unworthy
of
your
confidence
or
do
you
despise
all
women
You
I
do
not
despise
and
that
you
know
full
well
I
know
nothing
of
the
kind
Of
course
I
can
understand
your
reluctance
to
speak
of
your
future
career
but
as
to
what
is
taking
place
within
you
at
the
present
moment
'Taking
place
within
me
at
the
present
moment
Bazarov
exclaimed
One
would
think
I
was
a
state
or
a
community
Nor
is
it
a
process
which
interests
me
while
in
addition
a
man
can
not
always
put
into
words
'what
is
taking
place
within
him
I
do
not
see
it
Why
should
you
hesitate
to
express
what
may
be
in
your
soul
Could
you
do
as
much
asked
Bazarov
I
could
came
the
reply
after
a
brief
hesitation
Bazarov
bowed
in
an
ironical
manner
Then
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
he
said
Her
glance
quickened
into
a
note
of
interrogation
Very
well
she
said
Yet
I
will
venture
to
say
that
you
and
I
have
not
met
in
vain
and
that
we
shall
always
remain
good
friends
Moreover
I
feel
certain
that
in
time
your
secretiveness
and
reserve
will
disappear
Then
have
you
noticed
in
me
much
such
'secretiveness
and
reserve
I
have
Bazarov
rose
and
moved
towards
the
window
Do
you
really
want
to
know
the
cause
of
that
'secretiveness
and
reserve
he
asked
Do
you
really
want
to
know
'what
is
taking
place
within
me
I
do
she
replied
Yet
even
as
she
spoke
she
felt
run
through
her
a
tinge
of
apprehension
for
which
she
could
not
account
And
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
if
I
tell
you
No
No
He
approached
her
and
halted
behind
her
Learn
then
he
said
that
I
love
you
with
a
blind
insensate
passion
You
have
forced
it
from
me
at
last
She
stretched
out
her
arms
before
her
while
Bazarov
turning
pressed
his
forehead
against
the
window-pane
His
breath
caught
in
his
throat
and
his
whole
body
was
quivering
Yet
this
was
not
the
agitation
born
of
the
diffidence
of
youth
nor
was
it
the
awe
inspired
by
a
first
confession
of
love
Rather
it
was
the
beating
of
a
strong
and
terrible
emotion
which
resembled
madness
and
was
perhaps
akin
to
it
As
for
Madame
Odintsov
a
great
horror
had
come
over
her
also
a
great
feeling
of
compassion
for
him
Evgenii
Vasilitch
she
cried
In
the
words
there
rang
an
involuntary
note
of
tenderness
Wheeling
about
he
devoured
her
with
his
glance
Then
he
seized
her
hands
in
his
and
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
She
did
not
free
herself
at
once
Only
after
a
moment
did
she
withdraw
to
a
corner
and
stand
looking
at
him
He
rushed
towards
her
again
but
she
whispered
in
hurried
alarm
You
have
mistaken
me
Had
he
taken
another
step
she
would
have
screamed
Biting
his
lips
he
left
the
room
Half
an
hour
later
her
maid
brought
her
a
note
It
consisted
of
a
single
line
only
and
said
Must
I
depart
to-day
or
may
I
remain
until
to-morrow
To
it
Anna
Sergievna
replied
Why
depart
I
have
failed
to
understand
you
and
you
have
failed
to
understand
me
that
is
all
But
mentally
she
added
Rather
I
have
failed
to
understand
myself
Until
dinner
time
she
remained
secluded
and
spent
the
hours
in
pacing
her
room
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
Occasionally
she
would
halt
before
the
window-panes
or
a
mirror
to
draw
a
handkerchief
across
a
spot
on
her
neck
which
seemed
to
be
burning
like
fire
And
every
time
that
she
did
so
she
asked
herself
what
had
led
her
to
force
Bazarov's
confidence
also
whether
or
not
she
had
had
any
suspicion
that
such
a
thing
might
result
Yes
I
am
to
blame
she
finally
decided
Yet
I
could
not
have
foreseen
the
whole
dénouement
Then
she
recalled
Bazarov
's
almost
animal
face
as
he
rushed
to
seize
her
in
his
arms
And
at
the
thought
she
blushed
Or
is
it
that
Here
she
stopped
and
shook
back
her
curls
The
reason
was
that
she
had
seen
herself
in
a
mirror
and
as
in
a
flash
had
learnt
from
that
image
of
a
head
thrown
back
with
a
mysterious
smile
lurking
between
a
pair
of
half-parted
lips
and
in
a
pair
of
half-closed
eyes
something
which
confounded
her
No
no
Again
no
she
cried
Only
God
knows
what
might
come
of
it
Such
things
are
not
to
be
played
with
Freedom
from
worry
is
the
chief
thing
in
the
world
Nor
had
her
sangfroid
really
been
shattered
Rather
she
was
a
little
agitated
so
little
that
when
for
some
unknown
reason
she
shed
a
tear
or
two
those
tears
owed
their
origin
not
to
any
deep
emotion
to
the
fact
that
she
was
wounded
but
to
a
sense
of
having
involuntarily
been
at
fault
in
permitting
certain
vague
yearnings
a
certain
consciousness
of
the
transience
of
life
a
certain
desire
for
novelty
to
urge
her
towards
the
boundary
line
And
over
that
boundary
line
she
had
peeped
And
in
front
of
her
she
had
beheld
not
an
abyss
but
a
waste
a
sheer
ugliness
In
spite
of
her
self-command
in
spite
of
her
superiority
to
convention
Madame
Odintsov
could
not
but
feel
a
little
uncomfortable
when
she
entered
the
dining-room
for
the
evening
meal
Nevertheless
the
meal
passed
off
without
incident
and
after
it
Porphyri
Platonitch
came
in
and
related
various
anecdotes
on
the
strength
of
a
recent
visit
to
the
neighbouring
town
among
other
things
a
story
to
the
effect
that
Governor
Bardeloue
had
commanded
his
whole
staff
of
officials
to
wear
spurs
in
order
that
if
need
be
he
could
dispatch
them
on
their
errands
on
horseback
Meanwhile
Arkady
talked
in
an
undertone
to
Katia
and
also
paid
diplomatic
attention
to
the
Princess
while
Bazarov
maintained
such
an
obstinate
gloomy
silence
that
Madame
glancing
at
him
as
she
did
twice
and
openly
not
covertly
thought
to
herself
as
she
scanned
his
stern
forbidding
face
downcast
eyes
and
all-pervading
expression
of
rigid
contempt
No
no
Again
no
Dinner
over
she
conducted
her
guests
into
the
garden
and
perceiving
that
Bazarov
desired
a
word
with
her
walked
aside
a
little
halted
and
waited
for
him
Approaching
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
he
said
in
a
dull
way
I
must
beg
your
pardon
Anna
Sergievna
Surely
you
must
be
feeling
extremely
angry
with
me
No
not
angry
so
much
as
grieved
she
replied
So
much
the
worse
But
I
have
received
sufficient
punishment
have
I
not
My
position
now
I
am
sure
that
you
will
agree
with
me
is
a
very
awkward
one
True
you
wrote
in
your
message
'Why
need
you
depart
but
I
can
not
and
will
not
remain
By
to-morrow
therefore
I
shall
have
departed
But
why
need
you
need
you
Why
need
I
depart
No
I
was
going
to
have
said
something
quite
different
We
can
not
recover
the
past
he
continued
and
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
before
this
should
happen
I
know
only
of
one
condition
under
which
I
could
remain
And
that
condition
is
never
likely
to
arise
For
pardon
my
presumption
I
suppose
you
neither
love
me
now
nor
could
ever
do
so
With
the
words
there
came
a
flash
from
under
his
dark
brows
She
did
not
reply
Through
her
brain
there
flitted
only
the
one
thought
I
am
afraid
of
this
man
Farewell
he
continued
as
though
he
had
divined
that
thought
Then
he
moved
away
towards
the
house
Entering
the
house
a
little
later
Anna
Sergievna
called
to
Katia
and
took
the
girl
by
the
arm
nor
throughout
the
rest
of
the
evening
did
she
once
part
from
her
Also
instead
of
joining
in
a
game
of
cards
she
sat
uttering
laugh
after
laugh
of
a
nature
which
ill
consorted
with
her
blanched
and
careworn
face
Gazing
at
her
perplexedly
as
a
young
man
will
do
Arkady
kept
asking
himself
the
question
What
can
this
mean
As
for
Bazarov
he
locked
himself
in
his
room
and
only
appeared
to
join
the
rest
at
tea
When
he
did
so
Anna
Sergievna
yearned
to
say
something
kind
to
him
but
could
think
of
no
words
for
the
purpose
To
her
dilemma
however
an
unexpected
incident
put
an
end
This
was
the
entry
of
the
butler
to
announce
Sitnikov
To
describe
the
craven
fashion
in
which
the
young
Progressive
entered
the
room
would
be
impossible
Although
with
characteristic
importunity
he
had
decided
to
repair
to
the
residence
of
a
lady
with
whom
he
was
barely
acquainted
and
who
had
not
accorded
him
an
invitation
his
pretext
for
such
presumption
being
that
according
to
information
received
she
happened
to
be
entertaining
guests
who
were
both
intellectual
and
very
intimate
with
himself
he
had
since
felt
his
courage
ebb
to
the
marrow
of
his
bones
and
now
instead
of
proffering
all
the
excuses
and
compliments
which
he
had
prepared
in
advance
blurted
out
some
ridiculous
story
to
the
effect
that
Evdoksia
Kukshin
had
sent
him
to
inquire
after
the
health
of
Anna
Sergievna
and
that
Arkady
Nikolaievitch
had
always
spoken
of
him
in
terms
of
the
highest
respect
But
at
this
point
he
began
to
stammer
and
so
lost
his
head
as
to
sit
down
upon
his
own
hat
No
one
bade
him
depart
however
and
Anna
Sergievna
even
went
so
far
as
to
present
him
to
her
aunt
and
sister
Accordingly
it
was
not
long
before
he
recovered
his
equanimity
and
shone
forth
with
his
accustomed
brilliancy
Often
the
appearance
of
the
paltry
represents
a
convenient
phenomenon
in
life
since
it
relaxes
over-taut
strings
and
sobers
natures
prone
to
conceit
and
self-assurance
by
reminding
them
of
their
kinship
with
the
newcomer
Thus
Sitnikov
's
arrival
caused
everything
to
become
duller
and
a
trifle
more
futile
but
also
rendered
things
simpler
and
enabled
the
company
to
partake
of
supper
with
a
better
appetite
and
to
part
for
the
night
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
Let
me
recall
to
you
some
words
of
your
own
said
Arkady
when
he
had
got
into
bed
and
Bazarov
was
still
undressing
I
refer
to
the
words
'Why
are
you
down-hearted
Have
you
just
fulfilled
a
sacred
duty
Between
the
two
there
had
become
established
those
half-quizzical
relations
which
are
always
a
sign
of
tacit
distrust
and
a
smouldering
grudge
To-morrow
I
intend
to
set
out
for
my
father
's
place
remarked
Bazarov
in
disregard
of
what
Arkady
had
said
The
latter
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
Though
surprised
he
also
for
some
reason
felt
glad
Ah
he
exclaimed
Then
that
is
why
you
are
down-hearted
Bazarov
yawned
When
you
are
come
to
be
a
little
older
he
replied
you
will
know
more
And
what
of
Anna
Sergievna
continued
Arkady
Well
What
of
her
Is
it
likely
that
she
will
let
you
go
I
am
not
her
hireling
Arkady
relapsed
into
thought
and
Bazarov
sought
his
bed
and
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
For
a
few
moments
silence
reigned
Evgenii
said
Arkady
suddenly
Yes
I
too
intend
to
leave
to-morrow
Bazarov
made
no
reply
True
I
shall
be
returning
to
Marino
continued
Arkady
but
we
might
bear
one
another
company
as
far
as
Khokhlovskïe
Viselki
and
there
you
could
hire
horses
of
Thedot
Of
course
I
should
have
been
delighted
to
make
your
family
's
acquaintance
but
were
I
to
accompany
you
I
might
act
as
a
source
of
constraint
upon
them
and
yourself
alike
You
