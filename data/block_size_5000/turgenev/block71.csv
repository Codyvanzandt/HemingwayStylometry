how
he
has
dared
to
annoy
you
I
tell
you
again
that
I
do
not
ask
that
And
what
can
induce
you
devant
les
domestiques
Anna
Vassilyevna
flushed
a
little
You
need
not
say
that
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
I
never
devant
les
domestiques
Fedushka
go
and
see
you
bring
Pavel
Yakovlitch
here
at
once
The
little
page
went
off
And
that
s
absolutely
unnecessary
muttered
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
between
his
teeth
and
he
began
again
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
I
did
not
bring
up
the
subject
with
that
object
Good
Heavens
Paul
must
apologise
to
you
Good
Heavens
what
are
his
apologies
to
me
And
what
do
you
mean
by
apologies
That
s
all
words
Why
he
must
be
corrected
Well
you
can
correct
him
yourself
He
will
listen
to
you
sooner
than
to
me
For
my
part
I
bear
him
no
grudge
No
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
you
ve
not
been
yourself
ever
since
you
arrived
You
have
even
to
my
eyes
grown
thinner
lately
I
am
afraid
your
treatment
is
doing
you
no
good
The
treatment
is
quite
indispensable
observed
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
my
liver
is
affected
At
that
instant
Shubin
came
in
He
looked
tired
A
slight
almost
ironical
smile
played
on
his
lips
You
asked
for
me
Anna
Vassilyevna
he
observed
Yes
certainly
I
asked
for
you
Really
Paul
this
is
dreadful
I
am
very
much
displeased
with
you
How
could
you
be
wanting
in
respect
to
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
has
complained
of
me
to
you
inquired
Shubin
and
with
the
same
smile
on
his
lips
he
looked
at
Stahov
The
latter
turned
away
dropping
his
eyes
Yes
he
complains
of
you
I
don
t
know
what
you
have
done
amiss
but
you
ought
to
apologise
at
once
because
his
health
is
very
much
deranged
just
now
and
indeed
we
all
ought
when
we
are
young
to
treat
our
benefactors
with
respect
Ah
what
logic
thought
Shubin
and
he
turned
to
Stahov
I
am
ready
to
apologise
to
you
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
he
said
with
a
polite
half-bow
if
I
have
really
offended
you
in
any
way
I
did
not
at
all
with
that
idea
rejoined
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
still
as
before
avoiding
Shubin
s
eyes
However
I
will
readily
forgive
you
for
as
you
know
I
am
not
an
exacting
person
Oh
that
admits
of
no
doubt
said
Shubin
But
allow
me
to
be
inquisitive
is
Anna
Vassilyevna
aware
precisely
what
constituted
my
offence
No
I
know
nothing
observed
Anna
Vassilyevna
craning
forward
her
head
expectantly
O
Good
Lord
exclaimed
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
hurriedly
how
often
have
I
prayed
and
besought
how
often
have
I
said
how
I
hate
these
scenes
and
explanations
When
one
s
been
away
an
age
and
comes
home
hoping
for
rest
talk
of
the
family
circle
interieur
being
a
family
man
and
here
one
finds
scenes
and
unpleasantnesses
There
s
not
a
minute
of
peace
One
s
positively
driven
to
the
club
or
or
elsewhere
A
man
is
alive
he
has
a
physical
side
and
it
has
its
claims
but
here
And
without
concluding
his
sentence
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
went
quickly
out
slamming
the
door
Anna
Vassilyevna
looked
after
him
To
the
club
she
muttered
bitterly
you
are
not
going
to
the
club
profligate
You
ve
no
one
at
the
club
to
give
away
my
horses
to
horses
from
my
own
stable
and
the
grey
ones
too
My
favourite
colour
Yes
yes
fickle-hearted
man
she
went
on
raising
her
voice
you
are
not
going
to
the
club
As
for
you
Paul
she
pursued
getting
up
I
wonder
you
re
not
ashamed
I
should
have
thought
you
would
not
be
so
childish
And
now
my
head
has
begun
to
ache
Where
is
Zoya
do
you
know
I
think
she
s
upstairs
in
her
room
The
wise
little
fox
always
hides
in
her
hole
when
there
s
a
storm
in
the
air
Come
please
please
Anna
Vassilyevna
began
searching
about
her
Haven
t
you
seen
my
little
glass
of
grated
horse-radish
Paul
be
so
good
as
not
to
make
me
angry
for
the
future
How
make
you
angry
auntie
Give
me
your
little
hand
to
kiss
Your
horse-radish
I
saw
on
the
little
table
in
the
boudoir
Darya
always
leaves
it
about
somewhere
said
Anna
Vassilyevna
and
she
walked
away
with
a
rustle
of
silk
skirts
Shubin
was
about
to
follow
her
but
he
stopped
on
hearing
Uvar
Ivanovitch
s
drawling
voice
behind
him
I
would
have
given
it
you
young
puppy
the
retired
cornet
brought
out
in
gasps
Shubin
went
up
to
him
And
what
have
I
done
then
most
venerable
Uvar
Ivanovitch
How
you
are
young
be
respectful
Yes
indeed
Respectful
to
whom
To
whom
You
know
whom
Ay
grin
away
Shubin
crossed
his
arms
on
his
breast
Ah
you
type
of
the
choice
element
in
drama
he
exclaimed
you
primeval
force
of
the
black
earth
cornerstone
of
the
social
fabric
Uvar
Ivanovitch
s
fingers
began
to
work
There
there
my
boy
don
t
provoke
me
Here
pursued
Shubin
is
a
gentleman
not
young
to
judge
by
appearances
but
what
blissful
child-like
faith
is
still
hidden
in
him
Respect
And
do
you
know
you
primitive
creature
what
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
was
in
a
rage
with
me
for
Why
I
spent
the
whole
of
this
morning
with
him
at
his
German
woman
s
we
were
singing
the
three
of
us
Do
not
leave
me
You
should
have
heard
us
that
would
have
moved
you
We
sang
and
sang
my
dear
sir
and
well
I
got
bored
I
could
see
something
was
wrong
there
was
an
alarming
tenderness
in
the
air
And
I
began
to
tease
them
both
I
was
very
successful
First
she
was
angry
with
me
then
with
him
and
then
he
got
angry
with
her
and
told
her
that
he
was
never
happy
except
at
home
and
he
had
a
paradise
there
and
she
told
him
he
had
no
morals
and
I
murmured
Ach
to
her
in
German
He
walked
off
and
I
stayed
behind
he
came
here
to
his
paradise
that
s
to
say
and
he
was
soon
sick
of
paradise
so
he
set
to
grumbling
Well
now
who
do
you
consider
was
to
blame
You
of
course
replied
Uvar
Ivanovitch
Shubin
stared
at
him
May
I
venture
to
ask
you
most
reverend
knight-errant
he
began
in
an
obsequious
voice
these
enigmatical
words
you
have
deigned
to
utter
as
the
result
of
some
exercise
of
your
reflecting
faculties
or
under
the
influence
of
a
momentary
necessity
to
start
the
vibration
in
the
air
known
as
sound
Don
t
tempt
me
I
tell
you
groaned
Uvar
Ivanovitch
Shubin
laughed
and
ran
away
Hi
shouted
Uvar
Ivanovitch
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
you
there
a
glass
of
spirits
A
little
page
brought
the
glass
of
spirits
and
some
salt
fish
on
a
tray
Uvar
Ivanovitch
slowly
took
the
glass
from
the
tray
and
gazed
a
long
while
with
intense
attention
at
it
as
though
he
could
not
quite
understand
what
it
was
he
had
in
his
hand
Then
he
looked
at
the
page
and
asked
him
Wasn
t
his
name
Vaska
Then
he
assumed
an
air
of
resignation
drank
off
the
spirit
munched
the
herring
and
was
slowly
proceeding
to
get
his
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
But
the
page
had
long
ago
carried
off
and
put
away
the
tray
and
the
decanter
eaten
up
the
remains
of
the
herring
and
had
time
to
go
off
to
sleep
curled
up
in
a
great-coat
of
his
master
s
while
Uvar
Ivanovitch
still
continued
to
hold
the
handkerchief
before
him
in
his
opened
fingers
and
with
the
same
intense
attention
gazed
now
at
the
window
now
at
the
floor
and
walls
Shubin
went
back
to
his
room
in
the
lodge
and
was
just
opening
a
book
when
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
s
valet
came
cautiously
into
his
room
and
handed
him
a
small
triangular
note
sealed
with
a
thick
heraldic
crest
I
hope
he
found
in
the
note
that
you
as
a
man
of
honour
will
not
allow
yourself
to
hint
by
so
much
as
a
single
word
at
a
certain
promissory
note
which
was
talked
of
this
morning
You
are
acquainted
with
my
position
and
my
rules
the
insignificance
of
the
sum
in
itself
and
the
other
circumstances
there
are
in
fine
family
secrets
which
must
be
respected
and
family
tranquillity
is
something
so
sacred
that
only
etres
sans
cour
among
whom
I
have
no
reason
to
reckon
you
would
repudiate
it
Give
this
note
back
to
me
N
S
Shubin
scribbled
below
in
pencil
Don
t
excite
yourself
I
m
not
quite
a
sneak
yet
and
gave
the
note
back
to
the
man
and
again
began
upon
the
book
But
it
soon
slipped
out
of
his
hands
He
looked
at
the
reddening-sky
at
the
two
mighty
young
pines
standing
apart
from
the
other
trees
thought
by
day
pines
are
bluish
but
how
magnificently
green
they
are
in
the
evening
and
went
out
into
the
garden
in
the
secret
hope
of
meeting
Elena
there
He
was
not
mistaken
Before
him
on
a
path
between
the
bushes
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
dress
He
went
after
her
and
when
he
was
abreast
with
her
remarked
Don
t
look
in
my
direction
I
m
not
worth
it
She
gave
him
a
cursory
glance
smiled
cursorily
and
walked
on
further
into
the
depths
of
the
garden
Shubin
went
after
her
I
beg
you
not
to
look
at
me
he
began
and
then
I
address
you
flagrant
contradiction
But
what
of
that
it
s
not
the
first
time
I
ve
contradicted
myself
I
have
just
recollected
that
I
have
never
begged
your
pardon
as
I
ought
for
my
stupid
behaviour
yesterday
You
are
not
angry
with
me
Elena
Nikolaevna
are
you
She
stood
still
and
did
not
answer
him
at
once
not
because
she
was
angry
but
because
her
thoughts
were
far
away
No
she
said
at
last
I
am
not
in
the
least
angry
Shubin
bit
his
lip
What
an
absorbed
and
what
an
indifferent
face
he
muttered
Elena
Nikolaevna
he
continued
raising
his
voice
allow
me
to
tell
you
a
little
anecdote
I
had
a
friend
and
this
friend
also
had
a
friend
who
at
first
conducted
himself
as
befits
a
gentleman
but
afterwards
took
to
drink
So
one
day
early
in
the
morning
my
friend
meets
him
in
the
street
and
by
that
time
note
the
acquaintance
has
been
completely
dropped
meets
him
and
sees
he
is
drunk
My
friend
went
and
turned
his
back
on
him
But
he
ran
up
and
said
I
would
not
be
angry
says
he
if
you
refused
to
recognise
me
but
why
should
you
turn
your
back
on
me
Perhaps
I
have
been
brought
to
this
through
grief
Peace
to
my
ashes
Shubin
paused
And
is
that
all
inquired
Elena
Yes
that
s
all
I
don
t
understand
you
What
are
you
hinting
at
You
told
me
just
now
not
to
look
your
way
Yes
and
now
I
have
told
you
that
it
s
too
bad
to
turn
your
back
on
me
But
did
I
began
Elena
Did
you
not
Elena
flushed
slightly
and
held
out
her
hand
to
Shubin
He
pressed
it
warmly
Here
you
seem
to
have
convicted
me
of
a
bad
feeling
said
Elena
but
your
suspicion
is
unjust
I
was
not
even
thinking
of
Avoiding
you
Granted
granted
But
you
must
acknowledge
that
at
that
minute
you
had
a
thousand
ideas
in
your
head
of
which
you
would
not
confide
one
to
me
Eh
I
ve
spoken
the
truth
I
m
quite
sure
Perhaps
so
And
why
is
it
why
My
ideas
are
not
clear
to
myself
said
Elena
Then
it
s
just
the
time
for
confiding
them
to
some
one
else
put
in
Shubin
But
I
will
tell
you
what
it
really
is
You
have
a
bad
opinion
of
me
I
Yes
you
you
imagine
that
everything
in
me
is
half-humbug
because
I
am
an
artist
that
I
am
incapable
not
only
of
doing
anything
in
that
you
are
very
likely
right
but
even
of
any
genuine
deep
feeling
you
think
that
I
am
not
capable
even
of
weeping
sincerely
that
I
m
a
gossip
and
a
slanderer
and
all
because
I
m
an
artist
What
luckless
God-forsaken
wretches
we
artists
are
after
that
You
for
instance
I
am
ready
to
adore
and
you
don
t
believe
in
my
repentance
No
Pavel
Yakovlitch
I
believe
in
your
repentance
and
I
believe
in
your
tears
But
it
seems
to
me
that
even
your
repentance
amuses
you
yes
and
your
tears
too
Shubin
shuddered
Well
I
see
this
is
as
the
doctors
say
a
hopeless
case
casus
incurabilis
There
is
nothing
left
but
to
bow
the
head
and
submit
And
meanwhile
good
Heavens
can
it
be
true
can
I
possibly
be
absorbed
in
my
own
egoism
when
there
is
a
soul
like
this
living
at
my
side
And
to
know
that
one
will
never
penetrate
into
that
soul
never
will
know
why
it
grieves
and
why
it
rejoices
what
is
working
within
it
what
it
desires
whither
it
is
going
Tell
me
he
said
after
a
short
silence
could
you
never
under
any
circumstances
love
an
artist
Elena
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
I
don
t
think
so
Pavel
Yakovlitch
no
Which
was
to
be
proved
said
Shubin
with
comical
dejection
After
which
I
suppose
it
would
be
more
seemly
for
me
not
to
intrude
on
your
solitary
walk
A
professor
would
ask
you
on
what
data
you
founded
your
answer
no
I
m
not
a
professor
though
but
a
baby
according
to
your
ideas
but
one
does
not
turn
one
s
back
on
a
baby
remember
Good-bye
Peace
to
my
ashes
Elena
was
on
the
point
of
stopping
him
but
after
a
moment
s
thought
she
too
said
Good-bye
Shubin
went
out
of
the
courtyard
At
a
short
distance
from
the
Stahov
s
house
he
was
met
by
Bersenyev
He
was
walking
with
hurried
steps
his
head
bent
and
his
hat
pushed
back
on
his
neck
Andrei
Petrovitch
cried
Shubin
He
stopped
Go
on
go
on
continued
Shubin
I
only
shouted
I
won
t
detain
you
and
you
d
better
slip
straight
into
the
garden
you
ll
find
Elena
there
I
fancy
she
s
waiting
for
you
she
s
waiting
for
some
one
anyway
Do
you
understand
the
force
of
those
words
she
is
waiting
And
do
you
know
my
dear
boy
an
astonishing
circumstance
Imagine
it
s
two
years
now
that
I
have
been
living
in
the
same
house
with
her
I
m
in
love
with
her
and
it
s
only
just
now
this
minute
that
I
ve
not
understood
but
really
seen
her
I
have
seen
her
and
I
lifted
up
my
hands
in
amazement
Don
t
look
at
me
please
with
that
sham
sarcastic
smile
which
does
not
suit
your
sober
features
Well
now
I
suppose
you
want
to
remind
me
of
Annushka
What
of
it
I
don
t
deny
it
Annushkas
are
on
my
poor
level
And
long
life
to
all
Annushkas
and
Zoyas
and
even
Augustina
Christianovnas
You
go
to
Elena
now
and
I
will
make
my
way
to
Annushka
you
fancy
No
my
dear
fellow
worse
than
that
to
Prince
Tchikurasov
He
is
a
Maecenas
of
a
Kazan-Tartar
stock
after
the
style
of
Volgin
Do
you
see
this
note
of
invitation
these
letters
R.S.V.P
Even
in
the
country
there
s
no
peace
for
me
Addio
Bersenyev
listened
to
Shubin
s
tirade
in
silence
looking
as
though
he
were
just
a
little
ashamed
of
him
Then
he
went
into
the
courtyard
of
the
Stahovs
house
And
Shubin
did
really
go
to
Prince
Tchikurasov
to
whom
with
the
most
cordial
air
he
began
saying
the
most
insulting
things
The
Maecenas
of
the
Tartars
of
Kazan
chuckled
the
Maecenas
s
guests
laughed
but
no
one
felt
merry
and
every
one
was
in
a
bad
temper
when
the
party
broke
up
So
two
gentlemen
slightly
acquainted
may
be
seen
when
they
meet
on
the
Nevsky
Prospect
suddenly
grinning
at
one
another
and
pursing
up
their
eyes
and
noses
and
cheeks
and
then
directly
they
have
passed
one
another
they
resume
their
former
indifferent
often
cross
and
generally
sickly
expression
Elena
met
Bersenyev
cordially
though
not
in
the
garden
but
the
drawing-room
and
at
once
almost
impatiently
renewed
the
conversation
of
the
previous
day
She
was
alone
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
had
quietly
slipped
away
Anna
Vassilyevna
was
lying
down
upstairs
with
a
wet
bandage
on
her
head
Zoya
was
sitting
by
her
the
folds
of
her
skirt
arranged
precisely
about
her
and
her
little
hands
clasped
on
her
knees
Uvar
Ivanovitch
was
reposing
in
the
attic
on
a
wide
and
comfortable
divan
known
as
a
samo-son
or
dozer
Bersenyev
again
mentioned
his
father
he
held
his
memory
sacred
Let
us
too
say
a
few
words
about
him
The
owner
of
eighty-two
serfs
whom
he
set
free
before
his
death
an
old
Gottingen
student
and
disciple
of
the
Illuminati
the
author
of
a
manuscript
work
on
transformations
or
typifications
of
the
spirit
in
the
world
a
work
in
which
Schelling
s
philosophy
Swedenborgianism
and
republicanism
were
mingled
in
the
most
original
fashion
Bersenyev
s
father
brought
him
while
still
a
boy
to
Moscow
immediately
after
his
mother
s
death
and
at
once
himself
undertook
his
education
He
prepared
himself
for
each
lesson
exerted
himself
with
extraordinary
conscientiousness
and
absolute
lack
of
success
he
was
a
dreamer
a
bookworm
and
a
mystic
he
spoke
in
a
dull
hesitating
voice
used
obscure
and
roundabout
expressions
metaphorical
by
preference
and
was
shy
even
of
his
son
whom
he
loved
passionately
It
was
not
surprising
that
his
son
was
simply
bewildered
at
his
lessons
and
did
not
advance
in
the
least
The
old
man
he
was
almost
fifty
he
had
married
late
in
life
surmised
at
last
that
things
were
not
going
quite
right
and
he
placed
his
Andrei
in
a
school
Andrei
began
to
learn
but
he
was
not
removed
from
his
father
s
supervision
his
father
visited
him
unceasingly
wearying
the
schoolmaster
to
death
with
his
instructions
and
conversation
the
teachers
too
were
bored
by
his
uninvited
visits
he
was
for
ever
bringing
them
some
as
they
said
far-fetched
books
on
education
Even
the
schoolboys
were
embarrassed
at
the
sight
of
the
old
man
s
swarthy
pockmarked
face
his
lank
figure
invariably
clothed
in
a
sort
of
scanty
grey
dresscoat
The
boys
did
not
suspect
then
that
this
grim
unsmiling
old
gentleman
with
his
crane-like
gait
and
his
long
nose
was
at
heart
troubling
and
yearning
over
each
one
of
them
almost
as
over
his
own
son
He
once
conceived
the
idea
of
talking
to
them
about
Washington
My
young
nurslings
he
began
but
at
the
first
sounds
of
his
strange
voice
the
young
nurslings
ran
away
The
good
old
Gottingen
student
did
not
lie
on
a
bed
of
roses
he
was
for
ever
weighed
down
by
the
march
of
history
by
questions
and
ideas
of
every
kind
When
young
Bersenyev
entered
the
university
his
father
used
to
drive
with
him
to
the
lectures
but
his
health
was
already
beginning
to
break
up
The
events
of
the
year
1848
shook
him
to
the
foundation
it
necessitated
the
re-writing
of
his
whole
book
and
he
died
in
the
winter
of
1853
before
his
son
s
time
at
the
university
was
over
but
he
was
able
beforehand
to
congratulate
him
on
his
degree
and
to
consecrate
him
to
the
service
of
science
I
pass
on
the
torch
to
you
he
said
to
him
two
hours
before
his
death
I
held
it
while
I
could
you
too
must
not
let
the
light
grow
dim
before
the
end
Bersenyev
talked
a
long
while
to
Elena
of
his
father
The
embarrassment
he
had
felt
in
her
presence
disappeared
and
his
lisp
was
less
marked
The
conversation
passed
on
to
the
university
Tell
me
Elena
asked
him
were
there
any
remarkable
men
among
your
comrades
Bersenyev
was
again
reminded
of
Shubin
s
words
No
Elena
Nikolaevna
to
tell
you
the
truth
there
was
not
a
single
remarkable
man
among
us
And
indeed
where
are
such
to
be
found
There
was
they
say
a
good
time
once
in
the
Moscow
university
But
not
now
Now
it
s
a
school
not
a
university
I
was
not
happy
with
my
comrades
he
added
dropping
his
voice
Not
happy
murmured
Elena
But
I
ought
continued
Bersenyev
to
make
an
exception
I
know
one
student
it
s
true
he
is
not
in
the
same
faculty
he
is
certainly
a
remarkable
man
What
is
his
name
Elena
inquired
with
interest
Insarov
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
He
is
a
Bulgarian
Not
a
Russian
No
he
is
not
a
Russian
Why
is
he
living
in
Moscow
then
He
came
here
to
study
And
do
you
know
with
what
aim
he
is
studying
He
has
a
single
idea
the
liberation
of
his
country
And
his
story
is
an
exceptional
one
His
father
was
a
fairly
well-to-do
merchant
he
came
from
Tirnova
Tirnova
is
now
a
small
town
but
it
was
the
capital
of
Bulgaria
in
the
old
days
when
Bulgaria
was
still
an
independent
state
He
traded
with
Sophia
and
had
relations
with
Russia
his
sister
Insarov
s
aunt
is
still
living
in
Kiev
married
to
a
senior
history
teacher
in
the
gymnasium
there
In
1835
that
is
to
say
eighteen
years
ago
a
terrible
crime
was
committed
Insarov
s
mother
suddenly
disappeared
without
leaving
a
trace
behind
a
week
later
she
was
found
murdered
Elena
shuddered
Bersenyev
stopped
Go
on
go
on
she
said
There
were
rumours
that
she
had
been
outraged
and
murdered
by
a
Turkish
aga
her
husband
Insarov
s
father
found
out
the
truth
tried
to
avenge
her
but
only
succeeded
in
wounding
the
aga
with
his
poniard
He
was
shot
Shot
and
without
a
trial
Yes
Insarov
was
just
eight
years
old
at
the
time
He
remained
in
the
hands
of
neighbours
The
sister
heard
of
the
fate
of
her
brother
s
family
and
wanted
to
take
the
nephew
to
live
with
her
They
got
him
to
Odessa
and
from
there
to
Kiev
At
Kiev
he
lived
twelve
whole
years
That
s
how
it
is
he
speaks
Russian
so
well
He
speaks
Russian
Just
as
we
do
When
he
was
twenty
that
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
1848
he
began
to
want
to
return
to
his
country
He
stayed
in
Sophia
and
Tirnova
and
travelled
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
Bulgaria
spending
two
years
there
and
learning
his
mother
tongue
over
again
The
Turkish
Government
persecuted
him
and
he
was
certainly
exposed
to
great
dangers
during
those
two
years
I
once
caught
sight
of
a
broad
scar
on
his
neck
from
a
wound
no
doubt
but
he
does
not
like
to
talk
about
it
He
is
reserved
too
in
his
own
way
I
have
tried
to
question
him
about
everything
but
I
could
get
nothing
out
of
him
He
answers
by
generalities
He
s
awfully
obstinate
He
returned
to
Russia
again
in
1850
to
Moscow
with
the
intention
of
educating
himself
thoroughly
getting
intimate
with
Russians
and
then
when
he
leaves
the
university
What
then
broke
in
Elena
What
God
wills
It
s
hard
to
forecast
the
future
For
a
while
Elena
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
Bersenyev
You
have
greatly
interested
me
by
what
you
have
told
me
she
said
What
is
he
like
this
friend
of
yours
what
did
you
call
him
Insarov
What
shall
I
say
To
my
mind
he
s
good-looking
But
you
will
see
him
for
yourself
How
so
I
will
bring
him
here
to
see
you
He
is
coming
to
our
little
village
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
is
going
to
live
with
me
in
the
same
lodging
Really
But
will
he
care
to
come
to
see
us
I
should
think
so
He
will
be
delighted
He
isn
t
proud
then
Not
the
least
That
s
to
say
he
is
proud
if
you
like
only
not
in
the
sense
you
mean
He
will
never
for
instance
borrow
money
from
any
one
Is
he
poor
Yes
he
isn
t
rich
When
he
went
to
Bulgaria
he
collected
some
relics
left
of
his
father
s
property
and
his
aunt
helps
him
but
it
all
comes
to
very
little
He
must
have
a
great
deal
of
character
observed
Elena
Yes
He
is
a
man
of
iron
And
at
the
same
time
you
will
see
there
is
something
childlike
and
frank
with
all
his
concentration
and
even
his
reserve
It
s
true
his
frankness
is
not
our
poor
sort
of
frankness
the
frankness
of
people
who
have
absolutely
nothing
to
conceal
But
there
I
will
bring
him
to
see
you
wait
a
little
And
isn
t
he
shy
asked
Elena
again
No
he
s
not
shy
It
s
only
vain
people
who
are
shy
Why
are
you
vain
He
was
confused
and
made
a
vague
gesture
with
his
hands
You
excite
my
curiosity
pursued
Elena
But
tell
me
has
he
not
taken
vengeance
on
that
Turkish
aga
Bersenyev
smiled
Revenge
is
only
to
be
found
in
novels
Elena
Nikolaevna
and
besides
in
twelve
years
that
aga
may
well
be
dead
Mr
Insarov
has
never
said
anything
though
to
you
about
it
No
never
Why
did
he
go
to
Sophia
His
father
used
to
live
there
Elena
grew
thoughtful
To
liberate
one
s
country
she
said
It
is
terrible
even
to
utter
those
words
they
are
so
grand
At
that
instant
Anna
Vassilyevna
came
into
the
room
and
the
conversation
stopped
Bersenyev
was
stirred
by
strange
emotions
when
he
returned
home
that
evening
He
did
not
regret
his
plan
of
making
Elena
acquainted
with
Insarov
he
felt
the
deep
impression
made
on
her
by
his
account
of
the
young
Bulgarian
very
natural
had
he
not
himself
tried
to
deepen
that
impression
But
a
vague
unfathomable
emotion
lurked
secretly
in
his
heart
he
was
sad
with
a
sadness
that
had
nothing
noble
in
it
This
sadness
did
not
prevent
him
however
from
setting
to
work
on
the
History
of
the
Hohenstaufen
and
beginning
to
read
it
at
the
very
page
at
which
he
had
left
off
the
evening
before
Two
days
later
Insarov
in
accordance
with
his
promise
arrived
at
Bersenyev
s
with
his
luggage
He
had
no
servant
but
without
any
assistance
he
put
his
room
to
rights
arranged
the
furniture
dusted
and
swept
the
floor
He
had
special
trouble
with
the
writing
table
which
would
not
fit
into
the
recess
in
the
wall
assigned
for
it
but
Insarov
with
the
silent
persistence
peculiar
to
him
succeeded
in
getting
his
own
way
with
it
When
he
had
settled
in
he
asked
Bersenyev
to
let
him
pay
him
ten
roubles
in
advance
and
arming
himself
with
a
thick
stick
set
off
to
inspect
the
country
surrounding
his
new
abode
He
returned
three
hours
later
and
in
response
to
Bersenyev
s
invitation
to
share
his
repast
he
said
that
he
would
not
refuse
to
dine
with
him
that
day
but
that
he
had
already
spoken
to
the
woman
of
the
house
and
would
get
her
to
send
him
up
his
meals
for
the
future
Upon
my
word
said
Bersenyev
you
will
fare
very
badly
that
old
body
can
t
cook
a
bit
Why
don
t
you
dine
with
me
we
would
go
halves
over
the
cost
My
means
don
t
allow
me
to
dine
as
you
do
Insarov
replied
with
a
tranquil
smile
There
was
something
in
that
smile
which
forbade
further
insistence
Bersenyev
did
not
add
a
word
After
dinner
he
proposed
to
Insarov
that
he
should
take
him
to
the
Stahovs
but
he
replied
that
he
had
intended
to
devote
the
evening
to
correspondence
with
his
Bulgarians
and
so
he
would
ask
him
to
put
off
the
visit
to
the
Stahovs
till
next
day
Bersenyev
was
already
familiar
with
Insarov
s
unbending
will
but
it
was
only
now
when
he
was
under
the
same
roof
with
him
that
he
fully
realised
at
last
that
Insarov
would
never
alter
any
decision
just
in
the
same
way
as
he
would
never
fail
to
carry
out
a
promise
he
had
given
to
Bersenyev
a
Russian
to
his
fingertips
this
more
than
German
exactitude
seemed
at
first
odd
and
even
rather
ludicrous
but
he
soon
got
used
to
it
and
ended
by
finding
it
if
not
deserving
of
respect
at
least
very
convenient
The
second
day
after
his
arrival
Insarov
got
up
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
made
a
round
of
almost
all
Kuntsovo
bathed
in
the
river
drank
a
glass
of
cold
milk
and
then
set
to
work
And
he
had
plenty
of
work
to
do
he
was
studying
Russian
history
and
law
and
political
economy
translating
the
Bulgarian
ballads
and
chronicles
collecting
materials
on
the
Eastern
Question
and
compiling
a
Russian
grammar
for
the
use
of
Bulgarians
and
a
Bulgarian
grammar
for
the
use
of
Russians
Bersenyev
went
up
to
him
and
began
to
discuss
Feuerbach
Insarov
listened
attentively
made
few
remarks
but
to
the
point
it
was
clear
from
his
observations
that
he
was
trying
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
as
to
whether
he
need
study
Feuerbach
or
whether
he
could
get
on
without
him
Bersenyev
turned
the
conversation
on
to
his
pursuits
and
asked
him
if
he
could
not
show
him
anything
Insarov
read
him
his
translation
of
two
or
three
Bulgarian
ballads
and
was
anxious
to
hear
his
opinion
of
them
Bersenyev
thought
the
translation
a
faithful
one
but
not
sufficiently
spirited
Insarov
paid
close
attention
to
his
criticism
From
the
ballads
Bersenyev
passed
on
to
the
present
position
of
Bulgaria
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
what
a
change
came
over
Insarov
at
the
mere
mention
of
his
country
not
that
his
face
flushed
nor
his
voice
grew
louder
no
but
at
once
a
sense
of
force
and
intense
onward
striving
was
expressed
