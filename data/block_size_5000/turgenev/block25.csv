would
it
be
if
we
were
to
tell
him
that
we
fell
out
over
politics
Capital
agreed
Bazarov
Tell
him
for
instance
that
I
started
cursing
Anglomaniacs
A
good
idea
But
what
can
that
man
be
thinking
of
us
I
can
not
imagine
The
speaker
pointed
to
the
same
peasant
who
shortly
before
the
duel
had
driven
a
pair
of
loose
horses
past
Bazarov
and
was
now
shuffling
homewards
while
doffing
his
cap
at
the
sight
of
the
gentlemen
Who
can
say
replied
Bazarov
Probably
he
is
thinking
of
nothing
at
all
As
Madame
Radcliffe
1
frequently
reminds
us
the
Russian
muzhik
is
an
unknown
quantity
Does
any
one
understand
him
He
does
not
even
understand
himself
There
you
go
again
began
Paul
Petrovitch
but
suddenly
broke
off
to
say
in
a
still
louder
tone
See
what
that
fool
Peter
has
done
Here
comes
my
brother
himself
Sure
enough
on
turning
his
head
Bazarov
saw
Nikolai
Petrovitch
's
pale
face
peering
from
the
drozhki
Nor
had
the
vehicle
come
to
a
halt
before
Nikolai
had
sprung
from
the
step
and
rushed
towards
his
brother
What
is
this
he
cried
in
agitated
accents
Evgenii
Vasilitch
I
beg
of
you
to
tell
me
what
has
happened
Nothing
has
happened
replied
Paul
Petrovitch
in
Bazarov
's
stead
You
are
disturbing
yourself
to
no
purpose
I
had
a
small
quarrel
with
Monsieur
Bazarov
and
have
paid
a
penalty
as
small
But
whence
did
it
arise
For
God
's
sake
tell
me
What
is
there
to
say
It
arose
from
the
fact
that
Monsieur
Bazarov
spoke
in
disrespectful
terms
of
Sir
Robert
Peel
I
would
hasten
to
add
that
throughout
I
alone
was
at
fault
and
that
Monsieur
Bazarov
bore
himself
admirably
I
being
the
challenger
But
look
at
the
blood
Pshaw
Did
you
suppose
my
veins
to
run
with
water
As
a
matter
of
fact
the
blood-letting
will
do
me
good
Is
not
that
so
doctor
Help
me
to
mount
the
drozhki
and
away
with
melancholy
By
to-morrow
I
shall
be
recovered
Splendid
That
is
the
way
to
do
it
Right
away
coachman
When
on
the
point
of
starting
homewards
in
the
wake
of
the
drozhki
Nikolai
Petrovitch
perceived
Bazarov
to
be
for
remaining
behind
Evgenii
Vasilitch
he
said
I
would
beg
of
you
to
attend
my
brother
until
a
doctor
can
be
procured
from
the
town
Bazarov
nodded
in
silence
An
hour
later
Paul
Petrovitch
was
reposing
in
bed
with
his
leg
neatly
and
artistically
bandaged
The
whole
house
was
in
a
turmoil
Thenichka
greatly
upset
and
Nikolai
able
to
do
nothing
but
wring
his
hands
The
sick
man
on
the
contrary
laughed
and
jested
especially
with
Bazarov
and
to
meet
the
occasion
had
donned
a
fine
linen
shirt
an
elegant
morning
jacket
and
a
Turkish
fez
Lastly
he
forbade
any
one
to
close
the
shutters
and
kept
venting
humorous
protests
against
the
necessity
of
abstaining
from
food
Towards
nightfall
however
fever
supervened
and
his
head
began
to
ache
with
the
result
that
when
the
doctor
arrived
from
the
town
Nikolai
Petrovitch
had
disobeyed
his
brother
in
this
respect
and
Bazarov
also
had
consented
to
his
doing
so
in
that
after
paying
the
patient
a
single
visit
and
that
a
very
brief
one
and
being
put
to
the
mortification
of
having
to
avoid
Thenichka
on
two
occasions
when
he
met
her
he
had
felt
that
he
preferred
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
loneliness
bitterness
and
rancour
when
the
doctor
arrived
from
the
town
he
advised
a
cooling
draught
but
at
the
same
time
confirmed
Bazarov
's
opinion
that
no
danger
was
to
be
apprehended
In
passing
it
may
also
be
mentioned
that
on
being
informed
by
Nikolai
Petrovitch
that
Paul
Petrovitch
's
wound
had
been
self-inflicted
through
an
accident
the
said
doctor
replied
H
'm
to
which
on
receiving
into
his
hand
a
fee
of
twenty-five
roubles
he
added
that
of
course
things
of
the
kind
often
occurred
No
one
in
the
house
that
night
retired
to
bed
or
even
undressed
but
at
intervals
Nikolai
Petrovitch
would
tiptoe
into
his
brother's
room
and
as
silently
withdraw
At
intervals
too
Paul
Petrovitch
would
awake
from
a
doze
sigh
faintly
and
say
to
Nikolai
either
Couchez-vous
or
Please
give
me
a
drink
But
once
it
happened
that
Nikolai
sent
the
invalid
a
glass
of
lemonade
by
the
hand
of
Thenichka
and
this
time
Paul
Petrovitch
scanned
her
long
and
searchingly
before
draining
the
tumbler
to
the
dregs
Towards
morning
the
fever
increased
a
little
and
a
trace
of
lightheadedness
made
its
appearance
which
for
a
while
caused
the
patient
only
to
utter
disconnected
words
But
suddenly
he
opened
his
eyes
and
on
seeing
his
brother
bending
solicitously
over
the
bed
murmured
Nikolai
do
not
you
think
that
Thenichka
slightly
resembles
Nelly
What
Nelly
Paul
Who
is
Nelly
How
can
you
ask
The
Princess
R
of
course
In
the
upper
portion
of
the
face
especially
Thenichka
resembles
her
C'est
de
la
même
famille
Nikolai
Petrovitch
made
no
reply
He
could
only
remain
lost
in
wonder
that
bygone
fancies
could
so
survive
in
the
human
consciousness
That
this
should
have
cropped
up
again
he
reflected
On
another
occasion
Paul
Petrovitch
muttered
as
he
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
How
I
love
this
idle
existence
And
again
a
few
minutes
later
he
whispered
I
will
not
allow
a
single
rascal
to
touch
me
Nikolai
Petrovitch
sighed
To
whom
the
words
referred
he
had
not
a
notion
At
eight
o'clock
next
morning
Bazarov
entered
Nikolai
's
room
His
stock
of
insects
birds
and
frogs
had
either
been
packed
up
or
liberated
Rising
to
meet
him
Nikolai
said
So
you
have
come
to
say
good-bye
I
have
I
understand
your
feelings
and
I
commend
them
I
know
that
my
poor
brother
alone
was
to
blame
and
is
now
paying
the
penalty
Also
I
gather
from
what
he
says
that
your
position
was
such
that
you
could
not
possibly
have
acted
otherwise
than
as
you
did
that
for
you
to
have
avoided
this
duel
would
have
been
impossible
That
being
so
we
must
attribute
the
mischance
to
the
er
standing
antagonism
of
your
views
here
Nikolai
Petrovitch
tripped
over
his
words
a
little
My
brother
is
one
of
the
old
school
a
man
of
hot
temper
and
great
persistency
Consequently
we
have
God
to
thank
that
things
have
turned
out
no
worse
Finally
I
may
say
that
every
possible
precaution
against
publicity
has
been
taken
Quite
so
said
Bazarov
carelessly
But
I
will
leave
my
address
with
you
in
case
of
anything
occurring
I
hope
that
nothing
will
occur
Indeed
my
one
regret
is
that
your
stay
in
my
house
should
have
should
have
terminated
in
such
a
fashion
And
I
am
the
more
grieved
in
that
Arkady
I
expect
to
be
seeing
him
very
soon
interrupted
Bazarov
whom
explanations
or
speeches
of
any
kind
always
roused
to
fever
pitch
On
the
other
hand
should
I
not
do
so
pray
convey
to
him
my
greetings
and
my
regrets
I
will
said
Nikolai
Petrovitch
with
a
bow
but
even
before
he
had
finished
Bazarov
had
left
the
room
Paul
Petrovitch
too
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
Bazarov
was
on
the
point
of
departing
expressed
a
desire
to
see
him
and
to
shake
hands
with
him
Yet
Bazarov
remained
as
cold
as
ice
for
well
he
knew
that
Paul
Petrovitch
's
only
aim
was
to
make
a
show
of
magnanimity
while
to
Thenichka
he
did
not
say
good-bye
at
all
he
merely
exchanged
with
her
a
glance
as
she
peeped
from
one
of
the
windows
Her
face
looked
to
him
careworn
Before
long
she
will
either
trip
or
elope
he
reflected
On
the
other
hand
Peter
was
so
moved
at
the
prospect
of
parting
with
his
patron
that
he
wept
on
the
latter
's
shoulder
until
his
transports
were
cooled
with
the
question
Surely
your
eyes
are
not
made
of
water
while
Duniasha
's
emotion
was
such
that
she
had
to
take
refuge
in
a
thicket
Meanwhile
the
cause
of
all
this
grief
mounted
the
travelling-cart
and
lit
a
cigar
and
even
when
he
had
travelled
four
versts
and
reached
a
spot
where
a
turn
in
the
road
brought
the
Kirsanov
farm
into
line
with
the
new
manor-house
he
merely
expectorated
some
tobacco
juice
and
muttered
as
he
wrapped
himself
closer
in
his
cloak
The
cursed
tomnoddies
Thenceforth
Paul
Petrovitch
began
to
mend
but
still
was
ordered
to
keep
his
bed
for
another
week
What
he
called
his
imprisonment
he
bore
with
very
fair
patience
although
he
remained
fussy
in
the
matter
of
his
toilet
and
constantly
had
himself
sprinkled
with
eau-de-Cologne
Meanwhile
Nikolai
Petrovitch
read
aloud
to
him
the
newspapers
and
Thenichka
served
him
with
soup
lemonade
scrambled
eggs
and
tea
Yet
she
never
entered
the
room
without
feeling
a
mysterious
nervousness
come
over
her
Paul
Petrovitch
's
unexpected
behaviour
had
frightened
every
one
in
the
house
but
her
it
had
frightened
most
of
all
Only
old
Prokofitch
seemed
undismayed
at
the
occurrence
and
kept
asserting
that
in
his
day
the
gentry
used
to
bore
holes
in
one
another
right
enough
but
only
the
gentry
Jackanapes
like
that
Bazarov
would
have
been
ducked
in
the
gutter
for
their
pains
Thenichka
felt
little
pricking
of
conscience
but
there
were
times
when
the
thought
of
the
true
cause
of
the
quarrel
rendered
her
at
least
uneasy
and
the
more
so
because
Paul
Petrovitch
's
way
of
looking
at
her
was
now
so
strange
that
even
when
she
turned
her
back
to
him
she
could
still
feel
his
eyes
upon
her
In
combination
therefore
her
worries
led
to
her
growing
thinner
and
also
as
often
happens
in
such
circumstances
to
her
adding
to
her
beauty
At
length
one
morning
Paul
Petrovitch
felt
so
much
better
that
he
left
his
bed
and
removed
to
the
sofa
while
Nikolai
Petrovitch
after
seeing
that
he
had
all
he
wanted
betook
himself
to
the
farm
Also
it
fell
to
Thenichka
's
lot
to
take
the
invalid
a
cup
of
tea
and
when
she
had
placed
it
on
the
table
she
was
about
to
withdraw
when
Paul
Petrovitch
requested
her
to
remain
Why
should
you
hurry
away
he
said
Is
it
that
you
have
other
things
to
do
No
yes
That
is
to
say
I
have
to
go
and
pour
out
tea
for
the
servants
Duniasha
can
do
that
Surely
you
will
stay
awhile
with
a
sick
man
who
has
something
of
great
importance
to
say
to
you
Silently
she
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
Listen
he
continued
as
he
tugged
at
his
moustache
For
some
time
past
I
have
been
wanting
to
ask
you
why
you
are
so
afraid
of
me
Afraid
of
you
Yes
for
you
never
look
at
me
In
fact
one
would
think
that
your
conscience
was
uneasy
Her
face
reddened
but
she
looked
Paul
Petrovitch
straight
in
the
eyes
Somehow
his
aspect
struck
her
as
peculiar
and
her
heart
began
to
throb
Is
your
conscience
clear
he
asked
Yes
Why
should
it
not
be
she
responded
in
a
whisper
I
do
not
know
Certainly
I
can
recall
no
one
against
whom
you
can
have
committed
a
fault
Against
me
It
is
scarcely
probable
Against
others
in
this
house
That
is
as
improbable
Against
my
brother
But
him
you
love
do
you
not
I
do
With
your
whole
heart
and
soul
With
my
whole
heart
and
soul
Really
and
truly
Thenichka
never
before
had
he
addressed
her
thus
Look
me
in
the
eyes
To
lie
is
a
terrible
sin
You
know
that
of
course
But
I
am
not
lying
Paul
Petrovitch
Did
I
not
love
Nikolai
Petrovitch
I
should
not
want
to
live
And
you
would
exchange
him
for
no
one
else
Whom
should
I
exchange
him
for
I
do
not
know
Surely
not
for
the
gentlemen
who
has
just
left
us
Thenichka
rose
to
her
feet
Why
should
you
torment
me
in
this
way
she
cried
What
have
I
done
that
you
should
speak
to
me
so
Thenichka
came
the
mournful
reply
I
speak
to
you
in
this
manner
for
the
reason
that
I
saw
You
saw
what
I
saw
you
in
the
lilac
arbour
She
blushed
to
her
ears
to
the
very
roots
of
her
hair
But
how
was
I
to
blame
at
length
she
contrived
to
say
Paul
Petrovitch
raised
himself
on
the
sofa
You
swear
do
you
that
you
were
not
to
blame
he
said
That
you
were
not
in
the
slightest
degree
to
blame
Not
at
all
I
love
Nikolai
Petrovitch
came
the
reply
delivered
with
sudden
energy
and
a
rising
sob
and
never
shall
I
love
any
other
man
As
for
what
you
saw
before
the
Throne
of
Judgment
I
swear
that
I
am
innocent
that
I
have
always
been
so
and
that
I
would
rather
die
than
be
suspected
of
having
deceived
Nikolai
Petrovitch
my
benefactor
Her
voice
failed
her
Then
behold
she
felt
Paul
seize
and
press
her
hand
Turning
her
head
she
looked
down
at
him
and
stood
almost
petrified
For
his
face
was
even
paler
than
usual
his
eyes
were
glistening
and
most
surprising
thing
of
all
a
great
tear
was
trickling
down
his
cheek
Thenichka
he
whispered
in
a
voice
which
hardly
seemed
his
own
I
beg
of
you
always
to
love
and
never
to
cease
loving
my
brother
He
is
such
a
good
kind
fellow
as
has
not
his
equal
in
the
world
Never
desert
him
for
another
never
listen
to
any
tales
which
you
may
hear
of
him
but
reflect
how
terrible
it
would
be
for
him
to
love
and
not
to
be
loved
Yes
think
well
Thenichka
before
ever
you
forsake
him
Thenichka
's
amazement
caused
her
eyes
almost
to
start
from
her
head
and
her
nervousness
completely
to
vanish
Judge
also
of
her
surprise
when
though
he
did
not
draw
her
to
himself
nor
kiss
her
Paul
Petrovitch
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
then
burst
into
a
convulsive
fit
of
sobbing
God
in
Heaven
she
thought
to
herself
What
if
this
should
make
him
have
another
fainting
fit
Meanwhile
in
that
one
moment
Paul
Petrovitch
was
living
over
again
a
past
phase
of
his
ruined
life
Presently
hurried
footsteps
were
heard
causing
the
staircase
to
creak
and
just
as
Paul
pushed
Thenichka
away
from
him
and
replaced
his
head
upon
the
pillow
the
door
opened
and
Nikolai
Petrovitch
fresh
ruddy
and
smiling
entered
with
little
Mitia
The
latter
equally
fresh
and
ruddy
was
leaping
in
Nikolai
's
arms
and
pressing
his
tiny
naked
feet
against
the
buttons
of
his
father
's
rural
smock
Running
to
father
and
child
Thenichka
threw
her
arms
around
both
alike
and
sank
her
head
upon
the
former
's
shoulder
This
caused
him
to
halt
in
amazement
for
never
before
had
the
bashful
reserved
Thenichka
shown
him
any
endearment
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
What
is
the
matter
he
exclaimed
Then
he
glanced
at
Paul
handed
Mitia
to
Thenichka
and
approaching
the
bedside
inquired
if
his
brother
were
worse
Paul
's
face
was
buried
in
his
handkerchief
but
he
replied
Oh
dear
no
Not
at
all
If
anything
I
am
better
yes
very
much
better
Nevertheless
you
have
been
over-hasty
in
removing
to
the
sofa
said
Nikolai
Petrovitch
after
which
he
turned
to
ask
Thenichka
why
she
was
leaving
the
room
but
she
departed
abruptly
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
I
had
come
to
show
you
my
little
rascal
Nikolai
continued
He
had
been
pining
for
a
sight
of
his
uncle
But
she
has
carried
him
away
for
some
reason
What
is
the
matter
Has
something
occurred
My
brother
replied
Paul
Petrovitch
and
as
he
uttered
the
words
Nikolai
Petrovitch
gave
a
start
and
felt
ill
at
ease
he
knew
not
why
My
brother
pray
give
me
your
word
of
honour
that
you
will
fulfil
the
request
which
I
am
going
to
make
What
request
Paul
I
beg
of
you
to
continue
A
request
of
the
first
importance
Upon
it
I
believe
your
entire
happiness
depends
Also
what
I
am
going
to
say
represents
the
fruit
of
much
thought
My
brother
the
request
is
that
you
will
do
your
duty
the
duty
of
a
good
and
honourable
man
In
other
words
I
beseech
you
to
put
an
end
to
this
scandal
and
bad
example
which
is
unworthy
of
you
unworthy
of
a
man
who
is
the
best
of
souls
To
what
do
you
refer
Paul
To
this
You
ought
to
marry
Thenichka
She
loves
you
and
is
the
mother
of
your
child
Stepping
back
Nikolai
Petrovitch
clasped
his
hands
together
Do
you
say
this
he
exclaimed
Do
you
say
this
you
whom
I
have
always
understood
to
be
opposed
to
such
unions
Do
you
say
this
Surely
you
know
that
solely
out
of
respect
for
yourself
have
I
hitherto
refrained
from
doing
what
rightfully
you
call
my
duty
Wrongfully
then
have
you
respected
me
said
Paul
Petrovitch
with
a
sad
smile
In
fact
almost
I
am
beginning
to
think
that
Bazarov
was
right
when
he
accused
me
of
only
feigning
the
aristocratic
instinct
For
it
is
not
enough
for
you
and
me
to
trouble
ourselves
about
worldly
matters
alone
We
are
old
men
past
our
prime
who
ought
to
lay
aside
all
pettinesses
and
to
fulfil
strictly
our
obligations
Nor
forget
that
should
we
thus
act
we
shall
receive
an
added
measure
of
happiness
as
our
reward
Nikolai
Petrovitch
flung
himself
upon
his
brother
and
embraced
him
again
and
again
You
have
opened
my
eyes
he
cried
When
I
described
you
as
the
best
man
in
the
world
I
was
not
wrong
and
now
I
perceive
your
wisdom
to
be
equal
to
your
magnanimity
Quieter
quieter
advised
Paul
Do
not
further
inflame
the
leg
of
an
old
fool
who
at
fifty
has
fought
a
duel
like
a
young
ensign
Then
the
matter
is
settled
and
Thenichka
is
to
become
my
belle-soeur
Yes
my
dearest
Paul
But
what
will
Arkady
say
Arkady
He
will
be
delighted
True
marriage
does
not
come
within
his
purview
or
principles
but
at
least
his
sense
of
social
equality
will
be
tickled
And
in
the
nineteenth
century
what
does
caste
matter
Paul
Paul
let
me
embrace
you
once
more
You
need
not
be
afraid
I
will
do
it
very
carefully
And
the
two
brothers
flung
their
arms
around
one
another
Well
continued
Paul
Petrovitch
What
think
you
Shall
we
tell
her
at
once
No
we
need
not
be
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
replied
Nikolai
Petrovitch
As
a
matter
of
fact
you
have
been
having
a
talk
with
her
have
you
not
I
have
been
having
a
talk
with
her
Quelle
idée
However
your
first
business
is
to
recover
Thenichka
will
not
run
away
and
in
the
meanwhile
the
affair
must
be
carefully
considered
Then
you
have
decided
upon
it
Certainly
I
have
And
I
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
But
I
must
leave
you
for
a
while
now
for
you
ought
to
have
some
rest
and
any
excitement
is
bad
for
you
Matters
can
be
discussed
later
Go
to
sleep
dearest
of
brothers
and
may
God
restore
you
to
health
Why
did
he
thank
me
thought
Paul
Petrovitch
to
himself
after
Nikolai
had
gone
Does
not
the
affair
depend
upon
him
alone
seeing
that
after
the
marriage
I
myself
shall
have
to
depart
elsewhere
to
Dresden
or
to
Florence
and
to
abide
there
until
I
die
He
bathed
his
forehead
with
eau-de-Cologne
and
then
closed
his
eyes
As
he
lay
with
his
handsome
refined
head
resting
on
the
pillow
he
looked
in
the
clear
light
of
the
sun
like
a
corpse

Ann
Radcliffe
née
Ward
1764-1823
an
English
novelist
who
wrote
The
Mysteries
of
Udolpho
and
other
tales
and
travelled
extensively
In
the
shade
of
a
tall
ash
tree
in
the
garden
at
Nikolsköe
Katia
and
Arkady
were
seated
on
a
bench
Beside
them
on
the
ground
lay
Fifi
his
lengthy
body
twisted
into
the
curve
known
to
sporting
folk
as
the
hare
's
crouch
Neither
from
Arkady
nor
from
Katia
was
a
word
proceeding
Arkady
was
holding
in
his
hands
a
half-opened
book
and
she
was
picking
a
few
crumbs
from
a
basket
and
throwing
them
to
a
small
family
of
sparrows
which
with
the
timid
temerity
of
their
tribe
were
chirping
and
hopping
at
her
very
feet
A
faint
breeze
was
stirring
the
leaves
of
the
ash
tree
and
dappling
Fifi
's
tawny
back
and
the
dark
line
of
the
pathway
with
a
number
of
wavering
circles
of
pale
golden
light
but
Arkady
and
Katia
were
wholly
in
shade
save
that
an
occasional
streak
glanced
upon
and
gleamed
in
her
hair
Just
for
the
reason
that
the
pair
were
silent
and
side
by
side
was
there
present
to
their
consciousness
a
camaraderie
which
while
causing
neither
to
have
the
other
definitely
in
mind
pleased
each
with
the
sense
of
the
other
's
propinquity
The
expression
of
both
is
changed
since
last
we
saw
them
Arkady
's
face
wears
a
staider
air
and
Katia
looks
more
animated
and
less
retiring
At
length
however
Arkady
spoke
Do
you
not
think
he
said
that
our
Russian
term
yasen
is
particularly
suitable
to
the
ash
tree
For
no
other
tree
cleaves
the
air
with
such
airy
brightness
1
Katia
looked
up
I
agree
she
replied
while
Arkady
proudly
reflected
At
all
events
she
does
not
reprove
me
for
talking
in
'beautiful
language
By
the
way
Katia
continued
with
a
glance
at
the
book
in
his
hands
I
can
not
say
that
I
always
approve
of
Heine
I
like
him
neither
when
he
is
laughing
nor
when
he
is
in
tears
I
like
him
only
when
he
is
meditative
and
languid
Well
I
like
him
when
he
is
laughing
Arkady
remarked
Then
still
there
survives
in
you
a
trace
of
your
old
satirical
tendency
Still
your
reformation
needs
to
be
completed
Indeed
thought
Arkady
My
satirical
tendency
Oh
that
Bazarov
could
have
heard
that
While
aloud
he
said
Who
is
'we
Yourself
Oh
dear
no
My
sister
and
Porfiri
Platonitch
with
whom
you
no
longer
quarrel
and
my
aunt
whom
three
days
ago
you
escorted
to
church
I
did
so
only
because
I
could
not
refuse
And
as
regards
Anna
Sergievna
kindly
remember
that
in
many
things
she
agrees
with
Bazarov
Yes
she
used
to
be
greatly
under
his
influence
and
so
did
you
And
so
did
I
Then
am
I
now
emancipated
from
that
influence
Katia
returned
no
reply
I
know
that
you
never
liked
him
Arkady
continued
Did
I
not
It
was
not
for
me
to
judge
him
Never
do
I
hear
that
reply
without
declining
to
believe
it
There
is
not
a
person
living
whom
all
of
us
have
not
the
right
to
judge
A
disclaimer
of
that
kind
always
represents
an
excuse
To
tell
the
truth
I
disliked
him
less
than
I
felt
him
to
be
a
stranger
to
me
as
complete
a
one
as
I
to
him
or
you
either
for
that
matter
What
do
you
mean
I
mean
that
well
how
can
I
express
it
That
whereas
he
was
a
wild
bird
you
and
I
are
tame
ones
I
am
a
tame
one
Katia
nodded
assent
Arkady
scratched
his
ear
Look
here
he
said
I
may
tell
you
that
that
constitutes
in
essence
an
insult
Why
so
Do
you
want
to
be
a
wild
bird
Not
necessarily
a
wild
one
but
at
least
one
strong
and
energetic
You
need
wish
no
such
thing
Your
friend
was
both
yet
he
would
rather
have
been
otherwise
H
'm
You
believe
that
he
used
to
exercise
a
considerable
influence
over
Anna
Sergievna
Yes
But
no
one
can
hold
a
rein
over
her
for
long
Katia
added
this
last
sotto
voce
What
makes
you
think
that
The
fact
that
she
is
very
proud
rather
that
she
values
her
independence
Who
does
not
queried
Arkady
while
there
flashed
through
his
mind
the
thought
Why
this
mention
of
her
Curiously
enough
the
same
thought
occurred
to
Katia
too
But
this
was
not
so
curious
as
might
have
been
supposed
seeing
that
when
young
people
meet
in
frequent
and
amicable
converse
identical
thoughts
are
apt
to
enter
their
brains
Arkady
smiled
edged
nearer
to
Katia
and
said
in
a
whisper
Confess
that
you
are
a
little
afraid
of
her
Of
whom
Of
her
repeated
Arkady
meaningly
Are
you
afraid
of
her
countered
Katia
I
am
Please
note
that
I
believe
you
to
be
the
same
Katia
raised
a
menacing
finger
I
am
surprised
at
you
she
exclaimed
Never
at
any
time
has
my
sister
been
better
disposed
towards
you
than
she
is
now
She
likes
you
considerably
more
than
when
you
first
came
Really
Yes
And
have
you
not
noticed
it
You
ought
to
be
pleased
at
the
notion
Arkady
reflected
How
I
have
contrived
to
win
Anna
Sergievna
's
good
graces
I
do
not
know
at
length
he
said
Surely
it
can
not
be
because
I
brought
her
those
letters
which
were
written
by
your
mother
It
is
though
and
because
of
other
reasons
as
well
reasons
which
I
will
forbear
to
mention
Why
will
you
Because
I
will
Oh
I
know
your
faculty
for
obstinacy
It
is
one
which
I
possess
Also
your
faculty
for
observing
things
Katia
glanced
at
him
Then
she
inquired
Why
lose
your
temper
What
are
you
thinking
of
This
that
I
can
not
understand
how
you
come
to
possess
those
powers
of
observation
which
undoubtedly
are
yours
I
understand
it
the
less
because
you
are
so
nervous
and
distrustful
and
shy
of
everybody
and
It
is
because
I
have
lived
such
a
lonely
life
A
life
of
that
kind
leads
one
to
reflect
in
spite
of
oneself
Am
I
shy
of
every
one
though
Arkady
bestowed
upon
her
an
appreciative
glance
Never
mind
he
said
At
all
events
it
is
not
often
that
people
in
your
position
I
mean
people
of
your
wealth
possess
such
a
gift
To
them
as
to
the
Tsars
truth
penetrates
hardly
But
I
am
not
wealthy
Arkady
failed
at
first
to
follow
her
meaning
but
reflected
Certainly
the
property
belongs
to
her
sister
not
to
her
Nor
was
the
thought
wholly
unpleasing
so
little
so
that
presently
he
added
You
said
that
very
prettily
I
said
what
That
you
are
not
wealthy
You
said
it
so
simply
so
without
any
false
shame
so
without
the
least
arrière
pensée
Apropos
the
consciousness
of
the
ordinary
person
who
both
knows
and
confesses
that
he
or
she
is
poor
always
seems
to
me
to
contain
more
than
the
mere
words
imply
it
harbours
also
a
touch
of
vanity
I
have
thanks
to
my
sister
had
no
experience
of
poverty
And
as
for
my
possessions
I
mentioned
them
only
because
the
words
came
of
themselves
to
my
lips
Quite
so
Yet
confess
that
you
too
harbour
a
grain
of
the
vanity
to
which
I
have
alluded
Give
me
an
example
of
my
doing
so
An
example
Well
may
I
ask
why
you
have
not
married
a
rich
man
Were
I
to
love
such
a
one
very
much
I
But
no
man
of
that
sort
has
come
my
way
wherefore
I
have
made
no
such
marriage
There
now
cried
Arkady
But
why
should
you
not
do
so
in
the
future
Because
even
the
poets
deprecate
mésalliances
You
mean
that
you
wish
either
to
rule
or
Oh
no
What
good
would
that
be
On
the
contrary
I
am
prepared
to
be
ruled
even
though
I
believe
that
inequality
in
any
form
works
badly
A
union
of
self-respect
with
submission
that
is
what
I
best
understand
that
is
what
spells
true
happiness
A
mere
subordinate
existence
is
well
something
which
I
do
not
fancy
'Something
which
I
do
not
fancy
commented
Arkady
Yes
you
are
of
the
same
blood
as
Anna
Sergievna
you
are
as
independent
as
she
and
you
are
even
more
secretive
In
fact
however
deep-rooted
and
sacred
a
stock
of
sentiments
you
might
hold
you
would
never
of
your
own
accord
give
them
utterance
Of
course
How
could
you
suppose
anything
else
Also
you
are
clever
and
have
a
measure
of
character
equal
to
if
not
greater
than
hers
I
dislike
being
compared
with
my
sister
You
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
she
is
both
'beautiful
and
'intellectual
and
Moreover
you
above
all
people
ought
not
to
say
anything
to
her
disparagement
and
still
less
to
say
it
seriously
Why
'_you_
above
all
people
Do
you
think
that
I
am
jesting
I
am
certain
of
it
Indeed
But
what
if
I
were
to
say
that
I
really
mean
my
words
What
if
I
were
to
say
that
if
anything
I
have
under-expressed
what
is
in
my
mind
I
fail
to
follow
you
Do
you
Your
quickness
of
perception
has
been
overrated
Why
has
it
Averting
his
head
Arkady
returned
no
reply
while
Katia
fell
to
searching
for
the
last
crumbs
in
her
basket
and
throwing
them
to
the
sparrows
Unfortunately
the
throw
of
her
arm
proved
too
strong
and
the
birds
flew
away
without
even
touching
the
food
offered
them
Katia
said
Arkady
it
may
be
that
you
look
upon
these
things
as
matters
of
no
moment
Kindly
note
therefore
that
neither
for
your
sister
nor
for
any
other
person
would
I
exchange
Mademoiselle
Katerina
Sergievna
Rising
he
walked
away
as
though
in
sudden
alarm
at
having
allowed
the
words
to
escape
his
lips
Meanwhile
Katia
with
her
hands
resting
upon
the
basket
and
her
head
bent
gazed
after
him
Gradually
there
crept
into
her
cheeks
a
rosy
tint
and
though
her
lips
were
not
smiling
and
her
dark
eyes
contained
a
hint
of
perplexity
there
lurked
also
in
her
expression
another
unexpressed
feeling
Are
you
alone
said
Anna
Sergievna
's
voice
from
behind
her
I
thought
that
Arkady
came
with
you
into
the
garden
Katia
slowly
raised
her
eyes
to
her
