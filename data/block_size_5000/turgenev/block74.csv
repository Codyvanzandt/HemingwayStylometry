him
often
and
that
s
all
What
more
is
there
to
write
Paul
shuts
himself
up
Andrei
Petrovitch
has
taken
to
coming
less
often
poor
fellow
I
fancy
he
But
that
can
never
be
though
I
like
talking
to
Andrei
Petrovitch
never
a
word
of
self
always
of
something
sensible
useful
Very
different
from
Shubin
Shubin
s
as
fine
as
a
butterfly
and
admires
his
own
finery
which
butterflies
don
t
do
But
both
Shubin
and
Andrei
Petrovitch
I
know
what
I
mean
He
enjoys
coming
to
us
I
see
that
But
why
what
does
he
find
in
me
It
s
true
our
tastes
are
alike
he
and
I
both
of
us
don
t
care
for
poetry
neither
of
us
knows
anything
of
art
But
how
much
better
he
is
than
I
He
is
calm
I
am
in
perpetual
excitement
he
has
chosen
his
path
his
aim
while
I
where
am
I
going
where
is
my
home
He
is
calm
but
all
his
thoughts
are
far
away
The
time
will
come
and
he
will
leave
us
for
ever
will
go
home
there
over
the
sea
Well
God
grant
he
may
Any
way
I
shall
be
glad
that
I
knew
him
while
he
was
here
Why
isn
t
he
a
Russian
No
he
could
not
be
Russian
Mamma
too
likes
him
she
says
an
unassuming
young
man
Dear
mamma
She
does
not
understand
him
Paul
says
nothing
he
guessed
I
didn
t
like
his
hints
but
he
s
jealous
of
him
Spiteful
boy
And
what
right
has
he
Did
I
ever
All
that
s
nonsense
What
makes
all
that
come
into
my
head
Isn
t
it
strange
though
that
up
till
now
up
to
twenty
I
have
never
loved
any
one
I
believe
that
the
reason
why
D
s
I
shall
call
him
D
I
like
that
name
Dmitri
soul
is
so
clear
is
that
he
is
entirely
given
up
to
his
work
his
ideal
What
has
he
to
trouble
about
When
any
one
has
utterly
utterly
given
himself
up
he
has
little
sorrow
he
is
not
responsible
for
anything
It
s
not
I
want
but
it
wants
By
the
way
he
and
I
both
love
the
same
flowers
I
picked
a
rose
this
morning
one
leaf
fell
he
picked
it
up
I
gave
him
the
whole
rose
D
often
comes
to
us
Yesterday
he
spent
the
whole
evening
He
wants
to
teach
me
Bulgarian
I
feel
happy
with
him
quite
at
home
more
than
at
home
The
days
fly
past
I
am
happy
and
somehow
discontent
and
I
am
thankful
to
God
and
tears
are
not
far
off
Oh
these
hot
bright
days
I
am
still
light-hearted
as
before
and
only
at
times
and
only
a
little
sad
I
am
happy
Am
I
happy
It
will
be
long
before
I
forget
the
expedition
yesterday
What
strange
new
terrible
impressions
when
he
suddenly
took
that
great
giant
and
flung
him
like
a
ball
into
the
water
I
was
not
frightened
yet
he
frightened
me
And
afterwards
what
an
angry
face
almost
cruel
How
he
said
He
will
swim
out
It
gave
me
a
shock
So
I
did
not
understand
him
And
afterwards
when
they
all
laughed
when
I
was
laughing
how
I
felt
for
him
He
was
ashamed
I
felt
that
he
was
ashamed
before
me
He
told
me
so
afterwards
in
the
carriage
in
the
dark
when
I
tried
to
get
a
good
view
of
him
and
was
afraid
of
him
Yes
he
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
he
is
a
splendid
champion
But
why
that
wicked
look
those
trembling
lips
that
angry
fire
in
his
eyes
Or
is
it
perhaps
inevitable
Isn
t
it
possible
to
be
a
man
a
hero
and
to
remain
soft
and
gentle
Life
is
a
coarse
business
he
said
to
me
once
lately
I
repeated
that
saying
to
Andrei
Petrovitch
he
did
not
agree
with
D
Which
of
them
is
right
But
the
beginning
of
that
day
How
happy
I
was
walking
beside
him
even
without
speaking
But
I
am
glad
of
what
happened
I
see
that
it
was
quite
as
it
should
be
Restlessness
again
I
am
not
quite
well
All
these
days
I
have
written
nothing
in
this
book
because
I
have
had
no
wish
to
write
I
felt
whatever
I
write
it
won
t
be
what
is
in
my
heart
And
what
is
in
my
heart
I
have
had
a
long
talk
with
him
which
revealed
a
great
deal
He
told
me
his
plan
by
the
way
I
know
now
how
he
got
the
wound
in
his
neck
Good
God
when
I
think
he
was
actually
condemned
to
death
that
he
was
only
just
saved
that
he
was
wounded
He
prophesies
war
and
will
be
glad
of
it
And
for
all
that
I
never
saw
D
so
depressed
What
can
he
he
be
depressed
by
Papa
arrived
home
from
town
and
came
upon
us
two
He
looked
rather
queerly
at
us
Andrei
Petrovitch
came
I
noticed
he
had
grown
very
thin
and
pale
He
reproved
me
saying
I
behave
too
coldly
and
inconsiderately
to
Shubin
I
had
utterly
forgotten
Paul
s
existence
I
will
see
him
and
try
to
smooth
over
my
offence
He
is
nothing
to
me
now
nor
any
one
else
in
the
world
Andrei
Petrovitch
talked
to
me
in
a
sort
of
commiserating
way
What
does
it
all
mean
Why
is
everything
around
me
and
within
me
so
dark
I
feel
as
if
about
me
and
within
me
something
mysterious
were
happening
for
which
I
want
to
find
the
right
word
I
did
not
sleep
all
night
my
head
aches
What
s
the
good
of
writing
He
went
away
so
quickly
to-day
and
I
wanted
to
talk
to
him
He
almost
seems
to
avoid
me
Yes
he
avoids
me
The
word
is
found
light
has
dawned
on
me
My
God
have
pity
on
me
I
love
him
On
the
very
day
on
which
Elena
had
written
this
last
fatal
line
in
her
diary
Insarov
was
sitting
in
Bersenyev
s
room
and
Bersenyev
was
standing
before
him
with
a
look
of
perplexity
on
his
face
Insarov
had
just
announced
his
intention
of
returning
to
Moscow
the
next
day
Upon
my
word
cried
Bersenyev
Why
the
finest
part
of
the
summer
is
just
beginning
What
will
you
do
in
Moscow
What
a
sudden
decision
Or
have
you
had
news
of
some
sort
I
have
had
no
news
replied
Insarov
but
on
thinking
things
over
I
find
I
can
not
stop
here
How
can
that
be
Andrei
Petrovitch
said
Insarov
be
so
kind
don
t
insist
please
I
am
very
sorry
myself
to
be
leaving
you
but
it
can
t
be
helped
Bersenyev
looked
at
him
intently
I
know
he
said
at
last
there
s
no
persuading
you
And
so
it
s
a
settled
matter
Is
it
Absolutely
settled
replied
Insarov
getting
up
and
going
away
Bersenyev
walked
about
the
room
then
took
his
hat
and
set
off
for
the
Stahovs
You
have
something
to
tell
me
Elena
said
to
him
directly
they
were
left
alone
Yes
how
did
you
guess
Never
mind
tell
me
what
it
is
Bersenyev
told
her
of
Insarov
s
intention
Elena
turned
white
What
does
it
mean
she
articulated
with
effort
You
know
observed
Bersenyev
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
does
not
care
to
give
reasons
for
his
actions
But
I
think
let
us
sit
down
Elena
Nikolaevna
you
don
t
seem
very
well
I
fancy
I
can
guess
what
is
the
real
cause
of
this
sudden
departure
What
what
cause
repeated
Elena
and
unconsciously
she
gripped
tightly
Bersenyev
s
hand
in
her
chill
ringers
You
see
began
Bersenyev
with
a
pathetic
smile
how
can
I
explain
to
you
I
must
go
back
to
last
spring
to
the
time
when
I
began
to
be
more
intimate
with
Insarov
I
used
to
meet
him
then
at
the
house
of
a
relative
who
had
a
daughter
a
very
pretty
girl
I
thought
that
Insarov
cared
for
her
and
I
told
him
so
He
laughed
and
answered
that
I
was
mistaken
that
he
was
quite
heart-whole
but
if
anything
of
that
sort
did
happen
to
him
he
should
run
away
directly
as
he
did
not
want
in
his
own
words
for
the
sake
of
personal
feeling
to
be
false
to
his
cause
and
his
duty
I
am
a
Bulgarian
he
said
and
I
have
no
need
of
a
Russian
love
Well
so
now
you
whispered
Elena
She
involuntarily
turned
away
her
head
like
a
man
expecting
a
blow
but
she
still
held
the
hand
she
had
clutched
I
think
he
said
and
his
own
voice
sank
I
think
that
what
I
fancied
then
has
really
happened
now
That
is
you
think
don
t
torture
me
broke
suddenly
from
Elena
I
think
Bersenyev
continued
hurriedly
that
Insarov
is
in
love
now
with
a
Russian
girl
and
he
is
resolved
to
go
according
to
his
word
Elena
clasped
his
hand
still
tighter
and
her
head
drooped
still
lower
as
if
she
would
hide
from
other
eyes
the
flush
of
shame
which
suddenly
blazed
over
her
face
and
neck
Andrei
Petrovitch
you
are
kind
as
an
angel
she
said
but
will
he
come
to
say
goodbye
Yes
I
imagine
so
he
will
be
sure
to
come
He
wouldn
t
like
to
go
away
Tell
him
tell
him
But
here
the
poor
girl
broke
down
tears
rushed
streaming
from
her
eyes
and
she
ran
out
of
the
room
So
that
s
how
she
loves
him
thought
Bersenyev
as
he
walked
slowly
home
I
didn
t
expect
that
I
didn
t
think
she
felt
so
strongly
I
am
kind
she
says
he
pursued
his
reflections
Who
can
tell
what
feelings
what
impulse
drove
me
to
tell
Elena
all
that
It
was
not
kindness
no
not
kindness
It
was
all
the
accursed
desire
to
make
sure
whether
the
dagger
is
really
in
the
wound
I
ought
to
be
content
They
love
each
other
and
I
have
been
of
use
to
them
The
future
go-between
between
science
and
the
Russian
public
Shubin
calls
me
it
seems
as
though
it
had
been
decreed
at
my
birth
that
I
should
be
a
go-between
But
if
I
m
mistaken
No
I
m
not
mistaken
It
was
bitter
for
Andrei
Petrovitch
and
he
could
not
turn
his
mind
to
Raumer
The
next
day
at
two
o
clock
Insarov
arrived
at
the
Stahovs
As
though
by
express
design
there
was
a
visitor
in
Anna
Vassilyevna
s
drawing-room
at
the
time
the
wife
of
a
neighbouring
chief-priest
an
excellent
and
worthy
woman
though
she
had
had
a
little
unpleasantness
with
the
police
because
she
thought
fit
in
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
to
bathe
in
a
lake
near
the
road
along
which
a
certain
dignified
general
s
family
used
often
to
be
passing
The
presence
of
an
outside
person
was
at
first
even
a
relief
to
Elena
from
whose
face
every
trace
of
colour
vanished
directly
she
heard
Insarov
s
step
but
her
heart
sank
at
the
thought
that
he
might
go
without
a
word
with
her
alone
He
too
seemed
confused
and
avoided
meeting
her
eyes
Surely
he
will
not
go
directly
thought
Elena
Insarov
was
in
fact
turning
to
take
leave
of
Anna
Vassilyevna
Elena
hastily
rose
and
called
him
aside
to
the
window
The
priest
s
wife
was
surprised
and
tried
to
turn
round
but
she
was
so
tightly
laced
that
her
stays
creaked
at
every
movement
and
she
stayed
where
she
was
Listen
said
Elena
hurriedly
I
know
what
you
have
come
for
Andrei
Petrovitch
told
me
of
your
intention
but
I
beg
I
entreat
you
do
not
say
good-bye
to
us
to-day
but
come
here
to-morrow
rather
earlier
at
eleven
I
must
have
a
few
words
with
you
Insarov
bent
his
head
without
speaking
I
will
not
keep
you
You
promise
me
Again
Insarov
bowed
but
said
nothing
Lenotchka
come
here
said
Anna
Vassilyevna
look
what
a
charming
reticule
I
worked
it
myself
observed
the
priest
s
wife
Elena
came
away
from
the
window
Insarov
did
not
stay
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
Stahovs
Elena
watched
him
secretly
He
was
restless
and
ill
at
ease
As
before
he
did
not
know
where
to
look
and
he
went
away
strangely
and
suddenly
he
seemed
to
vanish
Slowly
passed
that
day
for
Elena
still
more
slowly
dragged
on
the
long
long
night
Elena
sat
on
her
bed
her
arms
clasping
her
knees
and
her
head
laid
on
them
then
she
walked
to
the
window
pressed
her
burning
forehead
against
the
cold
glass
and
thought
and
thought
going
over
and
over
the
same
thoughts
till
she
was
exhausted
Her
heart
seemed
turned
to
stone
she
did
not
feel
it
but
the
veins
in
her
head
throbbed
painfully
her
hair
stifled
her
and
her
lips
were
dry
He
will
come
he
did
not
say
good-bye
to
mamma
he
will
not
deceive
me
Can
Andrei
Petrovitch
have
been
right
It
can
not
be
He
didn
t
promise
to
come
in
words
Can
I
have
parted
from
him
for
ever
Those
were
the
thoughts
that
never
left
her
literally
never
left
her
they
did
not
come
and
come
again
they
were
for
ever
turning
like
a
mist
moving
about
in
her
brain
He
loves
me
suddenly
flashed
through
her
setting
her
whole
nature
on
fire
and
she
gazed
fixedly
into
the
darkness
a
secret
smile
parted
her
lips
seen
by
none
but
she
quickly
shook
her
head
and
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
neck
and
again
her
former
thought
hung
like
a
mist
about
her
Before
morning
she
undressed
and
went
to
bed
but
she
could
not
sleep
The
first
fiery
ray
of
sunlight
fell
upon
her
room
Oh
if
he
loves
me
she
cried
suddenly
and
unabashed
by
the
light
shining
on
her
she
opened
wide
her
arms
She
got
up
dressed
and
went
down
No
one
in
the
house
was
awake
yet
She
went
into
the
garden
but
in
the
garden
it
was
peaceful
green
and
fresh
the
birds
chirped
so
confidingly
and
the
flowers
peeped
out
so
gaily
that
she
could
not
bear
it
Oh
she
thought
if
it
is
true
no
blade
of
grass
is
happy
as
I
But
is
it
true
She
went
back
to
her
room
and
to
kill
time
she
began
changing
her
dress
But
everything
slipped
out
of
her
hands
and
she
was
still
sitting
half-dressed
before
her
looking-glass
when
she
was
summoned
to
morning
tea
She
went
down
her
mother
noticed
her
pallor
but
only
said
How
interesting
you
are
to-day
and
taking
her
in
in
a
glance
she
added
How
well
that
dress
suits
you
you
should
always
put
it
on
when
you
want
to
make
an
impression
on
any
one
Elena
made
no
reply
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
Meanwhile
it
struck
nine
o
clock
there
were
only
two
haurs
now
till
eleven
Elena
tried
to
read
then
to
sew
then
to
read
again
then
she
vowed
to
herself
to
walk
a
hundred
times
up
and
down
one
alley
and
paced
it
a
hundred
times
then
for
a
long
time
she
watched
Anna
Vassilyevna
laying
out
the
cards
for
patience
and
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
not
yet
ten
Shubin
came
into
the
drawing-room
She
tried
to
talk
to
him
and
begged
his
pardon
what
for
she
did
not
know
herself
Every
word
she
uttered
did
not
cost
her
effort
exactly
but
roused
a
kind
of
amazement
in
herself
Shubin
bent
over
her
She
expected
ridicule
raised
her
eyes
and
saw
before
her
a
sorrowful
and
sympathetic
face
She
smiled
at
this
face
Shubin
too
smiled
at
her
without
speaking
and
gently
left
her
She
tried
to
keep
him
but
could
not
at
once
remember
what
to
call
him
At
last
it
struck
eleven
Then
she
began
to
wait
to
wait
and
to
listen
She
could
do
nothing
now
she
ceased
even
to
think
Her
heart
was
stirred
into
life
again
and
began
beating
louder
and
louder
and
strange
to
say
the
time
seemed
flying
by
A
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
then
half
an
hour
a
few
minutes
more
as
Elena
thought
had
passed
when
suddenly
she
started
the
clock
had
struck
not
twelve
but
one
He
is
not
coming
he
is
going
away
without
saying
good-bye
The
blood
rushed
to
her
head
with
this
thought
She
felt
that
she
was
gasping
for
breath
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
sobbing
She
ran
to
her
own
room
and
fell
with
her
face
in
her
clasped
hands
on
to
the
bed
For
half
an
hour
she
lay
motionless
the
tears
flowed
through
her
fingers
on
to
the
pillow
Suddenly
she
raised
herself
and
sat
up
something
strange
was
passing
in
her
her
face
changed
her
wet
eyes
grew
dry
and
shining
her
brows
were
bent
and
her
lips
compressed
Another
half-hour
passed
Elena
for
the
last
time
strained
her
ears
to
listen
was
not
that
the
familiar
voice
floating
up
to
her
She
got
up
put
on
her
hat
and
gloves
threw
a
cape
over
her
shoulders
and
slipping
unnoticed
out
of
the
house
she
went
with
swift
steps
along
the
road
leading
to
Bersenyev
s
lodging
Elena
walked
with
her
head
bent
and
her
eyes
fixed
straight
before
her
She
feared
nothing
she
considered
nothing
she
wanted
to
see
Insarov
once
more
She
went
on
not
noticing
that
the
sun
had
long
ago
disappeared
behind
heavy
black
clouds
that
the
wind
was
roaring
by
gusts
in
the
trees
and
blowing
her
dress
about
her
that
the
dust
had
suddenly
risen
and
was
flying
in
a
cloud
along
the
road
Large
drops
of
rain
were
falling
she
did
not
even
notice
it
but
it
fell
faster
and
heavier
there
were
flashes
of
lightning
and
peals
of
thunder
Elena
stood
still
looking
round
Fortunately
for
her
there
was
a
little
old
broken-down
chapel
that
had
been
built
over
a
disused
well
not
far
from
the
place
where
she
was
overtaken
by
the
storm
She
ran
to
it
and
got
under
the
low
roof
The
rain
fell
in
torrents
the
sky
was
completely
overcast
In
dumb
despair
Elena
stared
at
the
thick
network
of
fast-falling
drops
Her
last
hope
of
getting
a
sight
of
Insarov
was
vanishing
A
little
old
beggar-woman
came
into
the
chapel
shook
herself
said
with
a
curtsy
Out
of
the
rain
good
lady
and
with
many
sighs
and
groans
sat
down
on
a
ledge
near
the
well
Elena
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
the
old
woman
noticed
this
action
and
a
light
came
into
her
face
yellow
and
wrinkled
now
though
once
handsome
Thank
you
dear
gracious
lady
she
was
beginning
There
happened
to
be
no
purse
in
Elena
s
pocket
but
the
old
woman
was
still
holding
out
her
hand
I
have
no
money
grannie
said
Elena
but
here
take
this
it
will
be
of
use
for
something
She
gave
her
her
handkerchief
O-oh
my
pretty
lady
said
the
beggar
what
do
you
give
your
handkerchief
to
me
for
For
a
wedding-present
to
my
grandchild
when
she
s
married
God
reward
you
for
your
goodness
A
peal
of
thunder
was
heard
Lord
Jesus
Christ
muttered
the
beggar-woman
and
she
crossed
herself
three
times
Why
haven
t
I
seen
you
before
she
added
after
a
brief
pause
Didn
t
you
give
me
alms
in
Christ
s
name
Elena
looked
more
attentively
at
the
old
woman
and
recognised
her
Yes
grannie
she
answered
wasn
t
it
you
asked
me
why
I
was
so
sorrowful
Yes
darling
yes
I
fancied
I
knew
you
And
I
think
you
ve
a
heart-ache
still
You
seem
in
trouble
now
Here
s
your
handkerchief
too
wet
from
tears
to
be
sure
Oh
you
young
people
you
all
have
the
same
sorrow
a
terrible
woe
it
is
What
sorrow
grannie
Ah
my
good
young
lady
you
can
t
deceive
an
old
woman
like
me
I
know
what
your
heart
is
heavy
over
your
sorrow
s
not
an
uncommon
one
Sure
I
have
been
young
too
darling
I
have
been
through
that
trouble
too
Yes
And
I
ll
tell
you
something
for
your
goodness
to
me
you
ve
won
a
good
man
not
a
light
of
love
you
cling
to
him
alone
cling
to
him
stronger
than
death
If
it
comes
off
it
comes
off
if
not
it
s
in
God
s
hands
Yes
Why
are
you
wondering
at
me
I
m
a
fortune-teller
There
I
ll
carry
away
your
sorrow
with
your
handkerchief
I
ll
carry
it
away
and
it
s
over
See
the
rain
s
less
you
wait
a
little
longer
It
s
not
the
first
time
I
ve
been
wet
Remember
darling
you
had
a
sorrow
the
sorrow
has
flown
and
there
s
no
memory
of
it
Good
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
The
beggar-woman
got
up
from
the
edge
of
the
well
went
out
of
the
chapel
and
stole
off
on
her
way
Elena
stared
after
her
in
bewilderment
What
does
this
mean
she
murmured
involuntarily
The
rain
grew
less
and
less
the
sun
peeped
out
for
an
instant
Elena
was
just
preparing
to
leave
her
shelter
Suddenly
ten
paces
from
the
chapel
she
saw
Insarov
Wrapt
in
a
cloak
he
was
walking
along
the
very
road
by
which
Elena
had
come
he
seemed
to
be
hurrying
home
She
clasped
the
old
rail
of
the
steps
for
support
and
tried
to
call
to
him
but
her
voice
failed
her
Insarov
had
already
passed
by
without
raising
his
head
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
she
said
at
last
Insarov
stopped
abruptly
looked
round
For
the
first
minute
he
did
not
know
Elena
but
he
went
up
to
her
at
once
You
you
here
he
cried
She
walked
back
in
silence
into
the
chapel
Insarov
followed
Elena
You
here
he
repeated
She
was
still
silent
and
only
gazed
upon
him
with
a
strange
slow
tender
look
He
dropped
his
eyes
You
have
come
from
our
house
she
asked
No
not
from
your
house
No
repeated
Elena
and
she
tried
to
smile
Is
that
how
you
keep
your
promises
I
have
been
expecting
you
ever
since
the
morning
I
made
no
promise
yesterday
if
you
remember
Elena
Nikolaevna
Again
Elena
faintly
smiled
and
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
face
Both
face
and
hands
were
very
white
You
meant
then
to
go
away
without
saying
good-bye
to
us
Yes
replied
Insarov
in
a
surly
thick
voice
What
After
our
friendship
after
the
talks
after
everything
Then
if
I
had
not
met
you
here
by
chance
Elena
s
voice
began
to
break
and
she
paused
an
instant
you
would
have
gone
away
like
that
without
even
shaking
hands
for
the
last
time
and
you
would
not
have
cared
Insarov
turned
away
Elena
Nikolaevnas
don
t
talk
like
that
please
I
m
not
over
happy
as
it
is
Believe
me
my
decision
has
cost
me
great
effort
If
you
knew
I
don
t
want
to
know
Elena
interposed
with
dismay
why
you
are
going
It
seems
it
s
necessary
It
seems
we
must
part
You
would
not
wound
your
friends
without
good
reason
But
can
friends
part
like
this
And
we
are
friends
aren
t
we
No
said
Insarov
What
murmured
Elena
Her
cheeks
were
overspread
with
a
faint
flush
That
s
just
why
I
am
going
away
because
we
are
not
friends
Don
t
force
me
into
saying
what
I
don
t
want
to
say
and
what
I
won
t
say
You
used
to
be
so
open
with
me
said
Elena
rather
reproachfully
Do
you
remember
I
used
to
be
able
to
be
open
then
I
had
nothing
to
conceal
but
now
But
now
queried
Elena
But
now
now
I
must
go
away
Goodbye
If
at
that
instant
Insarov
had
lifted
his
eyes
to
Elena
he
would
have
seen
that
her
face
grew
brighter
and
brighter
as
he
frowned
and
looked
gloomy
but
he
kept
his
eyes
obstinately
fixed
on
the
ground
Well
good-bye
Dmitri
Nikanorovitch
she
began
But
at
least
since
we
have
met
give
me
your
hand
now
Insarov
was
stretching
out
his
hand
No
I
can
t
even
do
that
he
said
and
turned
away
again
You
can
t
No
I
can
t
Good-bye
And
he
moved
away
to
the
entrance
of
the
chapel
Wait
a
little
longer
said
Elena
You
seem
afraid
of
me
But
I
am
braver
than
you
she
added
a
faint
tremor
passing
suddenly
over
her
whole
body
I
can
tell
you
shall
I
how
it
was
you
found
me
here
Do
you
know
where
I
was
going
Insarov
looked
in
bewilderment
at
Elena
I
was
going
to
you
To
me
Elena
hid
her
face
You
mean
to
force
me
to
say
that
I
love
you
she
whispered
There
I
have
said
it
Elena
cried
Insarov
She
took
his
hands
looked
at
him
and
fell
on
his
breast
He
held
her
close
to
him
and
said
nothing
There
was
no
need
for
him
to
tell
her
he
loved
her
From
that
cry
alone
from
the
instant
transformation
of
the
whole
man
from
the
heaving
of
the
breast
to
which
she
clung
so
confidingly
from
the
touch
of
his
finger
tips
in
her
hair
Elena
could
feel
that
she
was
loved
He
did
not
speak
and
she
needed
no
words
He
is
here
he
loves
me
what
need
of
more
The
peace
of
perfect
bliss
the
peace
of
the
harbour
reached
after
storm
of
the
end
attained
that
heavenly
peace
which
gives
significance
and
beauty
even
to
death
filled
her
with
its
divine
flood
She
desired
nothing
for
she
had
gained
all
O
my
brother
my
friend
my
dear
one
her
lips
were
whispering
while
she
did
not
know
whose
was
this
heart
his
or
her
own
which
beat
so
blissfully
and
melted
against
her
bosom
He
stood
motionless
folding
in
his
strong
embrace
the
young
life
surrendered
to
him
he
felt
against
his
heart
this
new
infinitely
precious
burden
a
passion
of
tenderness
of
gratitude
unutterable
was
crumbling
his
hard
will
to
dust
and
tears
unknown
till
now
stood
in
his
eyes
She
did
not
weep
she
could
only
repeat
O
my
friend
my
brother
So
you
will
follow
me
everywhere
he
said
to
her
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
still
enfolding
her
and
keeping
her
close
to
him
in
his
arms
Everywhere
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
Where
you
are
I
will
be
And
you
are
not
deceiving
yourself
you
know
your
parents
will
never
consent
to
our
marriage
I
don
t
deceive
myself
I
know
that
You
know
that
I
m
poor
almost
a
beggar
I
know
That
I
m
not
a
Russian
that
it
won
t
be
my
fate
to
live
in
Russia
that
you
will
have
to
break
all
your
ties
with
your
country
with
your
people
I
know
I
know
Do
you
know
too
that
I
have
given
myself
up
to
a
difficult
thankless
cause
that
I
that
we
shall
have
to
expose
ourselves
not
to
dangers
only
but
to
privation
humiliation
perhaps
I
know
I
know
all
I
love
you
That
you
will
have
to
give
up
all
you
are
accustomed
to
that
out
there
alone
among
strangers
you
will
be
forced
perhaps
to
work
She
laid
her
hand
on
his
lips
I
love
you
my
dear
one
He
began
hotly
kissing
her
slender
rosy
hand
Elena
did
not
draw
it
away
from
his
lips
and
with
a
kind
of
childish
delight
with
smiling
curiosity
watched
how
he
covered
with
kisses
first
the
palm
then
the
fingers
All
at
once
she
blushed
and
hid
her
face
upon
his
breast
He
lifted
her
head
tenderly
and
looked
steadily
into
her
eyes
Welcome
then
my
wife
before
God
and
men
An
hour
later
Elena
with
her
hat
in
one
hand
her
cape
in
the
other
walked
slowly
into
the
drawing-room
of
the
villa
Her
hair
was
in
slight
disorder
on
each
cheek
was
to
be
seen
a
small
bright
spot
of
colour
the
smile
would
not
leave
her
lips
her
eyes
were
nearly
shutting
and
half
hidden
under
the
lids
they
too
were
smiling
She
could
scarcely
move
for
weariness
and
this
weariness
was
pleasant
to
her
everything
indeed
was
pleasant
to
her
Everything
seemed
sweet
and
friendly
to
her
Uvar
Ivanovitch
was
sitting
at
the
window
she
went
up
to
him
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
stretched
a
little
and
involuntarily
as
it
seemed
she
laughed
What
is
it
he
inquired
astonished
She
did
not
know
what
to
say
She
felt
inclined
to
kiss
Uvar
Ivanovitch
How
he
splashed
she
explained
at
last
But
Uvar
Ivanovitch
did
not
stir
a
muscle
and
continued
to
look
with
amazement
at
Elena
She
dropped
her
hat
and
cape
on
to
him
Dear
Uvar
Ivanovitch
she
said
I
am
sleepy
and
tired
and
again
she
laughed
and
sank
into
a
low
chair
near
him
H
m
grunted
Uvar
Ivanovitch
flourishing
his
fingers
then
you
ought
yes
Elena
was
looking
round
her
and
thinking
From
all
this
I
soon
must
part
and
strange
I
have
no
dread
no
doubt
no
regret
No
I
am
sorry
for
mamma
Then
the
little
chapel
rose
again
before
her
mind
again
her
voice
was
echoing
in
it
and
she
felt
his
arms
about
her
Joyously
though
faintly
her
heart
fluttered
weighed
down
by
the
languor
of
happiness
The
old
beggar-woman
recurred
to
her
mind
She
did
really
bear
away
my
sorrow
she
thought
Oh
how
happy
I
am
how
undeservedly
how
soon
If
she
had
let
herself
go
in
the
least
she
would
have
melted
into
sweet
endless
tears
She
could
only
restrain
them
by
laughing
Whatever
attitude
she
fell
into
seemed
to
her
the
easiest
most
comfortable
possible
she
felt
as
if
she
were
being
rocked
to
sleep
All
her
movements
were
slow
and
soft
what
had
become
of
her
awkwardness
her
haste
Zoya
came
in
