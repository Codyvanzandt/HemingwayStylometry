Insarov
were
sitting
alone
together
in
a
dark
box
close
to
the
stage
the
mirthful
mood
which
had
come
upon
them
in
the
academy
delle
Belle
Arti
had
not
yet
passed
off
When
the
father
of
the
unhappy
young
man
who
had
fallen
into
the
snares
of
the
enchantress
came
on
to
the
stage
in
a
yellow
frock-coat
and
a
dishevelled
white
wig
opened
his
mouth
awry
and
losing
his
presence
of
mind
before
he
had
begun
only
brought
out
a
faint
bass
tremolo
they
almost
burst
into
laughter
But
Violetta
s
acting
impressed
them
They
hardly
clap
that
poor
girl
at
all
said
Elena
but
I
like
her
a
thousand
times
better
than
some
conceited
second-rate
celebrity
who
would
grimace
and
attitudinise
all
the
while
for
effect
This
girl
seems
as
though
it
were
all
in
earnest
look
she
pays
no
attention
to
the
public
Insarov
bent
over
the
edge
of
the
box
and
looked
attentively
at
Violetta
Yes
he
commented
she
is
in
earnest
she
s
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
herself
Elena
was
mute
The
third
act
began
The
curtain
rose
Elena
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
the
bed
the
drawn
curtains
the
glass
of
medicine
the
shaded
lamps
She
recalled
the
near
past
What
of
the
future
What
of
the
present
flashed
across
her
mind
As
though
in
response
to
her
thought
the
artist
s
mimic
cough
on
the
stage
was
answered
in
the
box
by
the
hoarse
terribly
real
cough
of
Insarov
Elena
stole
a
glance
at
him
and
at
once
gave
her
features
a
calm
and
untroubled
expression
Insarov
understood
her
and
he
began
himself
to
smile
and
softly
to
hum
the
tune
of
the
song
But
he
was
soon
quiet
Violetta
s
acting
became
steadily
better
and
freer
She
had
thrown
aside
everything
subsidiary
everything
superfluous
and
found
herself
a
rare
a
lofty
delight
for
an
artist
She
had
suddenly
crossed
the
limit
which
it
is
impossible
to
define
beyond
which
is
the
abiding
place
of
beauty
The
audience
was
thrilled
and
astonished
The
plain
girl
with
the
broken
voice
began
to
get
a
hold
on
it
to
master
it
And
the
singer
s
voice
even
did
not
sound
broken
now
it
had
gained
mellowness
and
strength
Alfredo
made
his
entrance
Violetta
s
cry
of
happiness
almost
raised
that
storm
in
the
audience
known
as
fanatisme
beside
which
all
the
applause
of
our
northern
audiences
is
nothing
A
brief
interval
passed
and
again
the
audience
were
in
transports
The
duet
began
the
best
thing
in
the
opera
in
which
the
composer
has
succeeded
in
expressing
all
the
pathos
of
the
senseless
waste
of
youth
the
final
struggle
of
despairing
helpless
love
Caught
up
and
carried
along
by
the
general
sympathy
with
tears
of
artistic
delight
and
real
suffering
in
her
eyes
the
singer
let
herself
be
borne
along
on
the
wave
of
passion
within
her
her
face
was
transfigured
and
in
the
presence
of
the
threatening
signs
of
fast
approaching
death
the
words
Lascia
mi
vivero
morir
si
giovane
let
me
live
to
die
so
young
burst
from
her
in
such
a
tempest
of
prayer
rising
to
heaven
that
the
whole
theatre
shook
with
frenzied
applause
and
shouts
of
delight
Elena
felt
cold
all
over
Softly
her
hand
sought
Insarov
s
found
it
and
clasped
it
tightly
He
responded
to
its
pressure
but
she
did
not
look
at
him
nor
he
at
her
Very
different
was
the
clasp
of
hands
with
which
they
had
greeted
each
other
in
the
gondola
a
few
hours
before
Again
they
glided
along
the
Canal
Grande
towards
their
hotel
Night
had
set
in
now
a
clear
soft
night
The
same
palaces
met
them
but
they
seemed
different
Those
that
were
lighted
up
by
the
moon
shone
with
pale
gold
and
in
this
pale
light
all
details
of
ornaments
and
lines
of
windows
and
balconies
seemed
lost
they
stood
out
more
clearly
in
the
buildings
that
were
wrapped
in
a
light
veil
of
unbroken
shadow
The
gondolas
with
their
little
red
lamps
seemed
to
flit
past
more
noiselessly
and
swiftly
than
ever
their
steel
beaks
flashed
mysteriously
mysteriously
their
oars
rose
and
fell
over
the
ripples
stirred
by
little
silvery
fish
here
and
there
was
heard
the
brief
subdued
call
of
a
gondolier
they
never
sing
now
scarcely
another
sound
was
to
be
heard
The
hotel
where
Insarov
and
Elena
were
staying
was
on
the
Riva
dei
Schiavoni
before
they
reached
it
they
left
the
gondola
and
walked
several
times
round
the
Square
of
St
Mark
under
the
arches
where
numbers
of
holiday
makers
were
gathered
before
the
tiny
cafes
There
is
a
special
sweetness
in
wandering
alone
with
one
you
love
in
a
strange
city
among
strangers
everything
seems
beautiful
and
full
of
meaning
you
feel
peace
and
goodwill
to
all
men
you
wish
all
the
same
happiness
that
fills
your
heart
But
Elena
could
not
now
give
herself
up
without
a
care
to
the
sense
of
her
happiness
her
heart
could
not
regain
its
calm
after
the
emotions
that
had
so
lately
shaken
it
and
Insarov
as
he
walked
by
the
palace
of
the
Doges
pointed
without
speaking
to
the
mouths
of
the
Austrian
cannons
peeping
out
from
the
lower
arches
and
pulled
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
By
now
he
felt
tired
and
with
a
last
glance
at
the
church
of
St
Mark
at
its
cupola
where
on
the
bluish
lead
bright
patches
of
phosphorescent
light
shone
in
the
rays
of
the
moon
they
turned
slowly
homewards
Their
little
room
looked
out
on
to
the
lagoon
which
stretches
from
the
Riva
del
Schiavoni
to
the
Giudecca
Almost
facing
their
hotel
rose
the
slender
tower
of
S
George
high
against
the
sky
on
the
right
shone
the
golden
ball
of
the
Customs
House
and
decked
like
a
bride
stood
the
loveliest
of
the
churches
the
Redentore
of
Palladio
on
the
left
were
the
black
masts
and
rigging
of
ships
the
funnels
of
steamers
a
half-furled
sail
hung
in
one
place
like
a
great
wing
and
the
flags
scarcely
stirred
Insarov
sat
down
at
the
window
but
Elena
did
not
let
him
admire
the
view
for
long
he
seemed
suddenly
feverish
he
was
overcome
by
consuming
weakness
She
put
him
to
bed
and
waiting
till
he
had
fallen
asleep
she
returned
to
the
window
Oh
how
still
and
kindly
was
the
night
what
dovelike
softness
breathed
in
the
deep-blue
air
Every
suffering
every
sorrow
surely
must
be
soothed
to
slumber
under
that
clear
sky
under
that
pure
holy
light
O
God
thought
Elena
why
must
there
be
death
why
is
there
separation
and
disease
and
tears
or
else
why
this
beauty
this
sweet
feeling
of
hope
this
soothing
sense
of
an
abiding
refuge
an
unchanging
support
an
everlasting
protection
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
smiling
blessing
sky
this
happy
sleeping
earth
Can
it
be
that
all
that
is
only
in
us
and
that
outside
us
is
eternal
cold
and
silence
Can
it
be
that
we
are
alone
alone
and
there
on
all
sides
in
all
those
unattainable
depths
and
abysses
nothing
is
akin
to
us
all
all
is
strange
and
apart
from
us
Why
then
have
we
this
desire
for
this
delight
in
prayer
Morir
si
giovane
was
echoing
in
her
heart
Is
it
impossible
then
to
propitiate
to
avert
to
save
O
God
is
it
impossible
to
believe
in
miracle
She
dropped
her
head
on
to
her
clasped
hands
Enough
she
whispered
Indeed
enough
I
have
been
happy
not
for
moments
only
not
for
hours
not
for
whole
days
even
but
for
whole
weeks
together
And
what
right
had
I
to
happiness
She
felt
terror
at
the
thought
of
her
happiness
What
if
that
can
not
be
she
thought
What
if
it
is
not
granted
for
nothing
Why
it
has
been
heaven
and
we
are
mortals
poor
sinful
mortals
Morir
si
giovane
Oh
dark
omen
away
It
s
not
only
for
me
his
life
is
needed
But
what
if
it
is
a
punishment
she
thought
again
what
if
we
must
now
pay
the
penalty
of
our
guilt
in
full
My
conscience
was
silent
it
is
silent
now
but
is
that
a
proof
of
innocence
O
God
can
we
be
so
guilty
Canst
Thou
who
hast
created
this
night
this
sky
wish
to
punish
us
for
having
loved
each
other
If
it
be
so
if
he
has
sinned
if
I
have
sinned
she
added
with
involuntary
force
grant
that
he
O
God
grant
that
we
both
may
die
at
least
a
noble
glorious
death
there
on
the
plains
of
his
country
not
here
in
this
dark
room
And
the
grief
of
my
poor
lonely
mother
she
asked
herself
and
was
bewildered
and
could
find
no
answer
to
her
question
Elena
did
not
know
that
every
man
s
happiness
is
built
on
the
unhappiness
of
another
that
even
his
advantage
his
comfort
like
a
statue
needs
a
pedestal
the
disadvantage
the
discomfort
of
others
Renditch
muttered
Insarov
in
his
sleep
Elena
went
up
to
him
on
tiptoe
bent
over
him
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
He
tossed
a
little
on
his
pillow
and
was
still
again
She
went
back
again
to
the
window
and
again
her
thoughts
took
possession
of
her
She
began
to
argue
with
herself
to
assure
herself
that
there
was
no
reason
to
be
afraid
She
even
began
to
feel
ashamed
of
her
weakness
Is
there
any
danger
isn
t
he
better
she
murmured
Why
if
we
had
not
been
at
the
theatre
to-day
all
this
would
never
have
entered
my
head
At
that
instant
she
saw
high
above
the
water
a
white
sea-gull
some
fisherman
had
scared
it
it
seemed
for
it
flew
noiselessly
with
uncertain
course
as
though
seeking
a
spot
where
it
could
alight
Come
if
it
flies
here
thought
Elena
it
will
be
a
good
omen
The
sea-gull
flew
round
in
a
circle
folded
its
wings
and
as
though
it
had
been
shot
dropped
with
a
plaintive
cry
in
the
distance
behind
a
dark
ship
Elena
shuddered
then
she
was
ashamed
of
having
shuddered
and
without
undressing
she
lay
down
on
the
bed
beside
Insarov
who
was
breathing
quickly
and
heavily
Insarov
waked
late
with
a
dull
pain
in
his
head
and
a
feeling
as
he
expressed
it
of
disgusting
weakness
all
over
He
got
up
however
Renditch
has
not
come
was
his
first
question
Not
yet
answered
Elena
and
she
handed
him
the
latest
number
of
the
Osservatore
Triestino
in
which
there
was
much
upon
the
war
the
Slav
Provinces
and
the
Principalities
Insarov
began
reading
it
she
busied
herself
in
getting
some
coffee
ready
for
him
Some
one
knocked
at
the
door
Renditch
both
thought
at
once
but
a
voice
said
in
Russian
May
I
come
in
Elena
and
Insarov
looked
at
each
other
in
astonishment
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
an
elegantly
dressed
young
man
entered
the
room
with
a
small
sharp-featured
face
and
bright
little
eyes
He
was
beaming
all
over
as
though
he
had
just
won
a
fortune
or
heard
a
most
delightful
piece
of
news
Insarov
got
up
from
his
seat
You
don
t
recognise
me
began
the
stranger
going
up
to
him
with
an
easy
air
and
bowing
politely
to
Elena
Lupoyarov
do
you
remember
we
met
at
Moscow
at
the
E
s
Yes
at
the
E
s
replied
Insarov
To
be
sure
to
be
sure
I
beg
you
to
present
me
to
your
wife
Madam
I
have
always
had
the
profoundest
respect
for
Dmitri
Vassilyevitch
he
corrected
himself
for
Nikanor
Vassilyevitch
and
am
very
happy
to
have
the
pleasure
at
last
of
making
your
acquaintance
Fancy
he
continued
turning
to
Insarov
I
only
heard
yesterday
evening
that
you
were
here
I
am
staying
at
this
hotel
too
What
a
city
Venice
is
poetry
that
s
the
only
word
for
it
But
one
thing
s
really
awful
the
cursed
Austrians
meeting
one
at
every
turn
ah
these
Austrians
By
the
way
have
you
heard
there
s
been
a
decisive
battle
on
the
Danube
three
hundred
Turkish
officers
killed
Silistria
taken
Servia
has
declared
its
independence
You
as
a
patriot
ought
to
be
in
transports
oughtn
t
you
Even
my
Slavonic
blood
s
positively
on
fire
I
advise
you
to
be
more
careful
though
I
m
convinced
there
s
a
watch
kept
on
you
The
spies
here
are
something
awful
A
suspicious-looking
man
came
up
to
me
yesterday
and
asked
Are
you
a
Russian
I
told
him
I
was
a
Dane
But
you
seem
unwell
dear
Nikanor
Vassilyevitch
You
ought
to
see
a
doctor
madam
you
ought
to
make
your
husband
see
a
doctor
Yesterday
I
ran
through
the
palaces
and
churches
as
though
I
were
crazy
I
suppose
you
ve
been
in
the
palace
of
the
Doges
What
magnificence
everywhere
Especially
that
great
hall
and
Marino
Faliero
s
place
there
s
an
inscription
decapitati
pro
criminibus
I
ve
been
in
the
famous
prisons
too
that
threw
me
into
indignation
you
may
fancy
I
ve
always
you
remember
perhaps
taken
an
interest
in
social
questions
and
taken
sides
against
aristocracy
well
that
s
where
I
should
like
to
send
the
champions
of
aristocracy
to
those
dungeons
How
well
Byron
said
I
stood
in
Venice
on
the
Bridge
of
Sighs
though
he
was
an
aristocrat
too
I
was
always
for
progress
the
younger
generation
are
all
for
progress
And
what
do
you
say
to
the
Anglo-French
business
We
shall
see
whether
they
can
do
much
Boustrapa
and
Palmerston
You
know
Palmerston
has
been
made
Prime
Minister
No
say
what
you
like
the
Russian
fist
is
not
to
be
despised
He
s
awfully
deep
that
Boustrapa
If
you
like
I
will
lend
you
Les
Chatiments
de
Victor
Hugo
it
s
marvellous
L
avenir
le
gendarme
de
Dieu
rather
boldly
written
but
what
force
in
it
what
force
That
was
a
fine
saying
too
of
Prince
Vyazemsky
s
Europe
repeats
Bash-Kadik-Lar
keeping
an
eye
on
Sinope
I
adore
poetry
I
have
Proudhon
s
last
work
too
I
have
everything
I
don
t
know
how
you
feel
but
I
m
glad
of
the
war
only
as
I
m
not
required
at
home
I
m
going
from
here
to
Florence
and
to
Rome
France
I
can
t
go
to
so
I
m
thinking
of
Spain
the
women
there
I
m
told
are
marvellous
only
such
poverty
and
so
many
insects
I
would
be
off
to
California
we
Russians
are
ready
to
do
anything
but
I
promised
an
editor
to
study
the
question
of
the
commerce
of
the
Mediterranean
in
detail
You
will
say
that
s
an
uninteresting
special
subject
but
that
s
just
what
we
need
specialists
we
have
philosophised
enough
now
we
need
the
practical
the
practical
But
you
are
very
unwell
Nikanor
Vassilyevitch
I
am
tiring
you
perhaps
but
still
I
must
stay
a
little
longer
And
for
a
long
time
Lupoyarov
still
babbled
on
in
the
same
way
and
as
he
went
away
he
promised
to
come
again
Worn
out
by
the
unexpected
visit
Insarov
lay
down
on
the
sofa
So
this
he
said
mournfully
looking
at
Elena
is
your
younger
generation
There
are
plenty
who
show
off
and
give
themselves
airs
while
at
heart
they
are
as
empty
chatterboxes
as
that
worthy
Elena
made
no
reply
to
her
husband
at
that
instant
she
was
far
more
concerned
at
Insarov
s
weakness
than
at
the
character
of
the
whole
younger
generation
in
Russia
She
sat
down
near
him
and
took
up
some
work
He
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
without
moving
white
and
thin
Elena
glanced
at
his
sharp
profile
at
his
emaciated
hands
and
felt
a
sudden
pang
of
terror
Dmitri
she
began
He
started
Eh
Has
Renditch
come
Not
yet
but
what
do
you
think
you
are
in
a
fever
you
are
really
not
quite
well
shouldn
t
we
send
for
a
doctor
That
wretched
gossip
has
frightened
you
There
s
no
necessity
I
will
rest
a
little
and
it
will
pass
off
After
dinner
we
will
go
out
again
somewhere
Two
hours
passed
Insarov
still
lay
on
the
sofa
but
he
could
not
sleep
though
he
did
not
open
his
eyes
Elena
did
not
leave
his
side
she
had
dropped
her
work
upon
her
knee
and
did
not
stir
Why
don
t
you
go
to
sleep
she
asked
at
last
Wait
a
little
He
took
her
hand
and
placed
it
under
his
head
There
that
is
nice
Wake
me
at
once
directly
Renditch
comes
If
he
says
the
ship
is
ready
we
will
start
at
once
We
ought
to
pack
everything
Packing
won
t
take
long
answered
Elena
That
fellow
babbled
something
about
a
battle
about
Servia
said
Insarov
after
a
short
interval
I
suppose
he
made
it
all
up
But
we
must
we
must
start
We
can
t
lose
time
Be
ready
He
fell
asleep
and
everything
was
still
in
the
room
Elena
let
her
head
rest
against
the
back
of
her
chair
and
gazed
a
long
while
out
of
the
window
The
weather
had
changed
for
the
worse
the
wind
had
risen
Great
white
clouds
were
scudding
over
the
sky
a
slender
mast
was
swaying
in
the
distance
a
long
streamer
with
a
red
cross
on
it
kept
fluttering
falling
and
fluttering
again
The
pendulum
of
the
old-fashioned
clock
ticked
drearily
with
a
kind
of
melancholy
whirr
Elena
shut
her
eyes
She
had
slept
badly
all
night
gradually
she
too
fell
asleep
She
had
a
strange
dream
She
thought
sha
was
floating
in
a
boat
on
the
Tsaritsino
lake
with
some
unknown
people
They
did
not
speak
but
sat
motionless
no
one
was
rowing
the
boat
was
moving
by
itself
Elena
was
not
afraid
but
she
felt
dreary
she
wanted
to
know
who
were
these
people
and
why
she
was
with
them
She
looked
and
the
lake
grew
broader
the
banks
vanished
now
it
was
not
a
lake
but
a
stormy
sea
immense
blue
silent
waves
rocked
the
boat
majestically
something
menacing
roaring
was
rising
from
the
depths
her
unknown
companions
jumped
up
shrieking
wringing
their
hands
Elena
recognised
their
faces
her
father
was
among
them
But
a
kind
of
white
whirlwind
came
flying
over
the
waves
everything
was
turning
round
everything
was
confounded
together
Elena
looked
about
her
as
before
all
around
was
white
but
it
was
snow
snow
boundless
plains
of
snow
And
she
was
not
now
in
a
boat
but
travelling
as
she
had
come
from
Moscow
in
a
sledge
she
was
not
alone
by
her
side
was
sitting
a
little
creature
muffled
in
an
old
cloak
Elena
looked
closely
it
was
Katya
her
poor
little
friend
Elena
was
seized
with
terror
Why
isn
t
she
dead
she
thought
Katya
where
are
we
going
together
Katya
did
not
answer
and
nestled
herself
closer
in
her
little
cloak
she
was
freezing
Elena
too
was
cold
she
looked
along
the
road
into
the
distance
far
away
a
town
could
be
seen
through
the
fine
drifting
snow
High
white
towers
with
silvery
cupolas
Katya
Katya
is
it
Moscow
No
thought
Elena
it
is
Solovetsky
Monastery
it
s
full
of
little
narrow
cells
like
a
beehive
it
s
stifling
cramping
there
and
Dmitri
s
shut
up
there
I
must
rescue
him
Suddenly
a
grey
yawning
abyss
opened
before
her
The
sledge
was
falling
Katya
was
laughing
Elena
Elena
came
a
voice
from
the
abyss
Elena
sounded
distinctly
in
her
ears
She
raised
her
head
quickly
turned
round
and
was
stupefied
Insarov
white
as
snow
the
snow
of
her
dream
had
half
risen
from
the
sofa
and
was
staring
at
her
with
large
bright
dreadful
eyes
His
hair
hung
in
disorder
on
his
forehead
and
his
lips
parted
strangely
Horror
mingled
with
an
anguish
of
tenderness
was
expressed
on
his
suddenly
transfigured
face
Elena
he
articulated
I
am
dying
She
fell
with
a
scream
on
her
knees
and
clung
to
his
breast
It
s
all
over
repeated
Insarov
I
m
dying
Good-bye
my
poor
girl
good-bye
my
country
and
he
fell
backwards
on
to
the
sofa
Elena
rushed
out
of
the
room
began
calling
for
help
a
waiter
ran
for
a
doctor
Elena
clung
to
Insarov
At
that
instant
in
the
doorway
appeared
a
broad-shouldered
sunburnt
man
in
a
stout
frieze
coat
and
a
low
oil-skin
hat
He
stood
still
in
bewilderment
Renditch
cried
Elena
it
s
you
Look
for
God
s
sake
he
s
ill
What
s
wrong
Good
God
He
went
out
yesterday
he
was
talking
to
me
just
now
Renditch
said
nothing
and
only
moved
on
one
side
There
slipped
quickly
past
him
a
little
figure
in
a
wig
and
spectacles
it
was
a
doctor
living
in
the
same
hotel
He
went
up
to
Insarov
Signora
he
said
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
the
foreign
gentleman
is
dead
il
Signore
forestiere
e
morte
of
aneurism
in
combination
with
disease
of
the
lungs
The
next
day
in
the
same
room
Renditch
was
standing
at
the
window
before
him
wrapped
in
a
shawl
sat
Elena
In
the
next
room
Insarov
lay
in
his
coffin
Elena
s
face
was
both
scared
and
lifeless
two
lines
could
be
seen
on
her
forehead
between
her
eyebrows
they
gave
a
strained
expression
to
her
fixed
eyes
In
the
window
lay
an
open
letter
from
Anna
Vassilyevna
She
begged
her
daughter
to
come
to
Moscow
if
only
for
a
month
complained
of
her
loneliness
and
of
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
sent
greetings
to
Insarov
inquired
after
his
health
and
begged
him
to
spare
his
wife
Renditch
was
a
Dalmatian
a
sailor
with
whom
Insarov
had
become
acquainted
during
his
wanderings
in
his
own
country
and
whom
he
had
sought
out
in
Venice
He
was
a
dry
gruff
man
full
of
daring
and
devoted
to
the
Slavonic
cause
He
despised
the
Turks
and
hated
the
Austrians
How
long
must
you
remain
at
Venice
Elena
asked
him
in
Italian
And
her
voice
was
as
lifeless
as
her
face
One
day
for
freighting
and
not
to
rouse
suspicions
and
then
straight
to
Zara
I
shall
have
sad
news
for
our
countrymen
They
have
long
been
expecting
him
they
rested
their
hopes
on
him
They
rested
their
hopes
on
him
Elena
repeated
mechanically
When
will
you
bury
him
asked
Renditch
Elena
not
at
once
replied
To-morrow
To-morrow
I
will
stop
I
should
like
to
throw
a
handful
of
earth
into
his
grave
And
you
will
want
help
But
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
to
lie
in
Slavonic
earth
Elena
looked
at
Renditch
Captain
she
said
take
me
and
him
and
carry
us
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
sea
away
from
here
Isn
t
that
possible
Renditch
considered
Possible
certainly
but
difficult
We
shall
have
to
come
into
collision
with
the
damned
authorities
here
But
supposing
we
arrange
all
that
and
bury
him
there
how
am
I
to
bring
you
back
You
need
not
bring
me
back
What
where
will
you
stop
I
shall
find
some
place
for
myself
only
take
us
take
me
Renditch
scratched
the
back
of
his
head
You
know
best
but
it
s
all
very
difficult
I
will
I
will
try
and
you
expect
me
here
in
two
hours
time
He
went
away
Elena
passed
into
the
next
room
leaned
against
the
wall
and
for
a
long
time
stood
there
as
though
turned
to
stone
Then
she
dropped
on
her
knees
but
she
could
not
pray
There
was
no
reproach
in
her
heart
she
did
not
dare
to
question
God
s
will
to
ask
why
He
had
not
spared
pitied
saved
why
He
had
punished
her
beyond
her
guilt
if
she
were
guilty
Each
of
us
is
guilty
by
the
fact
that
he
lives
and
there
is
no
one
so
great
a
thinker
so
great
a
benefactor
of
mankind
that
he
might
hope
to
have
a
right
to
live
for
the
service
he
has
done
Still
Elena
could
not
pray
she
was
a
stone
The
same
night
a
broad-bottomed
boat
put
off
from
the
hotel
where
the
Insarovs
lived
In
the
boat
sat
Elena
with
Renditch
and
beside
them
stood
a
long
box
covered
with
a
black
cloth
They
rowed
for
about
an
hour
and
at
last
reached
a
small
two-masted
ship
which
was
riding
at
anchor
at
the
very
entrance
of
the
harbour
Elena
and
Renditch
got
into
the
ship
the
sailors
carried
in
the
box
At
midnight
a
storm
had
arisen
but
early
in
the
morning
the
ship
had
passed
out
of
the
Lido
During
the
day
the
storm
raged
with
fearful
violence
and
experienced
seamen
in
Lloyd
s
offices
shook
their
heads
and
prophesied
no
good
The
Adriatic
Sea
between
Venice
Trieste
and
the
Dalmatian
coast
is
particularly
dangerous
Three
weeks
after
Elena
s
departure
from
Vienna
Anna
Vassilyevna
received
the
following
letter
in
Moscow
My
DEAR
PARENTS
I
am
saying
goodbye
to
you
for
ever
You
will
never
see
me
again
Dmitri
died
yesterday
Everything
is
over
for
me
To-day
I
am
setting
off
with
his
body
to
Zara
I
will
bury
him
and
what
will
become
of
me
I
don
t
know
But
now
I
have
no
country
but
Dmitri
s
country
There
they
are
preparing
for
revolution
they
are
getting
ready
for
war
I
will
join
the
Sisters
of
Mercy
I
will
tend
the
sick
and
the
wounded
I
don
t
know
what
will
become
of
me
but
even
after
Dmitri
s
death
I
will
be
faithful
to
his
memory
to
the
work
of
his
whole
life
I
have
learnt
Bulgarian
and
Servian
Very
likely
I
shall
not
have
strength
to
live
through
it
all
for
long
so
much
the
better
I
have
been
brought
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
I
must
fall
over
Fate
did
not
bring
us
together
for
nothing
who
knows
perhaps
I
killed
him
now
it
is
his
turn
to
draw
me
after
him
I
sought
happiness
and
I
shall
find
perhaps
death
It
seems
it
was
to
be
thus
it
seems
it
was
a
sin
But
death
covers
all
and
reconciles
all
does
it
not
Forgive
me
all
the
suffering
I
have
caused
you
it
was
not
under
my
control
But
how
could
I
return
to
Russia
What
have
I
to
do
in
Russia
Accept
my
last
kisses
and
blessings
and
do
not
condemn
me
R
Nearly
five
years
have
passed
since
then
and
no
further
news
of
Elena
has
come
All
letters
and
inquiries
were
fruitless
in
vain
did
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
himself
make
a
journey
to
Venice
and
to
Zara
after
peace
was
concluded
In
Venice
he
learnt
what
is
already
known
to
the
reader
but
in
Zara
no
one
could
give
him
any
positive
information
about
Renditch
and
the
ship
he
had
taken
There
were
dark
rumours
that
some
years
back
after
a
great
storm
the
sea
had
thrown
up
on
shore
a
coffin
in
which
had
been
found
a
man
s
body
But
according
to
other
more
trustworthy
accounts
this
coffin
had
not
been
thrown
up
by
the
sea
at
all
but
had
been
carried
over
and
buried
near
the
shore
by
a
foreign
lady
coming
from
Venice
some
added
that
they
had
seen
this
lady
afterwards
in
Herzegovina
with
the
forces
which
were
there
assembled
they
even
described
her
dress
black
from
head
to
foot
However
it
was
all
trace
of
Elena
had
disappeared
beyond
recovery
for
ever
and
no
one
knows
whether
she
is
still
living
whether
she
is
hidden
away
somewhere
or
whether
the
petty
drama
of
life
is
over
the
little
ferment
of
her
existence
is
at
an
end
and
she
has
found
death
in
her
turn
It
happens
at
times
that
a
man
wakes
up
and
asks
himself
with
involuntary
horror
Can
I
be
already
thirty
forty
fifty
How
is
it
life
has
passed
so
soon
How
is
it
death
has
moved
up
so
close
Death
is
like
a
fisher
who
catches
fish
in
his
net
and
leaves
them
for
a
while
in
the
water
the
fish
is
still
swimming
but
the
net
is
round
him
and
the
fisher
will
draw
him
up
when
he
thinks
fit
What
became
of
the
other
characters
of
our
story
Anna
Vassilyevna
is
still
living
she
has
aged
very
much
since
the
blow
that
has
fallen
on
her
is
less
complaining
but
far
more
wretched
Nikolai
Artemyevitch
too
has
grown
older
and
greyer
and
has
parted
from
Augustina
Christianovna
He
has
taken
now
to
abusing
everything
foreign
His
housekeeper
a
handsome
woman
of
thirty
a
Russian
wears
silk
dresses
and
gold
rings
and
bracelets
Kurnatovsky
like
every
man
of
ardent
temperament
and
dark
complexion
a
devoted
admirer
of
pretty
blondes
married
Zoya
she
is
in
complete
subjection
to
him
and
has
even
given
up
thinking
in
German
Bersenyev
is
in
Heidelberg
he
has
been
sent
abroad
at
the
expense
of
government
he
has
visited
Berlin
and
Paris
and
is
not
wasting
his
time
he
has
become
a
thoroughly
efficient
professor
The
attention
of
the
learned
public
has
been
caught
by
his
two
articles
On
some
peculiarities
of
ancient
law
as
regards
judicial
sentences
and
On
the
significance
of
cities
in
civilisation
It
is
only
a
pity
that
both
articles
are
written
in
rather
a
heavy
style
disfigured
by
foreign
words
Shubin
is
in
Rome
he
is
completely
given
up
to
his
art
and
is
reckoned
one
of
the
most
remarkable
and
promising
of
young
sculptors
Severe
tourists
consider
that
he
has
not
sufficiently
studied
the
antique
that
he
has
no
style
and
reckon
him
one
of
the
French
school
he
has
had
a
great
many
orders
from
the
English
and
Americans
Of
late
there
has
been
much
talk
about
a
Bacchante
of
his
the
Russian
Count
Boboshkin
the
well-known
millionaire
thought
of
buying
it
for
one
thousand
scudi
but
decided
in
preference
to
give
three
thousand
to
another
