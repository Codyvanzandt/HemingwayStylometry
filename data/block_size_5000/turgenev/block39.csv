his
master
's
head
heard
him
relate
how
after
many
fruitless
efforts
and
idle
expeditions
Panteley
Eremyitch
had
at
last
come
to
the
fair
at
Romyon
by
himself
without
the
Jew
Leyba
who
through
weakness
of
character
had
not
persevered
but
had
deserted
him
how
on
the
fifth
day
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
he
walked
for
the
last
time
along
the
rows
of
carts
and
all
at
once
he
saw
between
three
other
horses
fastened
to
the
railings
he
saw
Malek-Adel
How
he
knew
him
at
once
and
how
Malek-Adel
knew
him
too
and
began
neighing
and
dragging
at
his
tether
and
scraping
the
earth
with
his
hoof
'And
he
was
not
with
the
Cossack
Tchertop-hanov
went
on
still
not
turning
his
head
and
in
the
same
bass
voice
'but
with
a
gypsy
horse-dealer
I
of
course
at
once
took
hold
of
my
horse
and
tried
to
get
him
away
by
force
but
the
brute
of
a
gypsy
started
yelling
as
if
he
'd
been
scalded
all
over
the
market
and
began
swearing
he
'd
bought
the
horse
off
another
gypsy
and
wanted
to
bring
witnesses
to
prove
it
I
spat
and
paid
him
the
money
damn
the
fellow
All
I
cared
for
was
that
I
had
found
my
favourite
and
had
got
back
my
peace
of
mind
Moreover
in
the
Karatchevsky
district
I
took
a
man
for
the
Cossack
I
took
the
Jew
Leyba
's
word
for
it
that
he
was
my
thief
and
smashed
his
face
for
him
but
the
Cossack
turned
out
to
be
a
priest
's
son
and
got
damages
out
of
me
a
hundred
and
twenty
roubles
Well
money
's
a
thing
one
may
get
again
but
the
great
thing
is
I
've
Malek-Adel
back
again
I
'm
happy
now
I
'm
going
to
enjoy
myself
in
peace
And
I
've
one
instruction
to
give
you
Perfishka
if
ever
you
which
God
forbid
catch
sight
of
the
Cossack
in
this
neighbourhood
run
the
very
minute
without
saying
a
word
and
bring
me
my
gun
and
I
shall
know
what
to
do
This
was
what
Panteley
Eremyitch
said
to
Perfishka
this
was
how
his
tongue
spoke
but
at
heart
he
was
not
so
completely
at
peace
as
he
declared
Alas
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
was
not
perfectly
convinced
that
the
horse
he
had
brought
back
was
really
Malek-Adel
X
Troubled
times
followed
for
Panteley
Eremyitch
Peace
was
just
the
last
thing
he
enjoyed
He
had
some
happy
days
it
is
true
the
doubt
stirring
within
him
would
seem
to
him
all
nonsense
he
would
drive
away
the
ridiculous
idea
like
a
persistent
fly
and
even
laugh
at
himself
but
he
had
bad
days
too
the
importunate
thought
began
again
stealthily
gnawing
and
tearing
at
his
heart
like
a
mouse
under
the
floor
and
he
existed
in
secret
torture
On
the
memorable
day
when
he
found
Malek-Adel
Tchertop-hanov
had
felt
nothing
but
rapturous
bliss
but
the
next
morning
when
in
a
low-pitched
shed
of
the
inn
he
began
saddling
his
recovered
joy
beside
whom
he
had
spent
the
whole
night
he
felt
for
the
first
time
a
certain
secret
pang
He
only
shook
his
head
but
the
seed
was
sown
During
the
homeward
journey
it
lasted
a
whole
week
doubts
seldom
arose
in
him
they
grew
stronger
and
more
distinct
directly
he
was
back
at
Bezsonovo
directly
he
was
home
again
in
the
place
where
the
old
authentic
Malek-Adel
had
lived
On
the
road
home
he
had
ridden
at
a
quiet
swinging
pace
looking
in
all
directions
smoking
a
short
pipe
and
not
reflecting
at
all
except
at
times
the
thought
struck
him
'When
the
Tchertop-hanovs
want
a
thing
they
get
it
you
bet
and
he
smiled
to
himself
but
on
his
return
home
it
was
a
very
different
state
of
things
All
this
however
he
kept
to
himself
vanity
alone
would
have
prevented
him
from
giving
utterance
to
his
inner
dread
He
would
have
torn
anyone
to
pieces
who
had
dropped
the
most
distant
hint
that
the
new
Malek-Adel
was
possibly
not
the
old
one
he
accepted
congratulations
on
his
'successful
recovery
of
his
horse
from
the
few
persons
whom
he
happened
to
meet
but
he
did
not
seek
such
congratulations
he
avoided
all
contact
with
people
more
than
ever
a
bad
sign
He
was
almost
always
putting
Malek-Adel
through
examinations
if
one
may
use
the
expression
he
would
ride
him
out
to
some
point
at
a
little
distance
in
the
open
country
and
put
him
to
the
proof
or
would
go
stealthily
into
the
stable
lock
the
door
after
him
and
standing
right
before
the
horse
's
head
look
into
his
eyes
and
ask
him
in
a
whisper
'Is
it
you
Is
it
you
You
or
else
stare
at
him
silently
and
intently
for
hours
together
and
then
mutter
brightening
up
'Yes
it
's
he
Of
course
it
's
he
or
else
go
out
with
a
puzzled
even
confused
look
on
his
face
Tchertop-hanov
was
not
so
much
confused
by
the
physical
differences
between
this
Malek-Adel
and
that
one
though
there
were
a
few
such
differences
that
one
's
tail
and
mane
were
a
little
thinner
and
his
ears
more
pointed
and
his
pasterns
shorter
and
his
eyes
brighter
but
all
that
might
be
only
fancy
what
confounded
Tchertop-hanov
most
were
so
to
say
the
moral
differences
The
habits
of
that
one
had
been
different
all
his
ways
were
not
the
same
For
instance
that
Malek-Adel
had
looked
round
and
given
a
faint
neigh
every
time
Tchertop-hanov
went
into
the
stable
while
this
one
went
on
munching
hay
as
though
nothing
had
happened
or
dozed
with
his
head
bent
Both
of
them
stood
still
when
their
master
leaped
out
of
the
saddle
but
that
one
came
at
once
at
his
voice
when
he
was
called
while
this
one
stood
stock
still
That
one
galloped
as
fast
but
with
higher
and
longer
bounds
this
one
went
with
a
freer
step
and
at
a
more
jolting
trot
and
at
times
'wriggled
with
his
shoes
that
is
knocked
the
back
one
against
the
front
one
that
one
had
never
done
anything
so
disgraceful
God
forbid
This
one
it
struck
Tchertop-hanov
kept
twitching
his
ears
in
such
a
stupid
way
while
with
that
one
it
was
quite
the
contrary
he
used
to
lay
one
ear
back
and
hold
it
so
as
though
on
the
alert
for
his
master
That
one
directly
he
saw
that
it
was
dirty
about
him
would
at
once
knock
on
the
partition
of
his
box
with
his
hind-leg
but
this
one
did
not
care
if
the
dung
was
heaped
up
to
his
belly
That
one
if
for
instance
he
were
set
facing
the
wind
would
take
deep
breaths
and
shake
himself
this
one
simply
snorted
that
one
was
put
out
by
the
rain
this
one
cared
nothing
for
it
This
was
a
coarser
beast
coarser
And
there
was
n't
the
gentleness
in
it
and
hard
in
the
mouth
it
was
no
denying
it
That
horse
was
a
darling
but
this
This
was
what
Tchertop-hanov
sometimes
thought
and
very
bitter
were
such
thoughts
to
him
At
other
times
he
would
set
his
horse
at
full
gallop
over
some
newly
ploughed
field
or
would
make
him
leap
down
to
the
very
bottom
of
a
hollow
ravine
and
leap
out
again
at
the
very
steepest
point
and
his
heart
would
throb
with
rapture
a
loud
whoop
would
break
from
his
lips
and
he
would
know
would
know
for
certain
that
it
was
the
real
authentic
Malek-Adel
he
had
under
him
for
what
other
horse
could
do
what
this
one
was
doing
However
there
were
sometimes
shortcomings
and
misfortunes
even
here
The
prolonged
search
for
Malek-Adel
had
cost
Tchertop-hanov
a
great
deal
of
money
he
did
not
even
dream
of
Kostroma
hounds
now
and
rode
about
the
neighbourhood
in
solitude
as
before
So
one
morning
four
miles
from
Bezsonovo
Tchertop-hanov
chanced
to
come
upon
the
same
prince
's
hunting
party
before
whom
he
had
cut
such
a
triumphant
figure
a
year
and
a
half
before
And
as
fate
would
have
it
just
as
on
that
day
a
hare
must
go
leaping
out
from
the
hedge
before
the
dogs
down
the
hillside
Tally-ho
Tally-ho
All
the
hunt
fairly
flew
after
it
and
Tchertop-hanov
flew
along
too
but
not
with
the
rest
of
the
party
but
two
hundred
paces
to
one
side
of
it
just
as
he
had
done
the
time
before
A
huge
watercourse
ran
zigzagging
across
the
hillside
and
as
it
rose
higher
and
higher
got
gradually
narrower
cutting
off
Tchertop-hanov
's
path
At
the
point
where
he
had
to
jump
it
and
where
eighteen
months
before
he
actually
had
jumped
it
it
was
eight
feet
wide
and
fourteen
feet
deep
In
anticipation
of
a
triumph
a
triumph
repeated
in
such
a
delightful
way
Tchertop-hanov
chuckled
exultantly
cracked
his
riding-whip
the
hunting
party
were
galloping
too
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
daring
rider
his
horse
whizzed
along
like
a
bullet
and
now
the
watercourse
was
just
under
his
nose
now
now
at
one
leap
as
then
But
Malek-Adel
pulled
up
sharply
wheeled
to
the
left
and
in
spite
of
Tchertop-hanov's
tugging
him
to
the
edge
to
the
watercourse
he
galloped
along
beside
the
ravine
He
was
afraid
then
did
not
trust
himself
Then
Tchertop-hanov
burning
with
shame
and
wrath
almost
in
tears
dropped
the
reins
and
set
the
horse
going
straight
forward
down
the
hill
away
away
from
the
hunting
party
if
only
not
to
hear
them
jeering
at
him
to
escape
as
soon
as
might
be
from
their
damnable
eyes
Covered
with
foam
his
sides
lashed
unmercifully
Malek-Adel
galloped
home
and
Tchertop-hanov
at
once
locked
himself
into
his
room
'No
it
's
not
he
it
's
not
my
darling
He
would
have
broken
his
neck
before
he
would
have
betrayed
me
What
finally
'did
for
as
they
say
Tchertop-hanov
was
the
following
circumstance
One
day
he
sauntered
riding
on
Malek-Adel
about
the
back-yards
of
the
priest
's
quarters
round
about
the
church
of
the
parish
in
which
is
Bezsonovo
Huddled
up
with
his
Cossack
fur
cap
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
and
his
hands
hanging
loose
on
the
saddle-bow
he
jogged
slowly
on
a
vague
discontent
in
his
heart
Suddenly
someone
called
him
He
stopped
his
horse
raised
his
head
and
saw
his
correspondent
the
deacon
With
a
brown
three-cornered
hat
on
his
brown
hair
which
was
plaited
in
a
pig-tail
attired
in
a
yellowish
nankin
long
coat
girt
much
below
the
waist
by
a
strip
of
blue
stuff
the
servant
of
the
altar
had
come
out
into
his
back-garden
and
catching
sight
of
Panteley
Eremyitch
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
pay
his
respects
to
him
and
to
take
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
to
ask
him
a
question
about
something
Without
some
such
hidden
motive
as
we
know
ecclesiastical
persons
do
not
venture
to
address
temporal
ones
But
Tchertop-hanov
was
in
no
mood
for
the
deacon
he
barely
responded
to
his
bow
and
muttering
something
between
his
teeth
he
was
already
cracking
his
whip
when
'What
a
magnificent
horse
you
have
the
deacon
made
haste
to
add
'and
really
you
can
take
credit
to
yourself
for
it
Truly
you
're
a
man
of
amazing
cleverness
simply
a
lion
indeed
His
reverence
the
deacon
prided
himself
on
his
fluency
which
was
a
great
source
of
vexation
to
his
reverence
the
priest
to
whom
the
gift
of
words
had
not
been
vouchsafed
even
vodka
did
not
loosen
his
tongue
'After
losing
one
animal
by
the
cunning
of
evil
men
continued
the
deacon
'you
did
not
lose
courage
in
repining
but
on
the
other
hand
trusting
the
more
confidently
in
Divine
Providence
procured
yourself
another
in
no
wise
inferior
but
even
one
may
say
superior
since
'What
nonsense
are
you
talking
Tchertop-hanov
interrupted
gloomily
'what
other
horse
do
you
mean
This
is
the
same
one
this
is
Malek-Adel
I
found
him
The
fellow
's
raving
'Ay
ay
ay
responded
the
deacon
emphatically
with
a
sort
of
drawl
drumming
with
his
fingers
in
his
beard
and
eyeing
Tchertop-hanov
with
his
bright
eager
eyes
'How
's
that
sir
Your
horse
God
help
my
memory
was
stolen
a
fortnight
before
Intercession
last
year
and
now
we
're
near
the
end
of
November
'Well
what
of
that
The
deacon
still
fingered
his
beard
'Why
it
follows
that
more
than
a
year
's
gone
by
since
then
and
your
horse
was
a
dapple
grey
then
just
as
it
is
now
in
fact
it
seems
even
darker
How
's
that
Grey
horses
get
a
great
deal
lighter
in
colour
in
a
year
Tchertop-hanov
started
as
though
someone
had
driven
a
dagger
into
his
heart
It
was
true
the
grey
colour
did
change
How
was
it
such
a
simple
reflection
had
never
occurred
to
him
'You
damned
pigtail
get
out
he
yelled
suddenly
his
eyes
flashing
with
fury
and
instantaneously
he
disappeared
out
of
the
sight
of
the
amazed
deacon
Well
everything
was
over
Now
at
last
everything
was
really
over
everything
was
shattered
the
last
card
trumped
Everything
crumbled
away
at
once
before
that
word
'lighter
Grey
horses
get
lighter
in
colour
'Gallop
gallop
on
accursed
brute
You
can
never
gallop
away
from
that
word
Tchertop-hanov
flew
home
and
again
locked
himself
up
That
this
worthless
jade
was
not
Malek-Adel
that
between
him
and
Malek-Adel
there
was
not
the
smallest
resemblance
that
any
man
of
the
slightest
sense
would
have
seen
this
from
the
first
minute
that
he
Tchertop-hanov
had
been
taken
in
in
the
vulgarest
way
no
that
he
purposely
of
set
intent
tricked
himself
blinded
his
own
eyes
of
all
this
he
had
not
now
the
faintest
doubt
Tchertop-hanov
walked
up
and
down
in
his
room
turning
monotonously
on
his
heels
at
each
wall
like
a
beast
in
a
cage
His
vanity
suffered
intolerably
but
he
was
not
only
tortured
by
the
sting
of
wounded
vanity
he
was
overwhelmed
by
despair
stifled
by
rage
and
burning
with
the
thirst
for
revenge
But
rage
against
whom
On
whom
was
he
to
be
revenged
On
the
Jew
Yaff
Masha
the
deacon
the
Cossack-thief
all
his
neighbours
the
whole
world
himself
His
brain
was
giving
way
The
last
card
was
trumped
That
simile
gratified
him
And
he
was
again
the
most
worthless
the
most
contemptible
of
men
a
common
laughing-stock
a
motley
fool
a
damned
idiot
an
object
for
jibes
to
a
deacon
He
fancied
he
pictured
vividly
how
that
loathsome
pig-tailed
priest
would
tell
the
story
of
the
grey
horse
and
the
foolish
gentleman
O
damn
In
vain
Tchertop-hanov
tried
to
check
his
rising
passion
in
vain
he
tried
to
assure
himself
that
this
horse
though
not
Malek-Adel
was
still
a
good
horse
and
might
be
of
service
to
him
for
many
years
to
come
he
put
this
thought
away
from
him
on
the
spot
with
fury
as
though
there
were
contained
in
it
a
new
insult
to
that
Malek-Adel
whom
he
considered
he
had
wronged
so
already
Yes
indeed
this
jade
this
carrion
he
like
a
blind
idiot
had
put
on
a
level
with
him
Malek-Adel
And
as
to
the
service
the
jade
could
be
to
him
as
though
he
would
ever
deign
to
get
astride
of
him
Never
on
no
consideration
He
would
sell
him
to
a
Tartar
for
dog
's
meat
it
deserved
no
better
end
Yes
that
would
be
best
For
more
than
two
hours
Tchertop-hanov
wandered
up
and
down
his
room
'Perfishka
he
called
peremptorily
all
of
a
sudden
'run
this
minute
to
the
tavern
fetch
a
gallon
of
vodka
Do
you
hear
A
gallon
and
look
sharp
I
want
the
vodka
here
this
very
second
on
the
table
The
vodka
was
not
long
in
making
its
appearance
on
Panteley
Eremyitch's
table
and
he
began
drinking
If
anyone
had
looked
at
Tchertop-hanov
then
if
anyone
could
have
been
a
witness
of
the
sullen
exasperation
with
which
he
drained
glass
after
glass
he
would
inevitably
have
felt
an
involuntary
shudder
of
fear
The
night
came
on
the
tallow
candle
burnt
dimly
on
the
table
Tchertop-hanov
ceased
wandering
from
corner
to
corner
he
sat
all
flushed
with
dull
eyes
which
he
dropped
at
one
time
on
the
floor
at
another
fixed
obstinately
on
the
dark
window
he
got
up
poured
out
some
vodka
drank
it
off
sat
down
again
again
fixed
his
eyes
on
one
point
and
did
not
stir
only
his
breathing
grew
quicker
and
his
face
still
more
flushed
It
seemed
as
though
some
resolution
were
ripening
within
him
which
he
was
himself
ashamed
of
but
which
he
was
gradually
getting
used
to
one
single
thought
kept
obstinately
and
undeviatingly
moving
up
closer
and
closer
one
single
image
stood
out
more
and
more
distinctly
and
under
the
burning
weight
of
heavy
drunkenness
the
angry
irritation
was
replaced
by
a
feeling
of
ferocity
in
his
heart
and
a
vindictive
smile
appeared
on
his
lips
'Yes
the
time
has
come
he
declared
in
a
matter-of-fact
almost
weary
tone
'I
must
get
to
work
He
drank
off
the
last
glass
of
vodka
took
from
over
his
bed
the
pistol
the
very
pistol
from
which
he
had
shot
at
Masha
loaded
it
put
some
cartridges
in
his
pocket
to
be
ready
for
anything
and
went
round
to
the
stables
The
watchman
ran
up
to
him
when
he
began
to
open
the
door
but
he
shouted
to
him
'It
's
I
Are
you
blind
Get
out
The
watchman
moved
a
little
aside
'Get
out
and
go
to
bed
Tchertop-hanov
shouted
at
him
again
'there
's
nothing
for
you
to
guard
here
A
mighty
wonder
a
treasure
indeed
to
watch
over
He
went
into
the
stable
Malek-Adel
the
spurious
Malek-Adel
was
lying
on
his
litter
Tchertop-hanov
gave
him
a
kick
saying
'Get
up
you
brute
Then
he
unhooked
a
halter
from
a
nail
took
off
the
horsecloth
and
flung
it
on
the
ground
and
roughly
turning
the
submissive
horse
round
in
the
box
led
it
out
into
the
courtyard
and
from
the
yard
into
the
open
country
to
the
great
amazement
of
the
watchman
who
could
not
make
out
at
all
where
the
master
was
going
off
to
by
night
leading
an
unharnessed
horse
He
was
of
course
afraid
to
question
him
and
only
followed
him
with
his
eyes
till
he
disappeared
at
the
bend
in
the
road
leading
to
a
neighbouring
wood
Tchertop-hanov
walked
with
long
strides
not
stopping
nor
looking
round
Malek-Adel
we
will
call
him
by
that
name
to
the
end
followed
him
meekly
It
was
a
rather
clear
night
Tchertop-hanov
could
make
out
the
jagged
outline
of
the
forest
which
formed
a
black
mass
in
front
of
him
When
he
got
into
the
chill
night
air
he
would
certainly
have
thrown
off
the
intoxication
of
the
vodka
he
had
drunk
if
it
had
not
been
for
another
stronger
intoxication
which
completely
over-mastered
him
His
head
was
heavy
his
blood
pulsed
in
thuds
in
his
throat
and
ears
but
he
went
on
steadily
and
knew
where
he
was
going
He
had
made
up
his
mind
to
kill
Malek-Adel
he
had
thought
of
nothing
else
the
whole
day
Now
he
had
made
up
his
mind
He
went
out
to
do
this
thing
not
only
calmly
but
confidently
unhesitatingly
as
a
man
going
about
something
from
a
sense
of
duty
This
'job
seemed
a
very
'simple
thing
to
him
in
making
an
end
of
the
impostor
he
was
quits
with
'everyone
at
once
he
punished
himself
for
his
stupidity
and
made
expiation
to
his
real
darling
and
showed
the
whole
world
Tchertop-hanov
worried
himself
a
great
deal
about
the
'whole
world
that
he
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
And
above
all
he
was
making
an
end
of
himself
too
with
the
impostor
for
what
had
he
to
live
for
now
How
all
this
took
shape
in
his
brain
and
why
it
seemed
to
him
so
simple
it
is
not
easy
to
explain
though
not
altogether
impossible
stung
to
the
quick
solitary
without
a
human
soul
near
to
him
without
a
halfpenny
and
with
his
blood
on
fire
with
vodka
he
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
madness
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
even
in
the
absurdest
freaks
of
mad
people
there
is
to
their
eyes
a
sort
of
logic
and
even
justice
Of
his
justice
Tchertop-hanov
was
at
any
rate
fully
persuaded
he
did
not
hesitate
he
made
haste
to
carry
out
sentence
on
the
guilty
without
giving
himself
any
clear
definition
of
whom
he
meant
by
that
term
To
tell
the
truth
he
reflected
very
little
on
what
he
was
about
to
do
'I
must
I
must
make
an
end
was
what
he
kept
stupidly
and
severely
repeating
to
himself
'I
must
make
an
end
And
the
guiltless
guilty
one
followed
in
a
submissive
trot
behind
his
back
But
there
was
no
pity
for
him
in
Tchertop-hanov
's
heart
Not
far
from
the
forest
to
which
he
was
leading
his
horse
there
stretched
a
small
ravine
half
overgrown
with
young
oak
bushes
Tchertop-hanov
went
down
into
it
Malek-Adel
stumbled
and
almost
fell
on
him
'So
you
would
crush
me
would
you
you
damned
brute
shouted
Tchertop-hanov
and
as
though
in
self-defence
he
pulled
the
pistol
out
of
his
pocket
He
no
longer
felt
furious
exasperation
but
that
special
numbness
of
the
senses
which
they
say
comes
over
a
man
before
the
perpetration
of
a
crime
But
his
own
voice
terrified
him
it
sounded
so
wild
and
strange
under
the
cover
of
dark
branches
in
the
close
decaying
dampness
of
the
forest
ravine
Moreover
in
response
to
his
exclamation
some
great
bird
suddenly
fluttered
in
a
tree-top
above
his
head
Tchertop-hanov
shuddered
He
had
as
it
were
roused
a
witness
to
his
act
and
where
In
that
silent
place
where
he
should
not
have
met
a
living
creature
'Away
with
you
devil
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
he
muttered
and
letting
go
Malek-Adel
's
rein
he
gave
him
a
violent
blow
on
the
shoulder
with
the
butt
end
of
the
pistol
Malek-Adel
promptly
turned
back
clambered
out
of
the
ravine
and
ran
away
But
the
thud
of
his
hoofs
was
not
long
audible
The
rising
wind
confused
and
blended
all
sounds
together
Tchertop-hanov
too
slowly
clambered
out
of
the
ravine
reached
the
forest
and
made
his
way
along
the
road
homewards
He
was
ill
at
ease
with
himself
the
weight
he
had
felt
in
his
head
and
his
heart
had
spread
over
all
his
limbs
he
walked
angry
gloomy
dissatisfied
hungry
as
though
some
one
had
insulted
him
snatched
his
prey
his
food
from
him
The
suicide
baffled
in
his
intent
must
know
such
sensations
Suddenly
something
poked
him
behind
between
his
shoulder
blades
He
looked
round
Malek-Adel
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
He
had
walked
after
his
master
he
touched
him
with
his
nose
to
announce
himself
'Ah
shouted
Tchertop-hanov
of
yourself
of
yourself
you
have
come
to
your
death
So
there
In
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
had
snatched
out
his
pistol
drawn
the
trigger
turned
the
muzzle
on
Malek-Adel
's
brow
fired
The
poor
horse
sprung
aside
rose
on
its
haunches
bounded
ten
paces
away
and
suddenly
fell
heavily
and
gasped
as
it
writhed
upon
the
ground
Tchertop-hanov
put
his
two
hands
over
his
ears
and
ran
away
His
knees
were
shaking
under
him
His
drunkenness
and
revenge
and
blind
self-confidence
all
had
flown
at
once
There
was
left
nothing
but
a
sense
of
shame
and
loathing
and
the
consciousness
unmistakeable
that
this
time
he
had
put
an
end
to
himself
too
Six
weeks
later
the
groom
Perfishka
thought
it
his
duty
to
stop
the
commissioner
of
police
as
he
happened
to
be
passing
Bezsonovo
'What
do
you
want
inquired
the
guardian
of
order
'If
you
please
your
excellency
come
into
our
house
answered
the
groom
with
a
low
bow
'Panteley
Eremyitch
I
fancy
is
about
to
die
so
that
I
'm
afraid
of
getting
into
trouble
'What
die
queried
the
commissioner
'Yes
sir
First
his
honour
drank
vodka
every
day
and
now
he
's
taken
to
his
bed
and
got
very
thin
I
fancy
his
honour
does
not
understand
anything
now
He
's
lost
his
tongue
completely
The
commissioner
got
out
of
his
trap
'Have
you
sent
for
the
priest
at
least
Has
your
master
been
confessed
Taken
the
sacrament
'No
sir
The
commissioner
frowned
'How
is
that
my
boy
How
can
that
be
hey
Do
n't
you
know
that
for
that
you
're
liable
to
have
to
answer
heavily
hey
'Indeed
and
I
did
ask
him
the
day
before
yesterday
and
yesterday
again
protested
the
intimidated
groom
Would
n't
you
Panteley
Eremyitch
says
I
let
me
run
for
the
priest
sir
You
hold
your
tongue
idiot
says
he
mind
your
own
business
But
to-day
when
I
began
to
address
him
his
honour
only
looked
at
me
and
twitched
his
moustache
'And
has
he
been
drinking
a
great
deal
of
vodka
inquired
the
commissioner
'Rather
But
if
you
would
be
so
good
your
honour
come
into
his
room
'Well
lead
the
way
grumbled
the
commissioner
and
he
followed
Perfishka
An
astounding
sight
was
in
store
for
him
In
a
damp
dark
back-room
on
a
wretched
bedstead
covered
with
a
horsecloth
with
a
rough
felt
cloak
for
a
pillow
lay
Tchertop-hanov
He
was
not
pale
now
but
yellowish
green
like
a
corpse
with
sunken
eyes
under
leaden
lids
and
a
sharp
pinched
nose
still
reddish
above
his
dishevelled
whiskers
He
lay
dressed
in
his
invariable
Caucasian
coat
with
the
cartridge
pockets
on
the
breast
and
blue
Circassian
trousers
A
Cossack
cap
with
a
crimson
crown
covered
his
forehead
to
his
very
eyebrows
In
one
hand
Tchertop-hanov
held
his
hunting
whip
in
the
other
an
embroidered
tobacco
pouch
Masha
's
last
gift
to
him
On
a
table
near
the
bed
stood
an
empty
spirit
bottle
and
at
the
head
of
the
bed
were
two
water-colour
sketches
pinned
to
the
wall
one
represented
as
far
as
could
be
made
out
a
fat
man
with
a
guitar
in
his
hand
probably
Nedopyuskin
the
other
portrayed
a
horseman
galloping
at
full
speed
The
horse
was
like
those
fabulous
animals
which
are
sketched
by
children
on
walls
and
fences
but
the
carefully
washed-in
dappling
of
the
horse
's
grey
coat
and
the
cartridge
pocket
on
the
rider
's
breast
the
pointed
toes
of
his
boots
and
the
immense
moustaches
left
no
room
for
doubt
this
sketch
was
meant
to
represent
Panteley
Eremyitch
riding
on
Malek-Adel
The
astonished
commissioner
of
police
did
not
know
how
to
proceed
The
silence
of
death
reigned
in
the
room
'Why
he
's
dead
already
he
thought
and
raising
his
voice
he
said
'Panteley
Eremyitch
Eh
Panteley
Eremyitch
Then
something
extraordinary
occurred
Tchertop-hanov
's
eyelids
slowly
opened
the
eyes
fast
growing
dim
moved
first
from
right
to
left
then
from
left
to
right
rested
on
the
commissioner
saw
him
Something
gleamed
in
their
dull
whites
the
semblance
of
a
flash
came
back
to
them
the
blue
lips
were
gradually
unglued
and
a
hoarse
almost
sepulchral
voice
was
heard
'Panteley
Eremyitch
of
the
ancient
hereditary
nobility
is
dying
who
can
hinder
him
He
owes
no
man
anything
asks
nothing
from
any
one
Leave
him
people
Go
The
hand
holding
the
whip
tried
to
lift
it
In
vain
The
lips
cleaved
together
again
the
eyes
closed
and
as
before
Tchertop-hanov
lay
on
his
comfortless
bed
flat
as
an
empty
sack
and
his
feet
close
together
'Let
me
know
when
he
dies
the
commissioner
whispered
to
Perfishka
as
he
went
out
of
the
room
'and
I
suppose
you
can
send
for
the
priest
now
You
must
observe
due
order
give
him
extreme
unction
Perfishka
went
that
same
day
for
the
priest
and
the
following
morning
he
had
to
let
the
commissioner
know
Panteley
Eremyitch
had
died
in
the
night
When
they
buried
him
two
men
followed
his
coffin
the
groom
Perfishka
and
Moshel
Leyba
The
news
of
Tchertop-hanov
's
death
had
somehow
reached
the
Jew
and
he
did
not
fail
to
pay
this
last
act
of
respect
to
his
benefactor
A
LIVING
RELIC
'O
native
land
of
long
suffering
Land
of
the
Russian
people
F
TYUTCHEV
A
French
proverb
says
that
'a
dry
fisherman
and
a
wet
hunter
are
a
sorry
sight
Never
having
had
any
taste
for
fishing
I
can
not
decide
what
are
the
fisherman
's
feelings
in
fine
bright
weather
and
how
far
in
bad
weather
the
pleasure
derived
from
the
abundance
of
fish
compensates
for
the
unpleasantness
of
being
wet
But
for
the
sportsman
rain
is
a
real
calamity
It
was
to
just
this
calamity
that
Yermola
and
I
were
exposed
on
one
of
our
expeditions
after
grouse
in
the
Byelevsky
district
The
rain
never
ceased
from
early
morning
What
did
n't
we
do
to
escape
it
We
put
macintosh
capes
almost
right
over
our
heads
and
stood
under
the
trees
to
avoid
the
raindrops
The
waterproof
capes
to
say
nothing
of
their
hindering
our
shooting
let
the
water
through
in
the
most
shameless
fashion
and
under
the
trees
though
at
first
certainly
the
rain
did
not
reach
us
afterwards
the
water
collected
on
the
leaves
suddenly
rushed
through
every
branch
dripped
on
us
like
a
waterspout
a
chill
stream
made
its
way
under
our
neck-ties
and
trickled
down
our
spines
This
was
'quite
unpleasant
as
Yermola
expressed
it
'No
Piotr
Petrovitch
he
cried
at
last
'we
ca
n't
go
on
like
this
There
's
no
shooting
to-day
The
dogs
scent
is
drowned
The
guns
miss
fire
Pugh
What
a
mess
'What
's
to
be
done
I
queried
'Well
let
's
go
to
Aleksyevka
You
do
n't
know
it
perhaps
there
's
a
settlement
of
that
name
belonging
to
your
mother
it
's
seven
miles
from
here
We
'll
stay
the
night
there
and
to-morrow
'Come
back
here
'No
not
here
I
know
of
some
places
beyond
Aleksyevka
ever
