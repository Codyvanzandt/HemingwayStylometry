and
see
far
ahead
of
them
the
two
figures
in
the
moonlight
The
two
Indians
straighten
up
They
examine
the
garments
White
chief
snappy
dresser
the
tall
Indian
remarks
holding
up
an
initialled
shirt
White
chief
going
get
pretty
cold
the
small
Indian
remarks
He
hands
a
vest
to
the
tall
Indian
The
tall
Indian
rolls
all
the
clothing
all
the
cast-off
garments
into
a
bundle
and
they
start
back
along
the
tracks
to
the
town
Better
keep
clothes
for
white
chief
or
sellem
Salvation
Army
asks
the
short
Indian
Better
sellem
Salvation
Army
the
tall
Indian
grunts
White
chief
maybe
never
come
back
White
chief
come
back
all
right
grunted
the
little
Indian
Better
sellem
Salvation
Army
anyway
grunts
the
tall
Indian
White
chief
need
new
clothes
anyhow
when
spring
comes
As
they
walked
down
the
tracks
toward
town
the
air
seemed
to
soften
The
Indians
walk
uneasily
now
Through
the
tamaracks
and
cedars
beside
the
railway
tracks
a
warm
wind
is
blowing
The
snow-drifts
are
melting
now
beside
the
tracks
Something
stirs
inside
the
two
Indians
Some
urge
Some
strange
pagan
disturbance
The
warm
wind
is
blowing
The
tall
Indian
stops
moistens
his
finger
and
holds
it
up
in
the
air
The
little
Indian
watches
Chinook
he
asks
Heap
chinook
the
tall
Indian
says
They
hurry
on
toward
town
The
moon
is
blurred
now
by
clouds
carried
by
the
warm
chinook
wind
that
is
blowing
Want
to
get
in
town
before
rush
the
tall
Indian
grunts
Red
brothers
want
be
well
up
in
line
the
little
Indian
grunts
anxiously
Nobody
work
in
factory
now
the
tall
Indian
grunted
Better
hurry
The
warm
wind
blows
Inside
the
Indians
strange
longings
were
stirring
They
knew
what
they
wanted
Spring
at
last
wascoming
to
the
frozen
little
Northern
town
The
two
Indians
hurried
along
the
track
