pumps
They
will
be
in
time
the
workman
said
Scripps
knew
it
was
the
factory
They
weren
t
going
to
fool
him
on
that
He
walked
up
to
the
door
There
was
a
sign
on
it
KEEP
OUT
THIS
MEANS
YOU
Can
that
mean
me
Scripps
wondered
He
knocked
on
the
door
and
went
in
I
d
like
to
speak
to
the
manager
he
said
standing
quietly
in
the
half-light
Workmen
were
passing
him
carrying
the
new
raw
pumps
on
their
shoulders
They
hummed
snatches
of
songs
as
they
passed
The
handles
of
the
pumps
flopped
stiffly
in
dumb
protest
Some
pumps
had
no
handles
They
perhaps
after
all
are
the
lucky
ones
Scripps
thought
A
little
man
came
up
to
him
He
was
well-built
short
with
wide
shoulders
and
a
grim
face
You
were
asking
for
the
manager
Yes
sir
I
m
the
foreman
here
What
I
say
goes
Can
you
hire
and
fire
Scripps
asked
I
can
do
one
as
easily
as
the
other
the
foreman
said
I
want
a
job
Any
experience
Not
in
pumps
All
right
the
foreman
said
We
ll
put
you
on
piece-work
Here
Yogi
he
called
to
one
of
the
men
who
was
standing
looking
out
of
the
window
of
the
factory
show
this
new
chum
where
to
stow
his
swag
and
how
to
find
his
way
around
these
diggings
The
foreman
looked
Scripps
up
and
down
I
m
an
Australian
he
said
Hope
you
ll
like
the
lay
here
He
walked
off
The
man
called
Yogi
Johnson
came
over
from
the
window
Glad
to
meet
you
he
said
He
was
a
chunky
well-built
fellow
One
of
the
sort
you
see
around
almost
anywhere
He
looked
as
though
he
had
been
through
things
Your
foreman
s
the
first
Australian
I
ve
ever
met
Scripps
said
Oh
he
s
not
an
Australian
Yogi
said
He
was
just
with
the
Australians
once
during
the
war
and
it
made
a
big
impression
on
him
Were
you
in
the
war
Scripps
asked
Yes
Yogi
Johnson
said
I
was
the
first
man
to
go
from
Cadillac
It
must
have
been
quite
an
experience
It
s
meant
a
lot
to
me
Yogi
answered
Come
on
and
I
ll
show
you
around
the
works
Scripps
followed
this
man
who
showed
him
through
the
pump-factory
It
was
dark
but
warm
inside
the
pump-factory
Men
naked
to
the
waist
took
the
pumps
in
huge
tongs
as
they
came
trundling
by
on
an
endless
chain
culling
out
the
misfits
and
placing
the
perfect
pumps
on
another
endless
chain
that
carried
them
up
into
the
cooling
room
Other
men
Indians
for
the
most
part
wearing
only
breech-clouts
broke
up
the
misfit
pumps
with
huge
hammers
and
adzes
and
rapidly
recast
them
into
axe
heads
wagon
springs
trombone
slides
bullet
moulds
all
the
by-products
of
a
big
pump-factory
There
was
nothing
wasted
Yogi
pointed
out
A
group
of
Indian
boys
humming
to
themselves
one
of
the
old
tribal
chantries
squatted
in
a
corner
of
the
big
forging
room
shaping
the
little
fragments
that
were
chipped
from
the
pumps
in
casting
into
safety
razor
blades
They
work
naked
Yogi
said
They
re
searched
as
they
go
out
Sometimes
they
try
and
conceal
the
razor
blades
and
take
them
out
with
them
to
bootleg
There
must
be
quite
a
loss
that
way
Scripps
said
Oh
no
Yogi
answered
The
inspectors
get
most
of
them
Upstairs
apart
in
a
separate
room
two
old
men
were
working
Yogi
opened
the
door
One
of
the
old
men
looked
over
his
steel
spectacles
and
frowned
You
make
a
draft
he
said
Shut
the
door
the
other
old
man
said
in
the
high
complaining
voice
of
the
very
old
They
re
our
two
hand-workers
Yogi
said
They
make
all
the
pumps
the
manufactory
sends
out
to
the
big
international
pump
races
You
remember
our
Peerless
Pounder
that
won
the
pump
race
in
Italy
where
Franky
Dawson
was
killed
I
read
about
it
in
the
paper
Scripps
answered
Mr
Borrow
over
there
in
the
corner
made
the
Peerless
Pounder
all
himself
by
hand
Yogi
said
I
carved
it
direct
from
the
steel
with
this
knife
Mr
Borrow
held
up
a
short-bladed
razorlike-looking
knife
Took
me
eighteen
months
to
get
it
right
The
Peerless
Pounder
was
quite
a
pump
all
right
the
high-voiced
little
old
man
said
But
we
re
working
on
one
now
that
will
show
its
heels
to
any
of
them
foreign
pumps
aren
t
we
Henry
That
s
Mr
Shaw
Yogi
said
in
an
undertone
He
s
probably
the
greatest
living
pump-maker
You
boys
get
along
and
leave
us
alone
Mr
Borrow
said
He
was
carving
away
steadily
his
infirm
old
hands
shaking
a
little
between
strokes
Let
the
boys
watch
Mr
Shaw
said
Where
you
from
young
feller
I
ve
just
come
from
Mancelona
Scripps
answered
My
wife
left
me
Well
you
won
t
have
no
difficulty
finding
another
one
Mr
Shaw
said
You
re
a
likely-looking
young
feller
But
take
my
advice
and
take
your
time
A
poor
wife
ain
t
much
better
than
no
wife
at
all
I
wouldn
t
say
that
Henry
Mr
Borrow
remarked
in
his
high
voice
Any
wife
at
all
s
a
pretty
good
wife
the
way
things
are
going
now
You
take
my
advice
young
feller
and
go
slow
Get
yourself
a
good
one
this
time
Henry
knows
a
thing
or
two
Mr
Borrow
said
He
knows
what
he
s
talking
about
there
He
laughed
a
high
cackling
laugh
Mr
Shaw
the
old
pump-maker
blushed
You
boys
get
along
and
leave
us
get
on
with
our
pump-making
he
said
Henry
and
me
here
we
got
a
sight
of
work
to
do
I
m
very
glad
to
have
met
you
Scripps
said
Come
on
Yogi
said
I
better
get
you
started
or
the
foreman
will
be
on
my
tail
He
put
Scripps
to
work
collaring
pistons
in
the
piston-collaring
room
There
Scripps
worked
for
almost
a
year
In
some
ways
it
was
the
happiest
year
of
his
life
In
other
ways
it
was
a
nightmare
A
hideous
nightmare
In
the
end
he
grew
to
like
it
In
other
ways
he
hated
it
Before
he
knew
it
a
year
had
passed
He
was
still
collaring
pistons
But
what
strange
things
had
happened
in
that
year
Often
he
wondered
about
them
As
he
wondered
collaring
a
piston
now
almost
automatically
he
listened
to
the
laughter
that
came
up
from
below
where
the
little
Indian
lads
were
shaping
what
were
to
be
razor
blades
As
he
listened
something
rose
in
his
throat
and
almost
choked
him
That
night
after
his
first
day
in
the
pump-factory
the
first
day
in
what
was
or
were
to
become
an
endless
succession
of
days
of
dull
piston-collaring
Scripps
went
again
to
the
beanery
to
eat
All
day
he
had
kept
his
bird
concealed
Something
told
him
that
the
pump-factory
was
not
the
place
to
bring
his
bird
out
in
During
the
day
the
bird
had
several
times
made
him
uncomfortable
but
he
had
adjusted
his
clothes
to
it
and
even
cut
a
little
slit
the
bird
could
poke
his
beak
out
through
in
search
of
fresh
air
Now
the
day
s
work
was
over
It
was
finished
Scripps
on
his
way
to
the
beanery
Scripps
happy
that
he
was
working
with
his
hands
Scripps
thinking
of
the
old
pump-makers
Scripps
going
to
the
society
of
the
friendly
waitress
Who
was
that
waitress
anyway
What
was
it
had
happened
to
her
in
Paris
He
must
find
out
more
about
this
Paris
Yogi
Johnson
had
been
there
He
would
quiz
Yogi
Get
him
to
talk
Draw
him
out
Make
him
tell
what
he
knew
He
knew
a
trick
or
two
about
that
Watching
the
sunset
out
over
the
Petoskey
Harbor
the
lake
now
frozen
and
great
blocks
of
ice
jutting
up
over
the
breakwater
Scripps
strode
down
the
streets
of
Petoskey
to
the
beanery
He
would
have
liked
to
ask
Yogi
Johnson
to
eat
with
him
but
he
didn
t
dare
Not
yet
That
would
come
later
All
in
good
time
No
need
to
rush
matters
with
a
man
like
Yogi
Who
was
Yogi
anyway
Had
he
really
been
in
the
war
What
had
the
war
meant
to
him
Was
he
really
the
first
man
to
enlist
from
Cadillac
Where
was
Cadillac
anyway
Time
would
tell
Scripps
O
Neil
opened
the
door
and
went
into
the
beanery
The
elderly
waitress
got
up
from
the
chair
where
she
had
been
reading
the
overseas
edition
of
The
Manchester
Guardian
and
put
the
paper
and
her
steel-rimmed
spectacles
on
top
of
the
cash
register
Good
evening
she
said
simply
It
s
good
to
have
you
back
Something
stirred
inside
Scripps
O
Neil
A
feeling
that
he
could
not
define
came
within
him
I
ve
been
working
all
day
long
he
looked
at
the
elderly
waitress
for
you
he
added
How
lovely
she
said
And
then
smiled
shyly
And
I
have
been
working
all
day
long
for
you
Tears
came
into
Scripps
s
eyes
Something
stirred
inside
him
again
He
reached
forward
to
take
the
elderly
waitress
s
hand
and
with
quiet
dignity
she
laid
it
within
his
own
You
are
my
woman
he
said
Tears
came
into
her
eyes
too
You
are
my
man
she
said
Once
again
I
say
you
are
my
woman
Scripps
pronounced
the
words
solemnly
Something
had
broken
inside
him
again
He
felt
he
could
not
keep
from
crying
Let
this
be
our
wedding
ceremony
the
elderly
waitress
said
Scripps
pressed
her
hand
You
are
my
woman
he
said
simply
You
are
my
man
and
more
than
my
man
She
looked
into
his
eyes
You
are
all
of
America
to
me
Let
us
go
Scripps
said
Have
you
your
bird
asked
the
waitress
laying
aside
her
apron
and
folding
the
copy
of
The
Manchester
Guardian
Weekly
I
ll
bring
The
Guardian
if
you
don
t
mind
she
said
wrapping
the
paper
in
her
apron
It
s
a
new
paper
and
I
ve
not
read
it
yet
I
m
very
fond
of
The
Guardian
Scripps
said
My
family
have
taken
it
ever
since
I
can
remember
My
father
was
a
great
admirer
of
Gladstone
My
father
went
to
Eton
with
Gladstone
the
elderly
waitress
said
And
now
I
am
ready
She
had
donned
a
coat
and
stood
ready
her
apron
her
steel-rimmed
spectacles
in
their
worn
black
morocco
case
her
copy
of
The
Manchester
Guardian
held
in
her
hand
Have
you
no
hat
asked
Scripps
No
Then
I
will
buy
you
one
Scripps
said
tenderly
It
will
be
your
wedding
gift
the
elderly
waitress
said
Again
there
were
tears
shone
in
her
eyes
And
now
let
us
go
Scripps
said
The
elderly
waitress
came
out
from
behind
the
counter
and
together
hand
in
hand
they
strode
out
into
the
night
Inside
the
beanery
the
black
cook
pushed
up
the
wicket
and
looked
through
from
the
kitchen
Dey
ve
gone
off
he
chuckled
Gone
off
into
de
night
Well
well
well
He
closed
the
wicket
softly
Even
he
was
a
little
impressed
Half
an
hour
later
Scripps
O
Neil
and
the
elderly
waitress
returned
to
the
beanery
as
man
and
wife
The
beanery
looked
much
the
same
There
was
the
long
counter
the
salt
cellars
the
sugar
containers
the
catsup
bottle
the
Worcestershire
Sauce
bottle
There
was
the
wicket
that
led
into
the
kitchen
Behind
the
counter
was
the
relief
waitress
She
was
a
buxom
jolly-looking
girl
and
she
wore
a
white
apron
At
the
counter
reading
a
Detroit
paper
sat
a
drummer
The
drummer
was
eating
a
T-bone
steak
and
hashed-brown
potatoes
Something
very
beautiful
had
happened
to
Scripps
and
the
elderly
waitress
Now
they
were
hungry
They
wished
to
eat
The
elderly
waitress
looking
at
Scripps
Scripps
looking
at
the
elderly
waitress
The
drummer
reading
his
paper
and
occasionally
putting
a
little
catsup
on
his
hashed-brown
potatoes
The
other
waitress
Mandy
back
of
the
counter
in
her
freshly
starched
white
apron
The
frost
on
the
windows
The
warmth
inside
The
cold
outside
Scripps
s
bird
rather
rumpled
now
sitting
on
the
counter
and
preening
his
feathers
So
you
ve
come
back
Mandy
the
waitress
said
The
cook
said
you
had
gone
out
into
the
night
The
elderly
waitress
looked
at
Mandy
her
eyes
brightened
her
voice
calm
and
now
of
a
deeper
richer
timbre
We
are
man
and
wife
now
she
said
kindly
We
have
just
been
married
What
would
you
like
to
eat
for
supper
Scripps
dear
I
don
t
know
Scripps
said
He
felt
vaguely
uneasy
Something
was
stirring
within
him
Perhaps
you
have
eaten
enough
of
the
beans
dear
Scripps
the
elderly
waitress
now
his
wife
said
The
drummer
looked
up
from
his
paper
Scripps
noticed
that
it
was
the
Detroit
News
There
was
a
fine
paper
That
s
a
fine
paper
you
re
reading
Scripps
said
to
the
drummer
It
s
a
good
paper
the
News
the
drummer
said
You
two
on
your
honeymoon
Yes
Mrs
Scripps
said
we
are
man
and
wife
now
Well
said
the
drummer
that
s
a
mighty
fine
thing
to
be
I
m
a
married
man
myself
Are
you
said
Scripps
My
wife
left
me
It
was
in
Mancelona
Don
t
let
s
talk
of
that
any
more
Scripps
dear
Mrs
Scripps
said
You
ve
told
that
story
so
many
times
Yes
dear
Scripps
agreed
He
felt
vaguely
mistrustful
of
himself
Something
somewhere
was
stirring
inside
of
him
He
looked
at
the
waitress
called
Mandy
standing
robust
and
vigorously
lovely
in
her
newly
starched
white
apron
He
watched
her
hands
healthy
calm
capable
hands
doing
the
duties
of
her
waitress-hood
Try
one
of
these
T-bones
with
hashed-brown
potatoes
the
drummer
suggested
They
got
a
nice
T-bone
here
Would
you
like
one
dear
Scripps
asked
his
wife
I
ll
just
take
a
bowl
of
milk
and
crackers
the
elderly
Mrs
Scripps
said
You
have
whatever
you
want
dear
Here
s
your
crackers
and
milk
Diana
Mandy
said
placing
them
on
the
counter
Do
you
want
a
T-bone
sir
Yes
Scripps
said
Something
stirred
again
within
him
Well
done
or
rare
Rare
please
The
waitress
turned
and
called
into
the
wicket
Tea
for
one
Let
it
go
raw
Thank
you
Scripps
said
He
eyed
the
waitress
Mandy
She
had
a
gift
for
the
picturesque
in
speech
that
girl
It
had
been
that
very
picturesque
quality
in
her
speech
that
had
first
drawn
him
to
his
present
wife
That
and
her
strange
background
England
the
Lake
Country
Scripps
striding
through
the
Lake
Country
with
Wordsworth
A
field
of
golden
daffodils
The
wind
blowing
at
Windermere
Far
off
perhaps
a
stag
at
bay
Ah
that
was
farther
north
in
Scotland
They
were
a
hardy
race
those
Scots
deep
in
their
mountain
fastnesses
Harry
Lauder
and
his
pipe
The
Highlanders
in
the
Great
War
Why
had
not
he
Scripps
been
in
the
war
That
was
where
that
chap
Yogi
Johnson
had
it
on
him
The
war
would
have
meant
much
to
him
Scripps
Why
hadn
t
he
been
in
it
Why
hadn
t
he
heard
of
it
in
time
Perhaps
he
was
too
old
Look
at
that
old
French
General
Joffre
though
Surely
he
was
a
younger
man
than
that
old
general
General
Foch
praying
for
victory
The
French
troops
kneeling
along
the
Chemin
des
Dames
praying
for
victory
The
Germans
with
their
Gott
mit
uns
What
a
mockery
Surely
he
was
no
older
than
that
French
General
Foch
He
wondered
Mandy
the
waitress
placed
his
T-bone
steak
and
hashed-brown
potatoes
on
the
counter
before
him
As
she
laid
the
plate
down
just
for
an
instant
her
hand
touched
his
Scripps
felt
a
strange
thrill
go
through
him
Life
was
before
him
He
was
not
an
old
man
Why
were
there
no
wars
now
Perhaps
there
were
Men
were
fighting
in
China
Chinamen
Chinamen
killing
one
another
What
for
Scripps
wondered
What
was
it
all
about
anyway
Mandy
the
buxom
waitress
leaned
forward
Say
she
said
did
I
ever
tell
you
about
the
last
words
of
Henry
James
Really
dear
Mandy
Mrs
Scripps
said
you
ve
told
that
story
rather
often
Let
s
hear
it
Scripps
said
I
m
very
interested
in
Henry
James
Henry
James
Henry
James
That
chap
who
had
gone
away
from
his
own
land
to
live
in
England
among
Englishmen
Why
had
he
done
it
For
what
had
he
left
America
Weren
t
his
roots
here
His
brother
William
Boston
Pragmatism
Harvard
University
Old
John
Harvard
with
silver
buckles
on
his
shoes
Charley
Brickley
Eddie
Mahan
Where
were
they
now
Well
Mandy
began
Henry
James
became
a
British
subject
on
his
death-bed
At
once
as
soon
as
the
king
heard
Henry
James
had
become
a
British
subject
he
sent
around
the
highest
decoration
in
his
power
to
bestow
the
Order
of
Merit
The
O
M
the
elderly
Mrs
Scripps
explained
That
was
it
the
waitress
said
Professors
Gosse
and
Saintsbury
came
with
the
man
who
brought
the
decoration
Henry
James
was
lying
on
his
death-bed
and
his
eyes
were
shut
There
was
a
single
candle
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
The
nurse
allowed
them
to
come
near
the
bed
and
they
put
the
ribbon
of
the
decoration
around
James
s
neck
and
the
decoration
lay
on
the
sheet
over
Henry
James
s
chest
Professors
Gosse
and
Saintsbury
leaned
forward
and
smoothed
the
ribbon
of
the
decoration
Henry
James
never
opened
his
eyes
The
nurse
told
them
they
all
must
go
out
of
the
room
and
they
all
went
out
of
the
room
When
they
were
all
gone
Henry
James
spoke
to
the
nurse
He
never
opened
his
eyes
Nurse
Henry
James
said
put
out
the
candle
nurse
and
spare
my
blushes
Those
were
the
last
words
he
ever
spoke
James
was
quite
a
writer
Scripps
O
Neil
said
He
was
strangely
moved
by
the
story
You
don
t
always
tell
it
the
same
way
dear
Mrs
Scripps
remarked
to
Mandy
There
were
tears
in
Mandy
s
eyes
I
feel
very
strongly
about
Henry
James
she
said
What
was
the
matter
with
James
asked
the
drummer
Wasn
t
America
good
enough
for
him
Scripps
O
Neil
was
thinking
about
Mandy
the
waitress
What
a
background
she
must
have
that
girl
What
a
fund
of
anecdotes
A
chap
could
go
far
with
a
woman
like
that
to
help
him
He
stroked
the
little
bird
that
sat
on
the
lunch-counter
before
him
The
bird
pecked
at
his
finger
Was
the
little
bird
a
hawk
A
falcon
perhaps
from
one
of
the
big
Michigan
falconries
Was
it
perhaps
a
robin
Pulling
and
tugging
at
the
early
worm
on
some
green
lawn
somewhere
He
wondered
What
do
you
call
your
bird
the
drummer
asked
I
haven
t
named
him
yet
What
would
you
call
him
Why
not
call
him
Ariel
Mandy
asked
Or
Puck
Mrs
Scripps
put
in
What
s
it
mean
asked
the
drummer
It
s
a
character
out
of
Shakespeare
Mandy
explained
Oh
give
the
bird
a
chance
What
would
you
call
him
Scripps
turned
to
the
drummer
He
ain
t
a
parrot
is
he
asked
the
drummer
If
he
was
a
parrot
you
could
call
him
Polly
There
s
a
character
in
The
Beggar
s
Opera
called
Polly
Mandy
explained
Scripps
wondered
Perhaps
the
bird
was
a
parrot
A
parrot
strayed
from
some
comfortable
home
with
some
old
maid
The
untilled
soil
of
some
New
England
spinster
Better
wait
till
you
see
how
he
turns
out
the
drummer
advised
You
got
plenty
of
time
to
name
him
This
drummer
had
sound
ideas
He
Scripps
did
not
even
know
what
sex
the
bird
was
Whether
he
was
a
boy
bird
or
a
girl
bird
Wait
till
you
see
if
he
lays
eggs
the
drummer
suggested
Scripps
looked
into
the
drummer
s
eyes
The
fellow
had
voiced
his
own
unspoken
thought
You
know
a
thing
or
two
drummer
he
said
Well
the
drummer
admitted
modestly
I
ain
t
drummed
all
these
years
for
nothing
You
re
right
there
pal
Scripps
said
That
s
a
nice
bird
you
got
there
brother
the
drummer
said
You
want
to
hang
onto
that
bird
Scripps
knew
it
Ah
these
drummers
know
a
thing
or
two
Going
up
and
down
over
the
face
of
this
great
America
of
ours
These
drummers
kept
their
eyes
open
They
were
no
fools
Listen
the
drummer
said
He
pushed
his
derby
hat
off
his
brow
and
leaning
forward
spat
into
the
tall
brass
cuspidor
that
stood
beside
his
stool
I
want
to
tell
you
about
a
pretty
beautiful
thing
that
happened
to
me
once
in
Bay
City
Mandy
the
waitress
leaned
forward
Mrs
Scripps
leaned
toward
the
drummer
to
hear
better
The
drummer
looked
apologetically
at
Scripps
and
stroked
the
bird
with
his
forefinger
Tell
you
about
it
some
other
time
brother
he
said
Scripps
understood
From
out
of
the
kitchen
through
the
wicket
in
the
hall
came
a
high-pitched
haunting
laugh
Scripps
listened
Could
that
be
the
laughter
of
the
Negro
He
wondered
Scripps
going
slowly
to
work
in
the
pump-factory
in
the
mornings
Mrs
Scripps
looking
out
of
the
window
and
watching
him
go
up
the
street
Not

A

of

For

Could
she
keep

Could

for

She
wondered

Diana
Scripps

was
her
own
name
It
had
been
her
mother
s
too
Diana
Scripps
looking
into
the
mirror
and
wondering
could
she
hold
him
It
was
getting
to
be
a
question
Why
had
he
ever
met
Mandy
Would
she
have
the
courage
to
break
off
going
to
the
restaurant
with
Scripps
to
eat
She
couldn
t
do
that
He
would
go
alone
She
knew
that
It
was
no
use
trying
to
pull
wool
over
her
own
eyes
He
would
go
alone
and
he
would
talk
with
Mandy
Diana
looked
into
the
mirror
Could
she
hold
him
Could
she
hold
him
That
thought
never
left
her
now
Every
night
at
the
restaurant
she
couldn
t
call
it
a
beanery
now
that
made
a
lump
come
in
her
throat
and
made
her
throat
feel
hard
and
choky
Every
night
at
the
restaurant
now
Scripps
and
Mandy
talked
together
The
girl
was
trying
to
take
him
away
Him
her
Scripps
Trying
to
take
him
away
Take
him
away
Could
she
Diana
hold
him
She
was
no
better
than
a
slut
that
Mandy
Was
that
the
way
to
do
Was
that
the
thing
to
do
Go
after
another
woman
s
man
Come
between
man
and
wife
Break
up
a
home
And
all
with
these
interminable
literary
reminiscences
These
endless
anecdotes
Scripps
was
fascinated
by
Mandy
Diana
admitted
that
to
herself
But
she
might
hold
him
That
was
all
that
mattered
now
To
hold
him
To
hold
him
Not
to
let
him
go
Make
him
stay

Scripps
brightened
A
little
of
the
old
light
shining
in
Scripps
s
eyes
now
Then
it
died
Some
little
mistake
in
the
wording
some
slip
in
her
understanding
of
a
phrase
some
divergence
in
her
attitude
made
it
all
ring
false
She
would
go
on
She
was
not

was

and

him
She
looked
away
from

and
slit
open

lay
on

It
was

Author
s
Note
This
is
the
same
day
on
which
the
story
starts
back
on
page
three
A
chinook
wind
was
blowing
Workmen
were
coming
home
from
the
factory
Scripps
s
bird
singing
in
its
cage
Diana
looking
out
of
the
open
window
Diana
watching
for
her
Scripps
to
come
up
the
street
Could
she
hold
him
Could
she
hold
him
If
she
couldn
t
hold
him
would
he
leave
her
his
bird
She
had
felt
lately
that
she
couldn
t
hold
him
In
the
nights
now
when
she
touched
Scripps
he
rolled
away
not
toward
her
It
was
a
little
sign
but
life
was
made
up
of
little
signs
She
felt
she
couldn
t
hold
him
As
she
looked
out
of
the
window
a
copy
of
The
Century
Magazine
dropped
from
her
nerveless
hand
The
Century
had
a
new
editor
There
were
more
woodcuts
Glenn
Frank
had
gone
to
head
some
great
university
somewhere
There
were
more
Van
Dorens
on
the
magazine
Diana
felt
that
might
turn
the
trick
Happily
she
had
opened
The
Century
and
read
all
morning
Then
the
wind
the
warm
chinook
wind
had
started
to
blow
and
she
knew
Scripps
would
soon
be
home
Men
were
coming
down
the
street
in
increasing
numbers
Was
Scripps
among
them
She
did
not
like
to
put
on
her
spectacles
to
look
She
wanted
Scripps
s
first
glimpse
of
her
to
be
of
her
at
her
best
As
she
felt
him
drawing
nearer
the
confidence
she
had
had
in
The
Century
grew
fainter
She
had
so
hoped
that
would
give
her
the
something
which
would
hold
him
She
wasn
t
sure
now
Scripps
coming
down
the
street
with
a
crowd
of
excited
workmen
Men
stirred
by
the
spring
Scripps
swinging
his
lunch-bucket
Scripps
waving
good-by
to
the
workmen
who
trooped
one
by
one
into
what
had
formerly
been
a
saloon
Scripps
not
looking
up
at
the
window
Scripps
coming
up
the
stairs
Scripps
coming
nearer
Scripps
coming
nearer
Scripps
here
Good
afternoon
dear
Scripps
she
said
I
ve
been
reading
a
story
by
Ruth
Suckow
Hello
Diana
Scripps
answered
He
set
down
his
lunch-pail
She
looked
worn
and
old
He
could
afford
to
be
polite
What
was
the
story
about
Diana
he
asked
It
was
about
a
little
girl
in
Iowa
Diana
said
She
moved
toward
him
It
was
about
people
on
the
land
It
reminded
me
a
little
of
my
own
Lake
Country
That
so
asked
Scripps
In
some
ways
the
pump-factory
had
hardened
him
His
speech
had
become
more
clipped
More
like
these
hardy
Northern
workers
But
his
mind
was
the
same
Would
you
like
me
to
read
a
little
of
it
out
loud
Diana
asked
They
re
some
lovely
woodcuts
How
about
going
down
to
the
beanery
Scripps
said
As
you
wish
dear
Diana
said
Then
her
voice
broke
I
wish
oh
I
wish
you
d
never
seen
that
place
She
wiped
away
her
tears
Scripps
had
not
even
seen
them
I
ll
bring
the
bird
dear
Diana
said
He
hasn
t
been
out
all
day
Together
they
went
down
the
street
to
the
beanery
They
did
not
walk
hand
in
hand
now
They
walked
like
what
are
called
old
married
people
Mrs
Scripps
carried
the
bird-cage
The
bird
was
happy
in
the
warm
wind
Men
lurching
along
drunk
with
the
spring
passed
them
Many
spoke
to
Scripps
He
was
well
known
and
well
liked
in
the
town
now
Some
as
they
lurched
by
raised
their
hats
to
Mrs
Scripps
She
responded
vaguely
If
I
can
only
hold
him
she
was
thinking
If
I
can
only
hold
him
As
they
walked
along
the
slushy
snow
of
the
narrow
sidewalk
of
the
Northern
town
something
began
to
beat
in
her
head
Perhaps
it
was
the
rhythm
of
their
walking
together
I
can
t
hold
him
I
can
t
hold
him
I
can
t
hold
him
Scripps
took
her
arm
as
they
crossed
the
street
When
his
hand
touched
her
arm
Diana
knew
it
was
true
She
would
never
hold
him
A
group
of
Indians
passed
them
on
the
street
Were
they
laughing
at
her
or
was
it
some
tribal
jest
Diana
didn
t
know
All
she
knew
was
that
rhythm
that
beat
into
her
brain
I
can
t
hold
him
I
can
t
hold
him
