EVERYBODY
was
drunk
The
whole
battery
was
drunk
going
along
the
road
in
the
dark
We
were
going
to
the
Champagne
The
lieutenant
kept
riding
his
horse
out
into
the
fields
and
saying
to
him
“
I
’
m
drunk
I
tell
you
mon
vieux
Oh
I
am
so
soused
”
We
went
along
the
road
all
night
in
the
dark
and
the
adjutant
kept
riding
up
alongside
my
kitchen
and
saying
“
You
must
put
it
out
It
is
dangerous
It
will
be
observed
”
We
were
fifty
kilometers
from
the
front
but
the
adjutant
worried
about
the
fire
in
my
kitchen
It
was
funny
going
along
that
road
That
was
when
I
was
a
kitchen
corporal
THE
first
matador
got
the
horn
through
his
sword
hand
and
the
crowd
hooted
him
out
The
second
matador
slipped
and
the
bull
caught
him
through
the
belly
and
he
hung
on
to
the
horn
with
one
hand
and
held
the
other
tight
against
the
place
and
the
bull
rammed
him
wham
against
the
wall
and
the
horn
came
out
and
he
lay
in
the
sand
and
then
got
up
like
crazy
drunk
and
tried
to
slug
the
men
carrying
him
away
and
yelled
for
his
sword
but
he
fainted
The
kid
came
out
and
had
to
kill
five
bulls
because
you
can
’
t
have
more
than
three
matadors
and
the
last
bull
he
was
so
tired
he
couldn
’
t
get
the
sword
in
He
couldn
’
t
hardly
lift
his
arm
He
tried
five
times
and
the
crowd
was
quiet
because
it
was
a
good
bull
and
it
looked
like
him
or
the
bull
and
then
he
finally
made
it
He
sat
down
in
the
sand
and
puked
and
they
held
a
cape
over
him
while
the
crowd
hollered
and
threw
things
down
into
the
bull
ring
MINARETS
stuck
up
in
the
rain
out
of
Adrianople
across
the
mud
flats
The
carts
were
jammed
for
thirty
miles
along
the
Karagatch
road
Water
buffalo
and
cattle
were
hauling
carts
through
the
mud
No
end
and
no
beginning
Just
carts
loaded
with
everything
they
owned
The
old
men
and
women
soaked
through
walked
along
keeping
the
cattle
moving
The
Maritza
was
running
yellow
almost
up
to
the
bridge
Carts
were
jammed
solid
on
the
bridge
with
camels
bobbing
along
through
them
Greek
cavalry
herded
along
the
procession
Women
and
kids
were
in
the
carts
crouched
with
mattresses
mirrors
sewing
machines
bundles
There
was
a
woman
having
a
kid
with
a
young
girl
holding
a
blanket
over
her
and
crying
Scared
sick
looking
at
it
It
rained
all
through
the
evacuation
WE
were
in
a
garden
at
Mons
Young
Buckley
came
in
with
his
patrol
from
across
the
river
The
first
German
I
saw
climbed
up
over
the
garden
wall
We
waited
till
he
got
one
leg
over
and
then
potted
him
He
had
so
much
equipment
on
and
looked
awfully
surprised
and
fell
down
into
the
garden
Then
three
more
came
over
further
down
the
wall
We
shot
them
They
all
came
just
like
that
IT
was
a
frightfully
hot
day
We
’
d
jammed
an
absolutely
perfect
barricade
across
the
bridge
It
was
simply
priceless
A
big
old
wrought
iron
grating
from
the
front
of
a
house
Too
heavy
to
lift
and
you
could
shoot
through
it
and
they
would
have
to
climb
over
it
It
was
absolutely
topping
They
tried
to
get
over
it
and
we
potted
them
from
forty
yards
They
rushed
it
and
officers
came
out
alone
and
worked
on
it
It
was
an
absolutely
perfect
obstacle
Their
officers
were
very
fine
We
were
frightfully
put
out
when
we
heard
the
flank
had
gone
and
we
had
to
fall
back
THEY
shot
the
six
cabinet
ministers
at
half-past
six
in
the
morning
against
the
wall
of
a
hospital
There
were
pools
of
water
in
the
courtyard
There
were
wet
dead
leaves
on
the
paving
of
the
courtyard
It
rained
hard
All
the
shutters
of
the
hospital
were
nailed
shut
One
of
the
ministers
was
sick
with
typhoid
Two
soldiers
carried
him
downstairs
and
out
into
the
rain
They
tried
to
hold
him
up
against
the
wall
but
he
sat
down
in
a
puddle
of
water
The
other
five
stood
very
quietly
against
the
wall
Finally
the
officer
told
the
soldiers
it
was
no
good
trying
to
make
him
stand
up
When
they
fired
the
first
volley
he
was
sitting
down
in
the
water
with
his
head
on
his
knees
NICK
sat
against
the
wall
of
the
church
where
they
had
dragged
him
to
be
clear
of
machine
gun
fire
in
the
street
Both
legs
stuck
out
awkwardly
He
had
been
hit
in
the
spine
His
face
was
sweaty
and
dirty
The
sun
shone
on
his
face
The
day
was
very
hot
Rinaldi
big
backed
his
equipment
sprawling
lay
face
downward
against
the
wall
Nick
looked
straight
ahead
brilliantly
The
pink
wall
of
the
house
opposite
had
fallen
out
from
the
roof
and
an
iron
bedstead
hung
twisted
toward
the
street
Two
Austrian
dead
lay
in
the
rubble
in
the
shade
of
the
house
Up
the
street
were
other
dead
Things
were
getting
forward
in
the
town
It
was
going
well
Stretcher
bearers
would
be
along
any
time
now
Nick
turned
his
head
carefully
and
looked
down
at
Rinaldi
“
Senta
Rinaldi
Senta
You
and
me
we
’
ve
made
a
separate
peace
”
Rinaldi
lay
still
in
the
sun
breathing
with
difficulty
“
Not
patriots
”
Nick
turned
his
head
carefully
away
smiling
sweatily
Rinaldi
was
a
disappointing
audience
WHILE
the
bombardment
was
knocking
the
trench
to
pieces
at
Fossalta
he
lay
very
flat
and
sweated
and
prayed
oh
jesus
christ
get
me
out
of
here
Dear
jesus
please
get
me
out
Christ
please
please
please
christ
If
you
’
ll
only
keep
me
from
getting
killed
I
’
ll
do
anything
you
say
I
believe
in
you
and
I
’
ll
tell
everyone
in
the
world
that
you
are
the
only
thing
that
matters
Please
please
dear
jesus
The
shelling
moved
further
up
the
line
We
went
to
work
on
the
trench
and
in
the
morning
the
sun
came
up
and
the
day
was
hot
and
muggy
and
cheerful
and
quiet
The
next
night
back
at
Mestre
he
did
not
tell
the
girl
he
went
upstairs
with
at
the
Villa
Rossa
about
Jesus
And
he
never
told
anybody
AT
two
o
’
clock
in
the
morning
two
Hungarians
got
into
a
cigar
store
at
Fifteenth
Street
and
Grand
Avenue
Drevitts
and
Boyle
drove
up
from
the
Fifteenth
Street
police
station
in
a
Ford
The
Hungarians
were
backing
their
wagon
out
of
an
alley
Boyle
shot
one
off
the
seat
of
the
wagon
and
one
out
of
the
wagon
box
Drevetts
got
frightened
when
he
found
they
were
both
dead
Hell
Jimmy
he
said
you
oughtn
’
t
to
have
done
it
There
’
s
liable
to
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
trouble
—
They
’
re
crooks
ain
’
t
they
said
Boyle
They
’
re
wops
ain
’
t
they
Who
the
hell
is
going
to
make
any
trouble
—
That
’
s
all
right
maybe
this
time
said
Drevitts
but
how
did
you
know
they
were
wops
when
you
bumped
them
Wops
said
Boyle
I
can
tell
wops
a
mile
off
ONE
hot
evening
in
Milan
they
carried
him
up
onto
the
roof
and
he
could
look
out
over
the
top
of
the
town
There
were
chimney
swifts
in
the
sky
After
a
while
it
got
dark
and
the
searchlights
came
out
The
others
went
down
and
took
the
bottles
with
them
He
and
Ag
could
hear
them
below
on
the
balcony
Ag
sat
on
the
bed
She
was
cool
and
fresh
in
the
hot
night
Ag
stayed
on
night
duty
for
three
months
They
were
glad
to
let
her
When
they
operated
on
him
she
prepared
him
for
the
operating
table
and
they
had
a
joke
about
friend
or
enema
He
went
under
the
anæsthetic
holding
tight
on
to
himself
so
that
he
would
not
blab
about
anything
during
the
silly
talky
time
After
he
got
on
crutches
he
used
to
take
the
temperature
so
Ag
would
not
have
to
get
up
from
the
bed
There
were
only
a
few
patients
and
they
all
knew
about
it
They
all
liked
Ag
As
he
walked
back
along
the
halls
he
thought
of
Ag
in
his
bed
Before
he
went
back
to
the
front
they
went
into
the
Duomo
and
prayed
It
was
dim
and
quiet
and
there
were
other
people
praying
They
wanted
to
get
married
but
there
was
not
enough
time
for
the
banns
and
neither
of
them
had
birth
certificates
They
felt
as
though
they
were
married
but
they
wanted
everyone
to
know
about
it
and
to
make
it
so
they
could
not
lose
it
Ag
wrote
him
many
letters
that
he
never
got
until
after
the
armistice
Fifteen
came
in
a
bunch
and
he
sorted
them
by
the
dates
and
read
them
all
straight
through
They
were
about
the
hospital
and
how
much
she
loved
him
and
how
it
was
impossible
to
get
along
without
him
and
how
terrible
it
was
missing
him
at
night
After
the
armistice
they
agreed
he
should
go
home
to
get
a
job
so
they
might
be
married
Ag
would
not
come
home
until
he
had
a
good
job
and
could
come
to
New
York
to
meet
her
It
was
understood
he
would
not
drink
and
he
did
not
want
to
see
his
friends
or
anyone
in
the
States
Only
to
get
a
job
and
be
married
On
the
train
from
Padova
to
Milan
they
quarrelled
about
her
not
being
willing
to
come
home
at
once
When
they
had
to
say
good-bye
in
the
station
at
Padova
they
kissed
good-bye
but
were
not
finished
with
the
quarrel
He
felt
sick
about
saying
good-bye
like
that
He
went
to
America
on
a
boat
from
Genoa
Ag
went
back
to
Torre
di
Mosta
to
open
a
hospital
It
was
lonely
and
rainy
there
and
there
was
a
battalion
of
arditi
quartered
in
the
town
Living
in
the
muddy
rainy
town
in
the
winter
the
major
of
the
battalion
made
love
to
Ag
and
she
had
never
known
Italians
before
and
finally
wrote
a
letter
to
the
States
that
theirs
had
been
only
a
boy
and
girl
affair
She
was
sorry
and
she
knew
he
would
probably
not
be
able
to
understand
but
might
some
day
forgive
her
and
be
grateful
to
her
and
she
expected
absolutely
unexpectedly
to
be
married
in
the
spring
She
loved
him
as
always
but
she
realized
now
it
was
only
a
boy
and
girl
love
She
hoped
he
would
have
a
great
career
and
believed
in
him
absolutely
She
knew
it
was
for
the
best
The
Major
did
not
marry
her
in
the
spring
or
any
other
time
Ag
never
got
an
answer
to
her
letter
to
Chicago
about
it
A
short
time
after
he
contracted
gonorrhea
from
a
sales
girl
from
The
Fair
riding
in
a
taxicab
through
Lincoln
Park
IN
1919
he
was
traveling
on
the
railroads
in
Italy
carrying
a
square
of
oilcloth
from
the
headquarters
of
the
party
written
in
indelible
pencil
and
saying
here
was
a
comrade
who
had
suffered
very
much
under
the
whites
in
Budapest
and
requesting
comrades
to
aid
him
in
any
way
He
used
this
instead
of
a
ticket
He
was
very
shy
and
quite
young
and
the
train
men
passed
him
on
from
one
crew
to
another
He
had
no
money
and
they
fed
him
behind
the
counter
in
railway
eating
houses
He
was
delighted
with
Italy
It
was
a
beautiful
country
he
said
The
people
were
all
kind
He
had
been
in
many
towns
walked
much
and
seen
many
pictures
Giotto
Masaccio
and
Piero
della
Francesca
he
bought
reproductions
of
and
carried
them
wrapped
in
a
copy
of
Avanti
Mantegna
he
did
not
like
He
reported
at
Bologna
and
I
took
him
with
me
up
into
the
Romagna
where
it
was
necessary
I
go
to
see
a
man
We
had
a
good
trip
together
It
was
early
September
and
the
country
was
pleasant
He
was
a
Magyar
a
very
nice
boy
and
very
shy
Horthey
’
s
men
had
done
some
bad
things
to
him
He
talked
about
it
a
little
In
spite
of
Italy
he
believed
altogether
in
the
world
revolution
—
But
how
is
the
movement
going
in
Italy
he
asked
—
Very
badly
I
said
—
But
it
will
go
better
he
said
You
have
everything
here
It
is
the
one
country
that
everyone
is
sure
of
It
will
be
the
starting
point
of
everything
At
Bologna
he
said
good-bye
to
us
to
go
on
the
train
to
Milano
and
then
to
Aosta
to
walk
over
the
pass
into
Switzerland
I
spoke
to
him
about
the
Mantegnas
in
Milano
No
he
said
very
shyly
he
did
not
like
the
Mantegnas
I
wrote
out
for
him
where
to
eat
in
Milano
and
the
addresses
of
comrades
He
thanked
me
very
much
but
his
mind
was
already
looking
forward
to
walking
over
the
pass
He
was
very
eager
to
walk
over
the
pass
while
the
weather
held
good
The
last
I
heard
of
him
the
Swiss
had
him
in
jail
near
Sion
THEY
whack
whacked
the
white
horse
on
the
legs
and
he
knee-ed
himself
up
The
picador
twisted
the
stirrups
straight
and
pulled
and
hauled
up
into
the
saddle
The
horse
’
s
entrails
hung
down
in
a
blue
bunch
and
swung
backward
and
forward
as
he
began
to
canter
the
monos
whacking
him
on
the
back
of
his
legs
with
the
rods
He
cantered
jerkily
along
the
barrera
He
stopped
stiff
and
one
of
the
monos
held
his
bridle
and
walked
him
forward
The
picador
kicked
in
his
spurs
leaned
forward
and
shook
his
lance
at
the
bull
Blood
pumped
regularly
from
between
the
horse
’
s
front
legs
He
was
nervously
wobbly
The
bull
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
charge
THE
crowd
shouted
all
the
time
and
threw
pieces
of
bread
down
into
the
ring
then
cushions
and
leather
wine
bottles
keeping
up
whistling
and
yelling
Finally
the
bull
was
too
tired
from
so
much
bad
sticking
and
folded
his
knees
and
lay
down
and
one
of
the
cuadrilla
leaned
out
over
his
neck
and
killed
him
with
the
puntillo
The
crowd
came
over
the
barrera
and
around
the
torero
and
two
men
grabbed
him
and
held
him
and
some
one
cut
off
his
pigtail
and
was
waving
it
and
a
kid
grabbed
it
and
ran
away
with
it
Afterwards
I
saw
him
at
the
café
He
was
very
short
with
a
brown
face
and
quite
drunk
and
he
said
after
all
it
has
happened
before
like
that
I
am
not
really
a
good
bull
fighter
IF
it
happened
right
down
close
in
front
of
you
you
could
see
Villalta
snarl
at
the
bull
and
curse
him
and
when
the
bull
charged
he
swung
back
firmly
like
an
oak
when
the
wind
hits
it
his
legs
tight
together
the
muleta
trailing
and
the
sword
following
the
curve
behind
Then
he
cursed
the
bull
flopped
the
muleta
at
him
and
swung
back
from
the
charge
his
feet
firm
the
muleta
curving
and
each
swing
the
crowd
roaring
When
he
started
to
kill
it
was
all
in
the
same
rush
The
bull
looking
at
him
straight
in
front
hating
He
drew
out
the
sword
from
the
folds
of
the
muleta
and
sighted
with
the
same
movement
and
called
to
the
bull
Toro
Toro
and
the
bull
charged
and
Villalta
charged
and
just
for
a
moment
they
became
one
Villalta
became
one
with
the
bull
and
then
it
was
over
Villalta
standing
straight
and
the
red
hilt
of
the
sword
sticking
out
dully
between
the
bull
’
s
shoulders
Villalta
his
hand
up
at
the
crowd
and
the
bull
roaring
blood
looking
straight
at
Villatal
and
his
legs
caving
I
heard
the
drums
coming
down
the
street
and
then
the
fifes
and
the
pipes
and
then
they
came
around
the
corner
all
dancing
The
street
full
of
them
Maera
saw
him
and
then
I
saw
him
When
they
stopped
the
music
for
the
crouch
he
hunched
down
in
the
street
with
them
all
and
when
they
started
it
again
he
jumped
up
and
went
dancing
down
the
street
with
them
He
was
drunk
all
right
You
go
down
after
him
said
Maera
he
hates
me
So
I
went
down
and
caught
up
with
them
and
grabbed
him
while
he
was
crouched
down
waiting
for
the
music
to
break
loose
and
said
Come
on
Luis
For
Christ
sake
you
’
ve
got
bulls
this
afternoon
He
didn
’
t
listen
to
me
he
was
listening
so
hard
for
the
music
to
start
I
said
Don
’
t
be
a
damn
fool
Luis
Come
on
back
to
the
hotel
Then
the
music
started
up
again
and
he
jumped
up
and
twisted
away
from
me
and
started
dancing
I
grabbed
his
arm
and
he
pulled
loose
and
said
Oh
leave
me
alone
You
’
re
not
my
father
I
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
Maera
was
on
the
balcony
looking
out
to
see
if
I
’
d
be
bringing
him
back
He
went
inside
when
he
saw
me
and
came
downstairs
disgusted
Well
I
said
after
all
he
’
s
just
an
ignorant
Mexican
savage
Yes
Maera
said
and
who
will
kill
his
bulls
after
he
gets
a
cogida
We
I
suppose
I
said
Yes
we
said
Maera
We
kills
the
savages
’
bulls
and
the
drunkards
’
bulls
and
the
riau-riau
dancers
’
bulls
Yes
We
kill
them
We
kill
them
all
right
Yes
Yes
Yes
MAERA
lay
still
his
head
on
his
arms
his
face
in
the
sand
He
felt
warm
and
sticky
from
the
bleeding
Each
time
he
felt
the
horn
coming
Sometimes
the
bull
only
bumped
him
with
his
head
Once
the
horn
went
all
the
way
through
him
and
he
felt
it
go
into
the
sand
Someone
had
the
bull
by
the
tail
They
were
swearing
at
him
and
flopping
the
cape
in
his
face
Then
the
bull
was
gone
Some
men
picked
Maera
up
and
started
to
run
with
him
toward
the
barriers
through
the
gate
out
the
passage
way
around
under
the
grand
stand
to
the
infirmary
They
laid
Maera
down
on
a
cot
and
one
of
the
men
went
out
for
the
doctor
The
others
stood
around
The
doctor
came
running
from
the
corral
where
he
had
been
sewing
up
picador
horses
He
had
to
stop
and
wash
his
hands
There
was
a
great
shouting
going
on
in
the
grandstand
overhead
Maera
wanted
to
say
something
and
found
he
could
not
talk
Maera
felt
everything
getting
larger
and
larger
and
then
smaller
and
smaller
Then
it
got
larger
and
larger
and
larger
and
then
smaller
and
smaller
Then
everything
commenced
to
run
faster
and
faster
as
when
they
speed
up
a
cinematograph
film
Then
he
was
dead
THEY
hanged
Sam
Cardinella
at
six
o
’
clock
in
the
morning
in
the
corridors
of
the
county
jail
The
corridor
was
high
and
narrow
with
tiers
of
cells
on
either
side
All
the
cells
were
occupied
The
men
had
been
brought
in
for
the
hanging
Five
men
sentenced
to
be
hanged
were
in
the
five
top
cells
Three
of
the
men
to
be
hanged
were
negroes
They
were
very
frightened
One
of
the
white
men
sat
on
his
cot
with
his
head
in
his
hands
The
other
lay
flat
on
his
cot
with
a
blanket
wrapped
around
his
head
They
came
out
onto
the
gallows
through
a
door
in
the
wall
There
were
six
or
seven
of
them
including
two
priests
There
were
carrying
Sam
Cardinella
He
had
been
like
that
since
about
four
o
’
clock
in
the
morning
While
they
were
strapping
his
legs
together
two
guards
held
him
up
and
the
two
priests
were
whispering
to
him
“
Be
a
man
my
son
”
said
one
priest
When
they
came
toward
him
with
the
cap
to
go
over
his
head
Sam
Cardinella
lost
control
of
his
sphincter
muscle
The
guards
who
had
been
holding
him
up
dropped
him
They
were
both
disgusted
“
How
about
a
chair
Will
”
asked
one
of
the
guards
“
Better
get
one
”
said
a
man
in
a
derby
hat
When
they
all
stepped
back
on
the
scaffolding
back
of
the
drop
which
was
very
heavy
built
of
oak
and
steel
and
swung
on
ball
bearings
Sam
Cardinella
was
left
sitting
there
strapped
tight
the
younger
of
the
two
priests
kneeling
beside
the
chair
The
priest
skipped
back
onto
the
scaffolding
just
before
the
drop
fell
THE
king
was
working
in
the
garden
He
seemed
very
glad
to
see
me
We
walked
through
the
garden
This
is
the
queen
he
said
She
was
clipping
a
rose
bush
Oh
how
do
you
do
she
said
We
sat
down
at
a
table
under
a
big
tree
and
the
king
ordered
whiskey
and
soda
We
have
good
whiskey
anyway
he
said
The
revolutionary
committee
he
told
me
would
not
allow
him
to
go
outside
the
palace
grounds
Plastiras
is
a
very
good
man
I
believe
he
said
but
frightfully
difficult
I
think
he
did
right
though
shooting
those
chaps
If
Kerensky
had
shot
a
few
men
things
might
have
been
altogether
different
Of
course
the
great
thing
in
this
sort
of
an
affair
is
not
to
be
shot
oneself
It
was
very
jolly
We
talked
for
a
long
time
Like
all
Greeks
he
wanted
to
go
America
I
guess
looking
at
it
now
my
old
man
was
cut
out
for
a
fat
guy
one
of
those
regular
little
roly
fat
guys
you
see
around
but
he
sure
never
got
that
way
except
a
little
toward
the
last
and
then
it
was
n't
his
fault
he
was
riding
over
the
jumps
only
and
he
could
afford
to
carry
plenty
of
weight
then
I
remember
the
way
he
'd
pull
on
a
rubber
shirt
over
a
couple
of
jerseys
and
a
big
sweat
shirt
over
that
and
get
me
to
run
with
him
in
the
forenoon
in
the
hot
sun
He
'd
have
maybe
taken
a
trial
trip
with
one
of
Razzo
's
skins
early
in
the
morning
after
just
getting
in
from
Torino
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
beating
it
out
to
the
stables
in
a
cab
and
then
with
the
dew
all
over
everything
and
the
sun
just
starting
to
get
going
I
'd
help
him
pull
off
his
boots
and
he
'd
get
into
a
pair
of
sneakers
and
all
these
sweaters
and
we
'd
start
out
Come
on
kid
he
'd
say
stepping
up
and
down
on
his
toes
in
front
of
the
jock
's
dressing
room
let
's
get
moving
Then
we
'd
start
off
jogging
around
the
infield
once
maybe
with
him
ahead
running
nice
and
then
turn
out
the
gate
and
along
one
of
those
roads
with
all
the
trees
along
both
sides
of
them
that
run
out
from
San
Siro
I
'd
go
ahead
of
him
when
we
hit
the
road
and
I
could
run
pretty
stout
and
I
'd
look
around
and
he
'd
be
jogging
easy
just
behind
me
and
after
a
little
while
I
'd
look
around
again
and
he
'd
begun
to
sweat
Sweating
heavy
and
he
'd
just
he
clogging
it
along
with
his
eyes
on
my
back
but
when
he
'd
catch
me
looking
at
him
he
'd
grin
and
say
Sweating
plenty
When
my
old
man
grinned
nobody
could
help
but
grin
too
We
'd
keep
right
on
running
out
toward
the
mountains
and
then
my
old
man
would
yell
Hey
Joe
and
I
'd
look
back
and
he
'd
he
sitting
under
a
tree
with
a
towel
he
'd
had
around
his
waist
wrapped
around
his
neck
I
'd
come
back
and
sit
down
beside
him
and
he
'd
pull
a
rope
out
of
his
pocket
and
start
skipping
rope
out
in
the
sun
with
the
sweat
pouring
off
his
face
and
him
skipping
rope
out
in
the
white
dust
with
the
rope
going
cloppetty
cloppety
clop
clop
clop
and
the
sun
hotter
and
him
working
harder
up
and
down
a
patch
of
the
road
Say
it
was
a
treat
to
see
my
old
man
skip
rope
too
He
could
whirr
it
fast
or
lop
it
slow
and
fancy
Say
you
ought
to
have
seen
wops
look
at
us
sometimes
when
they
'd
come
by
going
into
town
walking
along
with
big
white
steers
hauling
the
cart
They
sure
looked
as
though
they
thought
the
old
man
was
nuts
He
'd
start
the
rope
whirring
till
they
'd
stop
dead
still
and
watch
him
then
give
the
steers
a
cluck
and
a
poke
with
the
goad
and
get
going
again
When
I
'd
sit
watching
him
working
out
in
the
hot
sun
I
sure
felt
fond
of
him
He
sure
was
fun
and
he
done
his
work
so
hard
and
he
'd
finish
up
with
a
regular
whirring
that
'd
drive
the
sweat
out
on
his
face
like
water
and
then
sling
the
rope
at
the
tree
and
come
over
and
sit
down
with
me
and
lean
back
against
the
tree
with
the
towel
and
a
sweater
wrapped
around
his
neck
Sure
is
hell
keeping
it
down
Joe
he
'd
say
and
lean
back
and
shut
his
eyes
and
breath
long
and
deep
it
aint
like
when
you
're
a
kid
Then
he
'd
get
up
before
he
started
to
cool
and
we
'd
jog
along
back
to
the
stables
That
's
the
way
it
was
keeping
down
to
weight
He
was
worried
all
the
time
Most
jocks
can
just
about
ride
off
all
they
want
to
A
jock
loses
about
a
kilo
every
time
he
rides
but
my
old
man
was
sort
of
dried
out
and
he
could
n't
keep
down
his
kilos
without
all
that
running
I
remember
once
at
San
Siro
Regoli
a
little
wop
that
was
riding
for
Buzoni
came
out
across
the
paddock
going
to
the
bar
for
something
cool
and
flicking
his
bouts
with
his
whip
after
he
'd
just
weighed
in
and
my
old
man
had
just
weighed
in
too
and
came
out
with
the
saddle
under
his
arm
looking
red
faced
and
tired
and
too
big
for
his
silks
and
he
stood
there
looking
at
young
Regoli
standing
up
to
the
outdoors
bar
cool
and
kid
looking
and
I
says
What
's
the
matter
Dad
cause
I
thought
maybe
Regoli
had
bumped
him
or
something
and
he
just
looked
at
Regoli
and
said
Oh
to
hell
with
it
and
went
on
to
the
dressing
room
Well
it
would
have
been
all
right
maybe
if
we
'd
stayed
in
Milan
and
ridden
at
Milan
and
Torino
cause
if
there
ever
were
any
easy
courses
its
those
two
Pianola
Joe
My
old
man
said
when
he
dismounted
in
the
winning
stall
after
what
the
wops
thought
was
a
hell
of
a
steeplechase
I
asked
him
once
This
course
rides
its-self
It
's
the
pace
you
're
going
at
that
makes
riding
the
jumps
dangerous
Joe
We
aint
going
any
pace
here
and
they
aint
any
really
bad
jumps
either
But
it
's
the
pace
always
not
the
jumps
that
makes
the
trouble
San
Siro
was
the
swellest
course
I
'd
ever
seen
but
the
old
man
said
it
was
a
dog
's
life
Going
back
and
forth
between
Mirafiore
and
San
Siro
and
riding
just
about
every
day
in
the
week
with
a
train
ride
every
other
night
I
was
nuts
about
the
horses
too
There
's
something
about
it
when
they
come
out
and
go
up
the
track
to
the
post
Sort
of
dancy
and
tight
looking
with
the
jock
keeping
a
tight
hold
on
them
and
maybe
easing
off
a
little
and
letting
them
run
a
little
going
up
Then
once
they
were
at
the
barrier
it
got
me
worse
than
anything
Especially
at
San
Siro
with
that
big
green
infield
and
the
mountains
way
off
and
the
fat
wop
starter
with
his
big
whip
and
the
jocks
fiddling
them
around
and
then
the
barrier
snapping
up
and
that
bell
going
off
and
them
all
getting
off
in
a
bunch
and
then
commencing
to
string
out
You
know
the
way
a
bunch
of
skins
gets
off
If
you
're
up
in
the
stand
with
a
pair
of
glasses
all
you
see
is
them
plunging
off
and
then
that
bell
goes
off
and
it
seems
like
it
rings
for
a
thousand
years
and
then
they
come
sweeping
round
the
turn
There
was
n't
ever
anything
like
it
for
me
But
my
old
man
said
one
day
in
the
dressing
room
when
he
was
getting
into
his
street
clothes
None
of
these
things
are
horses
Joe
They
'd
kill
that
bunch
of
skates
for
their
hides
and
hoofs
up
at
Paris
That
was
the
day
he
'd
won
the
Premio
Commercio
with
Lantorna
shooting
her
out
of
the
field
the
last
hundred
meters
like
pulling
a
cork
out
of
a
bottle
It
was
right
after
the
Premio
Commercio
that
we
pulled
out
and
left
Italy
My
old
man
and
Holbrook
and
a
fat
wop
in
a
straw
hat
that
kept
wiping
his
face
with
a
handkerchief
were
having
an
argument
at
a
table
in
the
Galleria
They
were
all
talking
French
and
the
two
of
them
were
after
my
old
man
about
something
Finally
he
did
n't
say
anything
any
more
but
just
sat
there
and
looked
at
Holbrook
and
the
two
of
them
kept
after
him
first
one
talking
and
then
the
other
and
the
fat
wop
always
butting
in
on
Holbrook
You
go
