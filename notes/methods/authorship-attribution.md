Linguistic Features

"idividual words an author uses can be
strong cues to his or her identity"

"length"
"number of syllables"
"part of speech"
"vocabulary richness"
"synonym pairs" (Mosteller and Wallace)
"function words" (N most common)
"N-grams"
"POS N-gram"
"Burrows Delta"

" it is probably fair to say that
the accuracy baseline as currently established, as well as the most well-
known techniques, derive from simple statistics such as PCA, applied
to the top 50 or so words of the corpus "

"the best results will come from analysis of an extremely broad set of
features [1, 157]"

"there appears to be general agreement that both function words
(or sometimes merely frequent words) and POS tags are good
features to include. Methods that do not use syntax in one
form or another, either through the use of word
n-grams or explicit syntactic coding tend to perform poorly."

"Hota’s study of Shakespearean gender is also an example of a study
in  document  dating;  Hota  “somewhat  arbitrarily”  divided  his  cor-
pus into Early and Late plays (pre- and post-1600) and analyzed the
two groups separately. There was a substantial difference in accuracy
between the two groups, indicating “that there is a greater stylistic
difference between the genders in late Shakespeare than early Shake-
speare.”  This  is,  of  course,  evidence  of  stylistic  development  over
Shakespeare’s  career.  Of  course,  establishing  this  development  does
not establish how and why this development happened; the cause may
be as simple (and uninteresting) as increasing the number of female
characters, or as significant as the development of a female-specific
vocabulary.
Similar studies have found such development in other writers’ as
well; Examples include [23, 62, 79, 119]. Figure 7.1 shows an example
of such development in the novels of Henry James. Unlike [66], this igure was produced by unsupervised analysis (PCA of the 990 most
common words) and does not involve arbitrary categorization of texts;
instead they are simply scatter-plotted by date across the first two
principal components. The pattern that emerges is a clear picture of
stylistic development; novels known to be earlier sort themselves to the
left of the diagram. A similar picture of stylistic development can be
seen in Figure 5.3, covering the work of Jack London [79]. Indeed, this
may be even more striking, given the apparent lack of pattern prior to
1912 and after 1912, but the clear linear separation between early and
late works; indeed, this picture argues for a non-arbitrary classification
as of 1912 for the works of Jack London."
