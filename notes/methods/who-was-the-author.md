https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240414953/download

"The primary application of stylometry is to attributional studies, yet a methodology 
successful   for   one   attributional   problem   does   not   necessarily   work   for   another. "

"What Burrows did 
was  to  use large  sets, typically seventy-five strong,  of  common high-frequency function 
words, compute their rates of occurrence per thousand words in the candidate texts, and 
employ what is essentially principal components analysis on the resulting multivariate data 
array."
