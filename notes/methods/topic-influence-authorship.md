# Topic Influence in Authorship

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221300170_Investigating_Topic_Influence_in_Authorship_Attribution

"The results showed that most of the variables
exhibit considerable correlation with the text topic and their
exploitation in authorship analysis should be done with caution"

"Stylometric variables used in authorship attribution should be
independent of any metalinguistic entity, that is genre, topic,
medium, chronological era etc."

"The authorship attribution achieved an overall 96% accuracy,
showing that the selected feature set was indeed useful in
capturing authorship information. However, the topic
categorization accuracy was also very high (79.5%), especially if
we consider that we used only stylometric variables and no
content words at all. This result indicates that the features used, at
least some of them, correlate with topic information and are not
topic-neutral."

"In order to test the discriminatory power of the above-mentioned
features, we used DFA, a well documented classification function,
which has been used extensively in authorship attribution research"

"Authorship attribution could
become a by-product of the correlation of authors with specific
topics."
