# Quantitative patterns of stylistic influence in the evolution of literature

"Their joint frequency of usage is known to
provide a useful stylistic fingerprint for authorship (8, 11), and
thus suggests a method of comparing author styles. When we
consider content-free word frequencies from a large number
of authors and works over a long period of time, we can ask ques-
tions related to temporal trends in similarity. The primary results
of our analysis are that time provides the most coherent means
of clustering work and a trend of diminishing stylistic influence
as we move forward in time. Such a finding is consistent with
a simple evolutionary model for stylistic influence, which assumes
that imitation attends preferentially to contemporary authors"

"After counting the occurrences of
each content-free word for each work by a particular author, we aggregated
these counts and normalized them so that the components summed to 1
(L1-norm). We then took each of these normalized vectors to be the feature
vector for the corresponding author. We compared authors by computing
the symmetrized Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence between their feature vectors"
