# Hemingway Stylometry
A public repository to house my research on Hemingway's Paris reading list.

This repository contains everything - code files, notes, articles, visualivisualizations, etc. - from every step in my research process.

Big thanks to Princeton's [Mapping Expatriate Paris project](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/mapping-expatriate-paris) for opening up their data to the public! The file /data/hemingway.tei.xml comes from their repository.

All texts included in /data/books/ are, to the best of my knowledge, in US public domain. I have sourced them from a variety of online locations. The sources are noted in /data/books_before_sun.csv. If you would like to use these texts, please take care to cite the original electronic versions.
