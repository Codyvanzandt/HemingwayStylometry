# Hemingway Stylometry
A public repository to house my research on Hemingway's Paris reading list.

This repository houses everything - code files, notes, articles, visualivisualizations, etc. - from every step in my research process.

Big thanks to Princeton's [Mapping Expatriate Paris project](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/mapping-expatriate-paris) for opening up their data to the public!
