# Hemingway Stylometry
A public repository to house my research on Hemingway's Paris reading list.

This contains every document (code files, notes, articles, visualizations, etc.) from every step in my research process.

Shoutout to Princeton's [Mapping Expatriate Paris project](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/mapping-expatriate-paris) for opening up their data to the public!
